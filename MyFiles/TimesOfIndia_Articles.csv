Han Kuo-yu won the primary for the Kuomintang (KMT), comfortably seeing off a challenge from Taiwan's richest man, billionaire Foxconn founder Terry Gou. His victory sets up an unpredictable clash as Taiwan goes to the polls in January in a contest that will be dominated by relations with China. Han, 62, has enjoyed a stunning rise in the last two years, journeying from relative obscurity to become his party's presidential candidate in a phenomenon that has been dubbed the ""Han tide"". Some have likened him to US President Donald Trump and other populist leaders who hail from outside establishment circles and command a fervent voter base buoyed by lofty promises of resurrecting their fortunes. Han won 45 percent of votes cast in the KMT's primary -- which polls members of the public by telephone -- compared with Gou's 28 percent, a setback for a man who made his fortune assembling iPhones and other key electronic devices in Chinese mainland factories. Han was a relative unknown until he seized the Kaohsiung mayoralty in local elections last year in a shock win in the southern city that has long been a heartland for Tsai's ruling Democratic Progressive Party. He has been able to muster huge, enthusiastic crowds during campaigning, where he has vowed to restore warm ties with Beijing and kickstart the economy. ""Taiwanese people have been living difficult lives in the past three years,"" he told reporters after the result was announced. Gou, who had previously hinted he might run as an independent if he lost, issued a statement congratulating his opponent. Relations with Beijing have soured since Tsai came to power in 2016 because her party refuses to recognise the idea that Taiwan is part of ""one China"". Since her election Beijing has cut official communications, ramped up military exercises, poached diplomatic allies and ratcheted up economic pressure on the island. Taiwan has been a de facto sovereign nation since the end of a civil war in 1949 but China still views it as its territory and has vowed to seize it, by force if necessary. Tsai has described the 2020 presidential election as a ""fight for freedom and democracy"", setting herself up as someone who can defend Taiwan from an increasingly assertive Beijing. Under her administration, relations have warmed with Washington which recognises Beijing over Taipei but remains the island's primary diplomatic and military ally. Supporters see Han as a plain-talking maverick but detractors are unnerved by his efforts promoting warmer China ties. He has shown a knack for using the criticism to his advantage. When a spokesman for Tsai dismissed Han as something of a country bumpkin by calling him an ""earthen steamed bun"" he responded by presiding over a steamed bun cooking competition. He has also embraced nicknames like ""bald guy"" and ""vegetable man"", the latter a reference to a previous job as general manager of the Taipei Agricultural Products Marketing Corporation. ""He's a charismatic campaigner and he drummed up lots of enthusiasm for his mayoral bid,"" Shelley Rigger, an expert on Taiwan at Davidson College in North Carolina, told AFP. ""He's struggled a bit with substance, especially on cross-Strait relations, where his position has bounced around,"" she added, referring to ties with Beijing. While a large number of older people favour warmer relationship with the mainland, many younger Taiwanese are now adopting an increasingly wary view towards China and a staunchly independent identity. A bellicose New Year speech by Chinese president Xi Jinping and the recent political chaos in Hong Kong has further inflamed fears in Taiwan over what the future holds if Beijing has its way, with Tsai seeing her previously moribund poll ratings rise.

The incident comes as the Taliban are discussing a peace deal with the United States that could see them re-joining mainstream society, and that has brought new scrutiny of their attitudes to issues like women's rights and the media. The private radio station, Samaa, has been broadcasting political, religious, social and entertainment programmes in the central province of Ghazni since 2013. Its 13 employees, including three women presenters, broadcast in Afghanistan's two main languages - Dari and Pashto. The radio station's director, Ramez Azimi, said Taliban commanders in the area had sent written warnings and telephoned in, to tell the radio station to stop employing women. ""The Taliban also came to my house and issued a threat,"" Azimi said. He said the threats had forced him to suspend broadcasts. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid denied that a Taliban commander had issued the threats. ""We are trying to find details,"" said Mujahid. The Taliban say many people falsely identify themselves as Taliban, often in the course of private disputes. Several districts of Ghazni are under Taliban control. The militants hold sway over about half of Afghanistan and they have been intensifying their attacks despite efforts towards a peace agreement to end the 18-year war. The Taliban ruled most of Afghanistan from 1996 until 2001. Under their hardline interpretation of Islamic law, women were banned women from working or going to school. But the Taliban have recently been projecting themselves as a more moderate force. In a recent statement they said Islam gave women rights in areas including business and ownership, inheritance, education, work, choosing a husband, security and well-being. But they denounced ""so-called women's rights activists"" who encouraged women to defy Afghan customs. The Taliban have staged numerous deadly attacks against the media and Afghanistan is one of the world's most dangerous countries for journalists. The Taliban say they only target media that is biased against them.

Prayuth stays on as prime minister with the backing of pro-military parties in parliament and a military-appointed upper house under a constitution that critics say stifles democracy and enshrines a political role for the military. Prayuth, in a televised address to the nation, said military rule had brought success in many areas, from fixing the problem of illegal fishing and human trafficking, to the rescue of 12 boys and their soccer coach trapped in a flooded cave last year. The former army chief who seized power in a 2014 coup, said the intervention then had been necessary to restore order after six months of street protests and violent clashes, but things were getting back to normal after a March 24 election. “Thailand is now fully a democratic country with a constitutional monarchy, with a parliament whose members are elected,” Prayuth said. “All problems will be addressed normally based on a democratic system with no use of special powers,” he said, referring to sweeping powers the military government wielded. Last week, Prayuth used those powers for one last time to end various restrictions on media. He also transferred civilian legal cases from military to civilian court though he retained the power to let security forces carry out searches and make arrests unchallenged. King Maha Vajiralongkorn last week endorsed Prayuth’s new civilian cabinet, drawn from a 19-party coalition government that holds a slim majority in parliament. Thailand has seen intermittent bouts of political turmoil and violence - as well as two military coups - over the past 15 years as new political forces drawing support from the countryside have challenged the Bangkok-based military-royalist establishment. People are generally cautious about what the new set-up might bring. “We have to see their work first,” Noppawan Hiranpruk, 47, a market vendor told Reuters. “It’s OK to have old faces provided they have new ideas to make new things happen,” she said. The new government will officially take power after a swearing in ceremony on Tuesday. It is due to present its policies to parliament next week.

"70230793"|"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/ex-south-africa-president-jacob-zuma-tells-graft-probe-hes-a-victim-of-conspiracy/articleshow/70230793.cms"|"[AFP]"|"JOHANNESBURG: South Africa's former president Jacob Zuma on Monday dismissed multiple graft allegations against him, telling a judicial inquiry he was the victim of conspiracies, years of ""character assassination"" and plots to kill him. In an often rambling monologue, Zuma accused unnamed foreign intelligence agencies and spies of working against him and added: ""I have survived attempts to kill me."" Zuma testified at the inquiry in Johannesburg into the so-called ""state capture"" scandal after previous witnesses gave damning evidence against him. He is accused of overseeing mass looting of state assets during his nine-year tenure before being ousted by the ruling ANC party in 2018 and replaced by his deputy, Cyril Ramaphosa. ""I have been vilified, alleged to be the king of corrupt people,"" he said. ""I have been given every other name."" Zuma, who will face questioning by lawyers during an appearance that could last all week, said he had been the victim of ""character assassination over 20 years."" ""This commission, according to those who are implementing things, must be the grave of Zuma, he must be buried here,"" Zuma said. ""There has been a drive to remove me from the scene, (they) wish that I would disappear... there is this conspiracy against me."" Zuma, 77, was not legally required to attend the inquiry, but it invited him to appear after other witnesses testified against him. Led by judge Raymond Zondo, the probe is investigating a web of deals involving government officials, the wealthy Gupta family and state-owned companies. ""I never did any... breaking the law with this family -- never,"" he said. ""This commission from my understanding was really created to have me coming here and perhaps to find things on me,"" he alleged. Dismissing the term ""state capture"", he said it was impossible for one family to corrupt the government, parliament and the judiciary. ""It's an exaggeration, it is meant to enhance this narrative against Zuma,"" he said. ""There have been people sent from outside the country to come and kill me, but I have been patient not saying a thing — but I have been provoked to the last degree."" Sitting in central Johannesburg, the inquiry has heard from scores of witnesses over 130 days in session since last year. ""The commission is not mandated to prove any case against anybody but is mandated to investigate and inquire into certain allegations,"" judge Zondo said, thanking Zuma for appearing. Zondo asked Zuma's supporters in the venue not to applause his answers. According to Angelo Agrizzi, one of the inquiry's previous witnesses, Zuma allegedly accepted a monthly $2,200 bribe (1,951-euro) delivered in luxury bags from a contracting firm that was trying to evade police investigation. The money was in theory for his charity foundation. Agrizzi said his company also organised free parties, bulk alcohol supplies and birthday cakes to keep favour with Zuma's associates. Former finance minister Nhlanhla Nene, who was sacked by Zuma in 2015, testified that Zuma pushed policies on nuclear power and aviation designed to benefit the Gupta family. The Gupta brothers are accused of fraudulently profiting from government contracts including energy and transport deals under Zuma. The family owned a uranium mine, which would have seen profits soar from the nuclear deal, as well as a portfolio of mining, technology and media companies. They allegedly held such sway over Zuma that they were able to select some of his cabinet ministers. Former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas told the inquiry that the Guptas offered him the finance minister's job and even threatened to kill him after he refused to accept a $40 million bribe. Zuma has separately been charged with 16 counts of graft linked to an arms deal from before he became president. The Indian-born Gupta brothers — Ajay, Atul and Rajesh -- have left South Africa and are now based in Dubai. They also deny any wrong-doing. Eager to distance himself from the Zuma era, Ramaphosa has declared his presidency as a ""new dawn"" for the country and described the inquiry as a ""very painful process"".

The government has rounded up an estimated one million Uighurs and other mostly Muslim Turkic-speaking minorities into re-education camps in the tightly-controlled region in China's northwest, but it has also created a parallel universe for visitors, who are only shown a carefully curated version of traditional customs and culture. In the Old Town of Kashgar, an ancient Silk Road city, smiling food vendors serve mouthwatering lamb skewers, while children play in the streets. ""It didn't look to me like -- unless you were picked up and put in a camp -- that these Uighur communities seemed to be living in some kind of fear,"" said William Lee, who has taught at universities in China for 10 years and visited the region in June. ""That's just my impression,"" he added. Xinjiang, a fraught region where flare-ups of interethnic violence have led to unprecedented levels of surveillance, is one of the fastest growing areas for tourism in China. Armed police and frequent checkpoints have not dampened the flow of vacationers visiting the region, which in 2018 saw a 40 percent increase year-on-year of visits -- mainly from domestic tourists -- outstripping the national average by 25 percent, according to official figures. Business has grown steadily over the years mainly because ""Xinjiang is very stable"", explained Wu Yali, who runs a travel agency in the region. Though tourists are not used to the high-level of security at first, ""they adapt after a few days,"" she told AFP. But travellers are barred from witnessing the most controversial part of Xinjiang's security apparatus: the network of internment camps spread across the vast region. Many of these facilities are outside main tourist hubs and are fenced off with razor-wired walls. On a six-day trip to the region last month, AFP reporters encountered roadblocks and were turned away by security forces upon nearing some camps. China describes the facilities as ""vocational education centres"" where Turkic-speaking ""trainees"" learn Mandarin and job skills. ""The violence that is being inflicted on the bodies of Uighur and other Muslim people...has been rendered invisible,"" said Rachel Harris, who studies Uighur culture and music at the School of Oriental and African Studies University of London. ""For a tourist who goes and travels around a designated route, it all looks nice,"" she told AFP. ""It's all very quiet and that's because there's a regime of terror being imposed on the local people."" According to Communist Party mouthpiece People's Daily, the regional government offered travellers subsidies worth 500 yuan ($73) each in 2014, after tourism plunged following a deadly knife attack blamed on Xinjiang separatists in southwestern China. By 2020, Xinjiang is aiming to hit a total of 300 million visits by tourists and rake in 600 billion yuan ($ 87 billion), according to the region's tourism bureau. Tourism packages to Xinjiang often feature the region's rich array of natural beauty, from the azure waters of Karakul lake to Tianshan -- a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Many also offer ""ethnic"" experiences, often in the form of dance performances. Some tour operators even include visits to Uighur homes. Even as Chinese authorities seek to contain the region's Muslim minorities, they are monetising ethnic culture -- albeit a simplified version of it, experts say. ""Uighur culture is being boiled down to just song and dance,"" said Josh Summers, an American who lived in Xinjiang for more than a decade and wrote travel guides for the region. ""What makes me sad is what ends up happening is there are only very specific parts of Uighur culture that get maintained because of the tourism,"" he said, citing the neglect of Uighur paper-making traditions and desert shrines. Beijing's security clampdown has also squeezed Yengisar city's artisanal knife trade, said Summers. ""Ever since the management of Xinjiang became stricter, the impact on Yengisar's small knives has been very large -- now there are very few shops selling small knives,"" agreed Li Qingwen, who runs a tourism business in Xinjiang. The government wants Uighurs to ""show how they excel in singing and dancing, instead of living under religious rules and restrictions,"" he told AFP. But while ethnic song and dance is showcased to tourists, Uighurs are often restricted in how they express their own culture. Large, spontaneous gatherings of Uighurs -- even if they involve dancing -- are less frequent because of tightened security, said Summers. Night markets too are more controlled. In Hotan, what used to be an outdoor night market is now inside a white tent, where red lanterns hang from the ceiling and uniform food stalls adorned with Chinese flags sell lamb skewers, but also sushi and seafood. Over the past few years, cultural leaders in the Uighur community have disappeared, raising fears they have been detained. In February, Turkey's foreign ministry claimed that prominent Uighur musician and poet Abdurehim Heyit had died in a Chinese prison -- prompting China to release a ""proof-of-life"" video of an inmate who identified himself as Heyit. Famous Uighur comedian Adil Mijit is also missing, according to social media posts by his son-in-law Arslan Hidayat. And though tourists are buffered from the ugliest parts of Xinjiang's security crackdown, it is not difficult to bump against the region's many red lines.

US President Donald Trump's administration has said it is open to negotiations with Iran on a more far-reaching agreement on nuclear and security issues. But Iran has made any talks conditional on first being able to export as much oil as it did before the United States withdrew from the nuclear pact with world powers in May 2018. ""We have always believed in talks...if they lift sanctions, end the imposed economic pressure and return to the deal, we are ready to hold talks with America today, right now and anywhere,"" Rouhani said in his Sunday speech. In an interview with the Washington Post newspaper, Pompeo dismissed Rouhani's idea as ""the same offer that he offered to John F. Kerry and Barack Obama,"" referring to the former US secretary of state and president. ""President Trump will obviously make the final decision. But this is a path that the previous administration had gone down and it led to the (Iran nuclear deal) which this administration, President Trump and I both believe was a disaster,"" Pompeo said. Confrontations between Washington and Tehran have escalated, culminating in an aborted plan for US air strikes on Iran last month after Tehran downed a US drone. Trump called off the retaliatory US air strike at the last minute. Calling for dialogue among all to resume, France, Britain and Germany — parties to the 2015 pact — said on Sunday they were preoccupied by the escalation of tensions in the Gulf region and the risk the nuclear deal might fall apart. ""We believe that the time has come to act responsibly and to look for ways to stop the escalation of tension and resume dialogue,"" they said in a joint statement that was released by the French president's office. Despite calling for talks with Iranian leaders, Trump said on Wednesday that US sanctions on Iran would soon be increased ""substantially"". Existing US sanctions have targeted Iran's main foreign revenue stream from crude oil exports, which Trump in May moved to try to eliminate entirely. In reaction, Tehran said it would scale back its commitments under the deal, under which it had agreed to curb its nuclear program in return for relief from U.S. and other economic sanctions that had crippled its economy. 'Consider possible consequences' Defying a warning by the European parties to the pact to continue its full compliance, Tehran has amassed more low-enriched uranium than permitted and has started to enrich uranium above the 3.67% permitted by the agreement. ""The risks are such that it is necessary for all stakeholders to pause, and consider the possible consequences of their actions,"" France, Britain and Germany, which have been trying to salvage the pact by shielding Tehran's economy from sanctions, said in their statement. Iranian clerical rulers have said that Tehran will further decrease its commitments if Europeans fail to fulfil their promises to guarantee Iran's interests under the deal. The nuclear deal aimed to extend the amount of time it would theoretically take Iran to produce enough fissile material for an atomic bomb - so-called breakout time - from several months to a minimum of one year until 2025. Iran denies ever having considered developing atomic weapons. There have been two signs in the past week that the United States may be signalling greater openness to diplomacy. US officials told Reuters on Thursday that Washington had decided for now not to sanction Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif despite Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's June 24 statement he would be blacklisted that week. On Sunday, US officials said they had given Zarif a US visa to attend a UN meeting this week. Iran's mission to the United Nations said he had arrived in New York. Pompeo told the Washington Post he had granted the visa but restricted Zarif's movements while in New York, allowing him only to travel between UN headquarters and the Iranian mission six blocks away, and to the residence of Iran's UN ambassador. Pompeo declined comment when asked whether he or other US officials would try to speak with Zarif this week or at the UN General Assembly in September, the Washington Post reported. While accusing Zarif of exploiting US freedom of the press to ""spread malign propaganda,"" the US secretary of state told the newspaper he would accept any offer to appear on Iranian television.

With every step, she risks harassment or even arrest by Iran's morality police whose job it is to enforce the strict dress code imposed after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. ""I have to confess it is really, really scary,"" the 30-year-old fire-safety consultant said in a WhatsApp audio message, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions. But she is also hopeful, saying she believes the authorities find it increasingly difficult to suppress protests as more women join in. ""They are running after us, but cannot catch us,"" she said. ""This is why we believe change is going to be made."" The hijab debate has further polarized Iranians at a time when the country is buckling under unprecedented US sanctions imposed since the Trump administration pulled out of a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers last year. It's unclear to what extent the government can enforce hijab compliance amid an economic malaise, including a currency collapse and rising housing prices. There's anecdotal evidence that more women are pushing back against the dress code, trying to redefine red lines as they test the response of the ruling Shiite Muslim clergy and their security agencies. An Associated Press reporter spotted about two dozen women in the streets without a hijab over the course of nine days, mainly in well-to-do areas of Tehran — a mall, a lakeside park, a hotel lobby. Many other women, while stopping short of outright defiance, opted for loosely draped colorful scarves that show as much hair as they cover. Even in Tehran's Grand Bazaar, frequented by many traditional women, most female shoppers wore these casual hijabs. Still, a sizeable minority of women was covered head-to-toe in black robes and tightly pulled headscarves, the so-called chador. The struggle against compulsory headscarves first made headlines in December 2017 when a woman climbed atop a utility box in Tehran's Revolution Street, waving her hijab on a stick. More than three dozen protesters have been detained since, including nine who are currently in detention, said Masih Alinejad, an Iranian activist who now lives in New York. Despite attempts to silence protesters, public debate has intensified, amplified by social media. Last month, a widely watched online video showed a security agent grab an unveiled teenage girl and violently push her into the back of a police car, prompting widespread criticism. President Hassan Rouhani and Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have supported a softer attitude toward women who don't comply with the official dress code. However, hard-liners opposed to such easing have become more influential as the nuclear deal is faltering. They have called for harsh punishment, even lashes, arguing that allowing women to show their hair leads to moral decay and the disintegration of families. The judiciary recently urged Iranians to inform on women without hijabs by sending photos and videos to designated social media accounts. ""The more women dress in an openly sexual way, the less we'll have social peace, while facing a higher crime rate,"" Minoo Aslani, head of the women's branch of the paramilitary Basij group, told a rally last week. Another gathering was attended by several thousand women in chadors. One held up a sign reading, ""The voluntary hijab is a plot by the enemy."" Reformist lawmaker Parvaneh Salahshouri said coercion does not work. ""What we see is that the morality police have been a failure,"" said Salahshouri, who wears a headscarf out of religious belief. Changing hijab rules through legislation is unlikely because of the constraints on parliament, she said. Instead, women should engage in non-violent civil disobedience, Salahshouri said. She cautioned that it's a slow, difficult road, but that ""Iranian women have not given up their efforts."" The hijab controversy goes back to the mid-1930s when police forced women to take off their hijabs, part of a Westernization policy by then-Shah Reza Pahlavi. Under his son and successor, women could choose. Western apparel was common among the elite. A 2018 survey by a parliament research center indicates that most women wear a casual hijab and only 13% opt for a chador. Attitudes have changed. In 1980, two-thirds believed women should wear hijabs. Today, fewer than 45% approve of government intervention in the issue, the research said. Iran has seen waves of anti-government protests, including an outcry after a 2009 election many contended was stolen by hard-liners. Those with economic grievances frequently protest. Alinejad, the activist, argued the campaign against forced hijabs carries symbolic weight, saying that mandatory headscarves were ""the symbol that the Iranian government used to take the whole society hostage."" In recent years, she has posted videos and photos of activists, including of women filming themselves as they walk in the streets without a headscarf. Alinejad said she receives more than 20 images a day, but posts only some. The activists in Iran take risks. In March, human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh, who has represented female protesters, was sentenced to 38.5 years in prison, of which she must serve 12, according to her husband. In April, activists Yasaman Aryani, her mother Monireh Arabshahi and Mojgan Keshavarz were arrested after posting a video showing them without headscarves in the Tehran metro. In the video, they distributed flowers to female passengers and spoke of a day when women have the freedom to choose. Others have pushed boundaries more gradually. The 30-year-old fire-safety consultant said she tries to avoid policemen when she walks the streets without a hijab. She said she grudgingly complies with the dress code when she delivers lectures or sings in a mixed choir — activities she would otherwise be barred from. At the high-end Palladium Mall in northern Tehran, several shoppers casually ignored a sign reminding customers that the hijab is mandatory. One woman only pulled up her scarf, which was draped around her shoulders, when she stepped into an elevator and found herself next to a security guard. Nearby, 20-year-old Paniz Masoumi sat on the stone steps of a plaza. She had dyed some of her hair blue, but kept that funky patch hidden under a loose scarf. She said police recently impounded her car for two weeks, fining her amid claims that a traffic camera snapped her with a below-standard hijab. If hijabs were voluntary, she'd throw off hers, Masoumi said. But for now, ""I am not looking for trouble.""

China's carbon emissions data is notoriously opaque, but as a signatory to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Beijing is obliged to submit an official inventory to the UN on a regular basis. It has previously released figures for 2005 and 2010. As the world's biggest greenhouse gas producer, China is aiming to bring its total emissions to a peak by ""around 2030"", though it has also pledged to show ""the highest possible ambition"" when it reviews its targets next year. The 2014 figure, based on the most recent calculations by the Chinese government, includes China's emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, but does not make adjustments based on changes in land use or increases in forest coverage. The environment ministry said if the impact of forests and other ""carbon sinks"" were taken into consideration, total emissions would have stood at 11.186 billion tonnes in 2014, still up 17% from 2010. Total net US emissions were measured at 5.74 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2017, down 0.5% on the year, according to the country's Environmental Protection Agency. A study published by the Nature Geoscience journal last year estimated that China's total emissions hit a record 9.53 billion tonnes in 2013 and then declined over the following three years. The decline in CO2 from 2014-2016 came as a result of falling energy consumption, but it has since rebounded. Record production levels in carbon-intensive sectors such as steel could mean CO2 emissions are still on the rise and could hit fresh records this year, environmental group Greenpeace said.

The government has rounded up an estimated one million Uighurs and other mostly Muslim Turkic-speaking minorities into re-education camps in the tightly-controlled region in China's northwest, but it has also created a parallel universe for visitors, who are only shown a carefully curated version of traditional customs and culture. In the Old Town of Kashgar, an ancient Silk Road city, smiling food vendors serve mouthwatering lamb skewers, while children play in the streets. ""It didn't look to me like — unless you were picked up and put in a camp — that these Uighur communities seemed to be living in some kind of fear,"" said William Lee, who has taught at universities in China for 10 years and visited the region in June. ""That's just my impression,"" he added. Xinjiang, a fraught region where flare-ups of interethnic violence have led to unprecedented levels of surveillance, is one of the fastest growing areas for tourism in China. Armed police and frequent checkpoints have not dampened the flow of vacationers visiting the region, which in 2018 saw a 40 percent increase year-on-year of visits — mainly from domestic tourists — outstripping the national average by 25 percent, according to official figures. Business has grown steadily over the years mainly because ""Xinjiang is very stable"", explained Wu Yali, who runs a travel agency in the region. Though tourists are not used to the high-level of security at first, ""they adapt after a few days,"" she told AFP. But travellers are barred from witnessing the most controversial part of Xinjiang's security apparatus: the network of internment camps spread across the vast region. Many of these facilities are outside main tourist hubs and are fenced off with razor-wired walls. On a six-day trip to the region last month, AFP reporters encountered roadblocks and were turned away by security forces upon nearing some camps. China describes the facilities as ""vocational education centres"" where Turkic-speaking ""trainees"" learn Mandarin and job skills. ""The violence that is being inflicted on the bodies of Uighur and other Muslim people...has been rendered invisible,"" said Rachel Harris, who studies Uighur culture and music at the School of Oriental and African Studies University of London. ""For a tourist who goes and travels around a designated route, it all looks nice,"" she told AFP. ""It's all very quiet and that's because there's a regime of terror being imposed on the local people."" According to Communist Party mouthpiece People's Daily, the regional government offered travellers subsidies worth 500 yuan ($73) each in 2014, after tourism plunged following a deadly knife attack blamed on Xinjiang separatists in southwestern China. By 2020, Xinjiang is aiming to hit a total of 300 million visits by tourists and rake in 600 billion yuan ($87 billion), according to the region's tourism bureau. Tourism packages to Xinjiang often feature the region's rich array of natural beauty, from the azure waters of Karakul lake to Tianshan — a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Many also offer ""ethnic"" experiences, often in the form of dance performances. Some tour operators even include visits to Uighur homes. Even as Chinese authorities seek to contain the region's Muslim minorities, they are monetising ethnic culture — albeit a simplified version of it, experts say. ""Uighur culture is being boiled down to just song and dance,"" said Josh Summers, an American who lived in Xinjiang for more than a decade and wrote travel guides for the region. ""What makes me sad is what ends up happening is there are only very specific parts of Uighur culture that get maintained because of the tourism,"" he said, citing the neglect of Uighur paper-making traditions and desert shrines. Beijing's security clampdown has also squeezed Yengisar city's artisanal knife trade, said Summers. ""Ever since the management of Xinjiang became stricter, the impact on Yengisar's small knives has been very large — now there are very few shops selling small knives,"" agreed Li Qingwen, who runs a tourism business in Xinjiang. The government wants Uighurs to ""show how they excel in singing and dancing, instead of living under religious rules and restrictions,"" he told AFP. But while ethnic song and dance is showcased to tourists, Uighurs are often restricted in how they express their own culture. Large, spontaneous gatherings of Uighurs — even if they involve dancing — are less frequent because of tightened security, said Summers. Night markets too are more controlled. In Hotan, what used to be an outdoor night market is now inside a white tent, where red lanterns hang from the ceiling and uniform food stalls adorned with Chinese flags sell lamb skewers, but also sushi and seafood. Over the past few years, cultural leaders in the Uighur community have disappeared, raising fears they have been detained. In February, Turkey's foreign ministry claimed that prominent Uighur musician and poet Abdurehim Heyit had died in a Chinese prison — prompting China to release a ""proof-of-life"" video of an inmate who identified himself as Heyit. Famous Uighur comedian Adil Mijit is also missing, according to social media posts by his son-in-law Arslan Hidayat. And though tourists are buffered from the ugliest parts of Xinjiang's security crackdown, it is not difficult to bump against the region's many red lines. A traveller from Southeast Asia, who requested anonymity due to fear of reprisals, described the barriers he faced when trying to pray at a mosque. Many places of worship were closed in Kashgar, he said, unlike mosques in other Chinese cities. At Idkah Mosque, Kashgar's central mosque, the tourist was told he couldn't pray inside — and that he had to buy a ticket to enter. ""They want to separate travellers from locals,"" he said, adding that his visit to Xinjiang confirmed what he had read about re-education camps. He added: ""There's a lot more of Xinjiang that I want to discover. But I really hope that Xinjiang will become the old Xinjiang.""

Nearly 250 people were killed — excluding the coup-plotters — and over 2,000 were injured after a rogue military faction tried to wrest power from the president, but thousands took to the streets in response to Erdogan's call to defeat the uprising. The anniversary comes at a difficult moment for Erdogan, faced with a weakened economy, worsening relations with NATO ally the United States, and a loss for his party in the recent Istanbul local election to a more unified opposition. After laying flowers at a monument for coup victims at his presidential palace complex in Ankara, Erdogan took part in a tense ceremony at parliament, which was bombed during the attempted putsch. He was scheduled later to give a speech in Istanbul and inaugurate a museum dedicated to the failed coup of July 15, 2016. Erdogan's spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said on Twitter that Turkey ""sends a powerful message of unity and solidarity to the world: We will die but never let traitors and putschists destroy our country, our freedom and our dignity."" The day, known as ""15 July"" in Turkey, has become a national holiday. Relations with the West deteriorated after the coup bid, with Turkish officials accusing the West of not giving Ankara sufficient support. At the same time, Erdogan has grown ever closer to Russian President Vladimir Putin, raising concerns in Europe and the United States. Adding to the tension, Ankara has bought Russia's S-400 missile defence system, and has drilled for gas and oil off Cyprus despite EU warnings. Ankara accuses former ally-turned-foe Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim cleric exiled in the United States, of having ordered the attempted coup and lists his movement as a ""terrorist"" organisation. Some 8,000 military personnel took part in the bid to overthrow Erdogan, backed by 35 fighter jets, three boats, 37 helicopters and 74 tanks, according to state news agency Anadolu. Since 2016, tens of thousands of people have been detained while 150,000 public sector employees have been suspended or sacked over alleged links to Gulen. Anadolu reported Sunday that 110 suspected Gulen movement members have been extradited to Turkey from more than 20 countries.

India's participation or voice has been negligible in the evolving situation, while Pakistan has used the opportunity to manoeuvre itself to centerstage of the region's geopolitics. Shaida Abdali, former Afghan ambassador to India and a presidential candidate, told TOI here last week, ""India's 18-year-old effort to strengthen ties with Afghanistan should not be lost at this juncture. India's indifference to the evolving situation in Afghanistan will likely cost it in the long run."" India is nowhere in the peace negotiations, nor have India's concerns really found any traction. In the latest blow to India, US ambassador to Afghanistan, John Bass, on Thursday said that Afghanistan's presidential elections, scheduled for September 28, could be postponed, until the peace process with the Taliban was completed. India is opposed to this - during US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo's visit to New Delhi , NSA Ajit Doval repeatedly stressed the importance of holding elections in Afghanistan on schedule even if the peace process was on. India also opposed the proposal to have an interim government in Afghanistan, both with US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and with Russia. None of India's concerns cut much ice with any of the principal stakeholders in Afghanistan. Last week, the US and the Taliban hammered out a provisional 8-point agreement (although in the Pashto version it includes 10 points). Despite Khalilzad saying the US won't ""cut and run"" and that it was ""not a withdrawal agreement but a peace agreement"" the Taliban and others have interpreted the agreement as the former. The process has gathered momentum, despite almost daily terror attacks by the Taliban. India's 18-year investment in Afghanistan has been largely with the government of the day. India remains the most popular country in Afghanistan with the people. Amar Sinha, former Indian ambassador to Afghanistan and member, NSAB said, ""India should be more proactive. It is in a good place as far as the nationalist Afghans are concerned. India should bring them together at this time, so they can speak unitedly. We're distressed to see the level of disunity among the political leaders in Afghanistan."" Abdali said, ""One of the most critical gains post 2001 is our democratic process -- which must not be affected without full international guarantees that Afghanistan will not reverse to pre-2001 dark era. It is necessary that India remain engaged … as a trusted country versus a disruptive one. In this uncertainty, with no viable solution in sight, India must stay engaged."" The US has succeeded in bringing Russia and China on the same page, and last week they included Pakistan, Taliban's principal sponsor. Pakistan is playing a crucial role of bringing the Taliban to the table and keeping them there. On July 12, the four countries met in Beijing to issue a 'four-party joint statement on the Afghan peace process. The statement ""welcomed recent positive progress as the crucial parties concerned have advanced their talks and increased contacts with each other. All sides also welcomed intra-Afghan meetings held in Moscow and Doha. … The four sides encouraged all parties to take steps to reduce violence leading to a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire that starts with intra-Afghan negotiations."" The Doha agreement of July 7-8 between the US and Taliban includes the agreements reached in Moscow, thereby taking care of Russia's interests. China and Pakistan look out for each other. India is out of the picture, despite having vital security interests. Interestingly, former Afghan president Hamid Karzai, believed to be close to India, became a facilitator of the Taliban talks both in Moscow and in Beijing. Meanwhile, Afghanistan's elected government has been under concerted pressure. First, the Taliban has refused to countenance them as a credible party, to the extent that the ""intra-Afghan"" talks included people from the government in their personal capacities. Second, Taliban attacks in the past weeks and months have been relentless. Third, neither US, Russia, China or Pakistan have given the government any place at the talks. Fourth, with no certainty of elections, the government is looking at extinction. Fifth, Pakistan's airspace ban has cut off Afghanistan from India, imposing economic costs, and making a political point of the indispensability of Pakistan. Khalilzad declared he has achieved progress on four fronts: assurances from the Taliban that Afghanistan will not become a staging ground again for militant groups like al-Qaida or the Islamic State; withdrawal of US troops; all-Afghan dialogue to reach agreement on a peaceful future; and a permanent ceasefire. The US goal is to complete peace talks with the Taliban by September 1, which would begin the withdrawal of US and Nato troops. In five months after that, the Taliban and other Afghans are expected to come to an agreement. Pakistan finds itself in a much happier position. Having proved their indispensability, Pakistan has been a recipient of aid from US's principal allies Saudi Arabia, UAE and Qatar, as well as an IMF bailout. China remains Pakistan's principal ally and benefactor, but the US, despite Trump's mean tweets about Pakistan, is getting ready to fete Imran Khan in Washington next week.

His message was immediately seized upon by Democrats, who called it a racist trope. “So interesting to see ‘Progressive’ Democrat Congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world (if they even have a functioning government at all), now loudly and viciously telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful Nation on earth, how our government is to be run,” Trump posted on Twitter. He added: “Why don’t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how it is done.” Trump’s attack was meant for members of the so-called squad, a group engaged in an existential and generational war of words with Pelosi: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts. “These places need your help badly, you can’t leave fast enough,” Trump said. “I’m sure that Nancy Pelosi would be very happy to quickly work out free travel arrangements!” Only one of the women, Omar, who is from Somalia, was born outside the US. Ocasio-Cortez was born in the Bronx to parents of Puerto Rican descent. Pressley, who is black, was born in Cincinnati and raised in Chicago. And Tlaib was born in Detroit to Palestinian immigrants. Trump’s attack came after days of Fox News coverage that centred on Omar. During her tenure in Congress, Omar has rattled fellow Democrats and provided ammunition to Republicans for her repeated criticisms of Israel. And she has been vocal about her life as a refugee who fled her native country and eventually settled in US, only to be disappointed with the country she found. More than any of the others in her freshman group, Omar — one of the first two Muslim women in Congress along with Tlaib — has used her personal story to make the argument that loving America does not require an acceptance of its shortcomings. Several Democrat leaders chided Trump for what they called a racially motivated message. Pelosi condemned Trump’s remarks as “xenophobic” in tweets of her own, turning them around to criticise Trump’s immigration policies and project Democratic unity. “Our diversity is our strength and our unity is our power,” she wrote of Democrats. Representative Ben Ray Lujan said Trump would do better to spend his time on the humanitarian crisis at the southern border and to address other pressing national concerns like prescription drug costs than attacking members of Congress. “That is a racist tweet,” Lujan said on “Fox News Sunday.” Representative Brendan F Boyle, Democrat of Pennsylvania, made the point that he is from an immigrant family, but had never come under racially charged criticism from the president. He is white. “Like some of my Democratic colleagues, I’m young, from an immigrant family, also very critical of Trump,” Boyle posted on Twitter. “Funny thing though, he never tells me to ‘go back where I come from.’ Hmm I wonder why?” Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."|"Trump tells Dem congresswomen to ‘go back’ to ‘fix’ countries they came from"|"Mon Jul 15 06:08:00 CEST 2019"|"[world]"

Demonstrators in dozens of cities protested the planned raids, and local and state officials called for restraint, but to no effect. Before dawn on Sunday, agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) are expected to hit the streets of at least 10 major American cities with plans to arrest some 2,000 undocumented migrants who entered the United States recently. The scope of the operation appears far more modest than the ""millions"" Trump had promised would be detained and expelled when he first mentioned the raids -- and subsequently postponed — last month. But that has not eased the anguish felt by those who fear they might be targeted. Adding to their concerns are media reports that ICE agents are prepared to scoop up not just those targeted by removal orders but also other undocumented migrants that agents may come upon incidentally. That, potentially, could include some migrants who have been in the country for years, with homes, jobs and children who are US citizens. ""This uncertainty, this fear, is wreaking havoc,"" Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said on CNN. ""It's traumatizing people."" Trump insisted on Friday that ""most mayors"" want the raids. ""Most mayors do. You know why? They don't want to have crimes in their cities,"" he said, repeating his frequent -- and incorrect -- assertion that migrants are more likely to be criminals than native-born Americans. Several mayors have expressed concern about the federal operation. Miami Mayor Francis Suarez pointed out that in 2018, his first year in office, his Florida city experienced its ""lowest homicide rate in 51 years -- so I don't understand the rationale for choosing Miami."" ""It doesn't make it easier for us, as mayors, to keep our citizens and those who are in our city ... quiet and calm."" Some city officials, as well as pro-migrant and civil rights groups, have sought to educate those who might be targeted on their rights in the event of a raid. ""We're asking people, if you are in fear of deportation, to stay in on Sunday, to travel in groups,"" Atlanta Mayor Keisha Bottoms said on CNN. If ""someone comes to your door, please don't open the door unless they have a warrant."" New York Mayor Bill de Blasio told MSNBC he sees the raids as ""a political act to convince a lot of people in America that immigrants are the problem."" Like many other city officials, he fears the aggressive roundup could intimidate migrants, making them less likely in future to cooperate with local police, thus making it harder to ensure public safety. ""We have millions of people standing in line waiting to become citizens of this country,"" Trump said Friday. He said it would be unfair to them if others could simply cross the border in an attempt to gain the privileges of American life. But the impending raids have raised concerns about how a new influx could affect federal detention centers already badly overcrowded. The United States has been struggling for more than a year with a migration crisis on its southern border, as thousands of people stream into the US each month, mostly from Central American countries riven by violence and poverty. The number of undocumented arrivals totaled more than 100,000 last month -- down 28 percent from May but still at a ""critical"" level, according to the Department of Homeland Security. On Friday and Saturday, dozens of protests were organized across the country by groups demanding the closing of overcrowded detention centers and opposing the planned raids. Several American news outlets have reported on centers holding young children, separated from their parents, in crowded and unhygienic conditions. US officials have acknowledged the overcrowding but insisted they are doing their best to provide decent conditions. Some reports Saturday suggested that ICE might have to requisition hotel rooms to accommodate those detained in the upcoming raids. A major hotel chain, Marriott International, was asked by AFP whether it had been contacted by the government. It said it had not yet been contacted, but added, ""Marriott has made the decision to decline any requests to use our hotels as detention facilities.""

After briefly becoming the first hurricane of the Atlantic season, Barry was downgraded to a tropical storm after making landfall — but it nevertheless packed a serious punch as it moved inland. All flights in and out of the airport in the state's biggest city New Orleans were cancelled, thousands had evacuated their homes, tens of thousands had lost power and first responders were poised for action. Fears that the levee system in New Orleans could be compromised had eased after the Army Corps of Engineers voiced confidence that it would hold, but Mayor LaToya Cantrell urged residents not to be complacent. ""We are not in any way out of the woods,"" she said, adding that flash flooding could still occur into Sunday. Louisiana governor John Bel Edwards said the storm would intensify into Sunday, with many areas seeing more rain overnight than they had during the day. ""Don't let your guard down thinking the worst is behind us,"" he told a press conference. At 10pm (0300 GMT), the storm was packing winds of 50 miles (85 kilometers) per hour, the National Hurricane Center said, and was located southwest of the city of Alexandria, moving north-northwest at eight mph. ""Barry is still very much a dangerous storm with impacts only increasing through Sunday,"" the National Weather Service said in a tweet. The storm was expected to chug north across inland Louisiana into Sunday, while tornado warnings were issued for areas of New Orleans and parts of the neighboring state of Mississippi. Rainfall estimates had been lowered to between eight and 15 inches (20 to 38 centimeters) but an AFP journalist said rivers and canals across South Louisiana were full. The heavy winds had scattered tree branches across roads and knocked over road signs, and in St. John's Parish next to New Orleans, local television footage showed some areas under two or more feet (60 centimeters) of water. The eye of the storm made landfall at Intracoastal City, a speck of a town with a few houses and businesses. Part of the main road was flooded Saturday afternoon, as were some waterfront businesses, with water rising by the minute. News footage showed localized flooding, swollen waterways, and downed power lines and trees across south Louisiana as rivers overtopped their levees in several locations, including part of coastal Terrebonne Parish where authorities had issued a mandatory evacuation notice. The Atchafalaya River had swallowed the waterfront pedestrian promenade in Morgan City, which was entirely without power, as about 10 members of America's Cajun Navy citizen rescue group assembled under a highway overpass. ""We're just neighbors helping neighbors,"" John Billiot, 39, the group's president, told AFP. They have been conducting volunteer rescues since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and were equipped with five flat-bottom rescue boats, a high-clearance, military-style truck and 86 boats staged in the region in preparation for the latest storm. ""We're still waiting. Barry is playing peek-a-boo with us,"" Billiot said. For many, the storm and potential for large-scale flooding revived unpleasant memories of deadly Hurricane Katrina. Thousands have packed up and left their homes as floodwaters hit low-lying areas like Plaquemines Parish, where road closures left some communities isolated. Others hunkered down to ride out the squall, despite mandatory evacuation orders and the risk of dangerous storm surges. ""Category one, I'd say, is not much to worry about. A one? That's a thunderstorm. I'll be back to work Monday,"" William Manuel, a maintenance worker living in Bayou Vista, not far from Morgan City, told AFP. Louisiana is facing an extraordinarily dangerous confluence of conditions, experts say. The level of the Mississippi River, already swollen from historic rains and flooding upstream, was at nearly 17 feet (5.2 meters) in New Orleans — just below flood stage. However, Edwards said new forecasts show many rivers wouldn't reach their maximum height predicted before the storm hit, though flash floods remained a threat. US Senator Bill Cassidy said officials with the Army Corps of Engineers told him they were ""confident"" that the 20-foot-high levee system protecting New Orleans, a city of 400,000, would hold. ""There's still going to be two to three feet between the top of the levee and the top of the floodwaters,"" Cassidy told Fox News. In 2005, Katrina — the costliest and deadliest hurricane in recent US history -- submerged about 80 percent of New Orleans after the city's levee system failed, causing some 1,800 deaths and more than $150 billion in damage.

""The administration is set upon an act of diplomatic vandalism, seemingly for ideological and personality reasons- it was Obama's deal,"" ambassador Kim Darroch wrote in a diplomatic cable in May 2018. The cable was included in a second batch of leaked reports published by the Mail on Sunday newspaper, the first of which caused Darroch to resign earlier this week. In May 2018, Britain's then-foreign minister Boris Johnson went to Washington to try to persuade Trump not to abandon the Iran deal. In a cable sent afterwards, Darroch indicated there were divisions in Trump's team over the decision, and criticised the White House for a lack of long-term strategy. ""They can't articulate any 'day-after' strategy; and contacts with State Department this morning suggest no sort of plan for reaching out to partners and allies, whether in Europe or the region,"" Darroch wrote. He reported back that secretary of state Mike Pompeo, during his talks with Johnson, ""did some subtle distancing by talking throughout about 'the President's decision'"". The newspaper reported that, according to Darroch, Pompeo also hinted that he had tried but failed to ""sell"" a revised text to Trump. In 2015, the United States, China, Britain, France, Russia and Germany signed a deal with Iran to limit its nuclear programme in exchange for a partial lifting of international economic sanctions. Trump had long been critical of the deal and withdrew the United States on May 8, 2018. A first batch of leaked reports authored by Darroch last weekend caused major turmoil between Britain and its closest ally. Darroch was reported to have described the White House as ""inept"", prompting Trump to claim the ambassador was a ""pompous fool"" whom he would no longer deal with. The ambassador resigned on Wednesday, saying it was now ""impossible"" to do his job. The British government has launched an investigation into the leaks, while police are also looking into a potential breach of the Official Secrets Act. London's Metropolitan Police sparked widespread condemnation on Saturday after a warning to journalists that publishing leaked documents could be a criminal matter. Johnson, who is now in the race to succeed May as prime minister, said that prosecuting media outlets would have a ""chilling effect on public debate"".

After issuing a warning, police on Saturday moved forward to disperse the crowd of mostly young protesters who say peaceful demonstrations have failed to bring about change. Police used pepper spray and batons. In panicky scenes, fleeing protesters scrambled over each other, some falling to the ground. Some had donned protective masks and helmets ahead of the confrontation. Major demonstrations in the past month against a proposal to change extradition laws that would allow Hong Kong suspects to stand trial in mainland China have reawakened other movements in the city. Thousands marched last weekend against middle-aged mainland women who sing loudly and dance somewhat provocatively in a public park. The protests have a common refrain: Hong Kong's government, led by a non-democratically elected chief executive, is not addressing the people's concerns. Another rally is planned for Sunday. Walking behind a banner that read ""Strictly enforce the law, stop cross-border traders,"" Saturday's marchers passed by pharmacies and cosmetic shops that are popular with Chinese tourists and traders who bring goods back to sell in the mainland. Many of the stores were shuttered because of the protest. Amy Chan, a 25-year-old bank employee, called the protest a continuing action building on the momentum of the anti-extradition law rallies. ""There isn't an anti-extradition protest every day to keep us going,"" she said. ""I hope that through today's action, people in Hong Kong will not forget that there are actually many other social issues waiting to be solved."" The city's leader, Carrie Lam, has pledged to do a better job of listening to all sectors of society, but many protesters want her to resign. Her government proposed legislation in February that would have allowed suspects to be extradited to China. The proposal ignited concerns that the rights and freedoms guaranteed to the former British colony for 50 years after its 1997 return to China are being chipped away at by a pro-Beijing government in Hong Kong. Lam suspended the legislation indefinitely after protesters blocked the legislature on June 12, preventing the Legislative Council from meeting to debate the extradition bill. Faced with continuing protests, she declared the bill ""dead"" on Tuesday, but protesters remain unsatisfied, demanding it is formally withdrawn. The march Saturday took place in Sheung Shui, a district that lies across the border from the mainland city of Shenzhen. Organiser Ronald Leung, a leader of the North District Parallel Imports Concern Group, said residents have been complaining about the issue of Chinese traders for many years.

""It's like a puzzle,"" says forensic specialist Mohammad Ihsan from behind a medical mask, as he lays out yellowed bones under fluorescent lights at the shabby Medico-Legal Directorate in eastern Baghdad. The bones, recently exhumed from mass graves in the Yazidi stronghold of Sinjar in northwest Iraq, will be compared with blood samples from surviving members of the community to help determine the fates of those still missing after IS's 2014 rampage through their villages. Entire families were massacred, boys forcibly recruited to fight and women and girls pushed into ""sex slavery"" in what the United Nations has said could amount to ""genocide"". Five years on, a joint criminal investigation is seeking to bring legal and emotional closure to the ethno-religious minority. But the high-profile probe has been complicated by weathered evidence and the difficulty of building a genetic database for a community as insular as the Yazidis, where the search for DNA may take scientists as far as Australia. Since March, the bones, hair and personal belongings from 12 grave sites in Sinjar have been brought to Ihsan's lab, which builds an initial biological profile of the victim including height and gender. ""Our trauma specialists determine the cause of death, the fractures and injuries,"" he adds. Specialists then try to identify victims through their DNA, best preserved in the femur and teeth. These items are ground into a fine powder and run through machines to match them with blood samples drawn from Yazidi survivors and dripped onto a piece of paper. ""The newer the body you're testing, the better you can extract the DNA,"" says genetics analyst Mais Nabil. But the graves in Sinjar were packed with bodies and exposed to floods, fires and fighting over five years, making the samples less than ideal. ""Sometimes, we're getting samples that are very deteriorated, and we can only try a few times to extract the DNA before it is no longer usable,"" Nabil tells AFP. Then comes the identification process. The Yazidi community numbered 550,000 in northwestern Iraq before 2014, but IS's rampage forced 100,000 to flee abroad and several times that number into displacement camps. Mass violence against a minority often means there are more victims than survivors in each family, and the rate of intermarriage among Yazidis is so high that DNA samples do not necessarily provide a definitive profile. ""There are families that were completely wiped out. Who would register the missing person's name in that case?"" says Amer Hammoud, associate director at the Medico-Legal Directorate. His facility has logged the names of 1,280 missing individuals, is storing 1,050 blood sample cards, and is awaiting another 2,600 samples from Kurdish authorities. But the real trove of evidence is abroad. ""There are 2,200 Yazidi families in Germany that I aspire to reach so I can get DNA samples to match. There are 800 families in Australia, 800 in Canada and nearly 150 in France. This list would be bigger than the samples we have here in Iraq,"" says Hammoud. Just 10 years old, his facility has been examining victims of decades of violence in Iraq. The cardboard boxes containing evidence from Sinjar are surrounded by identical cartons labelled ""Anfal,"" ""Karrada,"" and ""Basra,"" -- respectively storing evidence from a massacre of Kurds in the 1980s, a 2016 explosion in Baghdad and a province hit by the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s. ""We've had years of experience identifying victims. But to minimise the margin of error here, we need time,"" he says. The exhumation and identification efforts are supported by the UN special probe into IS crimes (UNITAD), which is gathering evidence and witness testimony for eventual trials in ""national courts"", perhaps including Iraq. Those cases could take years to put together, but Bashar Hamad is desperate for an answer much sooner. Hamad, 51, last saw his brother Nawaf in 2014 as they clambered up Mount Sinjar to flee approaching IS fighters. Nawaf set off to a nearby village to scavenge for food, but jihadists captured him and five other relatives and they were never seen again. ""There's no more Daesh (IS), and in the Al-Hol camp (housing people who once lived under IS), there are only women and children. No men,"" he says. Hamad and his family, who remain displaced in northwest Iraq, provided blood samples to authorities last year but have little hope of finding Nawaf alive. ""We will never be at ease.

The decision is unusual for Trump, who has pointed to national security concerns in calling for restrictions on foreign metal and autos in trade negotiations. It's also drawing rare criticism from Republicans in energy-rich states. Uranium is a vital component for the US nuclear arsenal, submarines and power plants, which prompted a monthslong Commerce Department investigation into whether such materials fall under the national security umbrella. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has said that just 5 per cent of the uranium the US needs for military and electricity generation comes from domestic production. Russia, China and other countries supply the rest. In a statement issued late Friday, Trump said Ross's findings of national security ""raise significant concerns."" Yet the president opted against quotas as advocated by the domestic uranium industry, which would limit imports to guarantee that US miners supply 25 per cent of uranium for domestic use. Trump instead announced he was going to order a working group to use 90 days to make recommendations to increase domestic uranium production. Two Colorado-based uranium mining companies - Energy Fuels Inc. and Ur-Energy Inc. - petitioned the Commerce Department in January 2018 to impose the 25 per cent requirement under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. The companies said relying on imports poses a ""serious threat to our national defence and energy security."" Much of the uranium mined in the U.S. comes from Wyoming. ""The decision by the Trump administration is a missed opportunity to protect America's uranium producers,"" said Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., who denounced using foreign materials. ""America should not rely on Vladimir Putin and his satellites to supply our uranium. It's dangerous and unacceptable."" Environmentalists saw the mining companies' petition as part of an effort to expand mining across the U.S. They also were worried about the area outside the boundary of Grand Canyon National Park, where an Obama-era decision placed roughly 1 million acres off-limits to new mining claims for a 20-year period. ""We're obviously relieved there's not a quota, but we're not out of the woods yet,"" said Amber Reimondo, energy program director for the Flagstaff, Arizona-based environmental group the Grand Canyon Trust. ""There's clearly some concern with this working group that the president has ordered. And, depending on what comes out of that, it seems likely that there could be additional shortcuts to environmental safeguards."" Last month, the Trump administration designated nearly three dozen minerals, including uranium, as critical. Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said at the time the department would work ""expeditiously"" to streamline the permitting process for mining to locate domestic supplies of minerals. Energy Fuels has been waiting for uranium prices to rise to restart operations at its Canyon Mine near the Grand Canyon's South Rim entrance. In a statement, the energy companies said they ""commend"" Trump for recognizing that the nuclear industry was ""under siege"" and for establishing the working group. The decision was a rare moment in which the Trump administration did not use the powers of the government to give American companies a trade advantage over international competition. The administration had previously levied tariffs on foreign steel and aluminium, leading to retaliatory tariffs from Canada, Mexico, China and Europe.

The decision emerged from a meeting of the national committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), which met to discuss the management of temples and churches in the country, official Xinhua news agency said. The meeting was led by Wang Yang, a member of the most powerful standing committee of the political bureau of the Communist Party. He also called for efforts “to improve and make innovations in the management of temples and churches in accordance with the law”, Xinhua reported. The party was referring to Buddhist and Taoist temples, which have been receiving more visitors than in the past. There is also some concern in the official atheist party about a section of the Chinese wealthy getting interested in matters of spirituality. The party had earlier warned its members against participating in religious functions. Management of churches has always been a thorny issue because China is opposed to the Pope taking the final decision in the appointment of bishops of Catholic churches. But there has been some easing in restrictions, with Beijing recently approving the appointments of a few bishops done by the Vatican. The decision to “guide” religious institutions shows that the party has not been happy with the state of things, and is getting ready to issue new orders about instilling values of patriotism and socialism in religious practices. The meeting involved 11 national and several other leaders representing different Chinese provinces. Even more significant was that the CPPCC, which is the topmost political advisory body, opened up this discussion over a digital platform available on smartphones. The idea was to encourage wider consultation among party leaders in different parts of the country. China has been using mobile phone apps for consensus-building, though critics say the decision-making process is top down because the party cadre usually echo the views of senior leaders. The country’s political advisors emphasised the need for shrine managers to utilise the internet and big data to set up a digital platform for religious affairs management. They also proposed improvement in policies, laws and regulations to better guide temples and churches to strengthen self-management, Xinhua said.

"70211387"|"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/shanghai-leads-chinas-most-ambitious-garbage-separation-programme/articleshow/70211387.cms"|"[AFP]"|"SHANGHAI: Nie Feng used to toss his rubbish outside his Shanghai flat without a thought while rushing to work, but saving China from a garbage crisis now requires him to consult a complex diagram each morning. On July 1, Shanghai launched China's most ambitious garbage separation and recycling programme ever, as the country confronts a rising tide of trash created by increasing consumption. But the programme is the talk of China's biggest city for other reasons as well: confusion over rules and fines for infractions, and thousands of volunteers inspecting citizens' private garbage each day. Nie examines a wall-sized diagram saying fish and pork bones must be separated from each other, and from the plastic bag he carries them in. ""It's for the good of our homeland, but we keep making mistakes,"" said Nie, a trading company staffer, laughing as he struggled to separate the bag's contents into various bins. ""We have to get this right before the fines really start."" Shanghai is piloting a programme set for eventual nationwide adoption in what would likely be the world's largest waste separation and recycling scheme -- and it is desperately needed. With its 1.4 billion consumers, China is becoming swamped by trash. Every day, Shanghai's 25 million people alone produce around 26,000 tonnes -- equal in weight to the Statue of Liberty. The issue is straining municipal services nationwide and prompting unrest. Last week authorities in the central city of Wuhan sent riot police to quell protests by thousands of citizens against construction of a waste incinerator. China is spending billions of dollars on waste-to-energy incineration plants across the country, but repeated protests have flared over fears they will emit toxins. Wuhan has shelved its plan, for now. China produced just 30 million tonnes of trash in 1980, but that soared to 210 million in 2017, according to World Bank figures. That is still less than the world's trash titan, the United States, which produced 258 million tonnes. But China is gaining fast and the World Bank predicts Chinese garbage could reach a staggering 500 million tonnes annually by 2030. Several factors are blamed, including rapid growth and the Communist Party's ongoing push to develop a domestic consumer economy to lessen reliance on the outside world. Led by the likes of Alibaba, Chinese e-commerce has exploded, producing billions of parcel deliveries annually with their associated packaging. The government indicated its alarm last year by banning certain imports of foreign waste that it used to accept for years for recycling, a move that has up-ended global garbage flows. ""We need a really big push and I think the government realised that. There is really a sense of urgency,"" said Alizee Buysschaert, founder and director of environmental consultancy Zero Waste Shanghai. With a phased national roll-out set to gain pace next year, Shanghai's experience has become one of the most talked-about topics in the country, though sometimes for the wrong reasons. Critics have taken aim at seemingly contradictory sorting guidelines and the limited daily hours during which dumping is allowed, which causes problems for those with irregular schedules. Chinese media reports also have indicated that a lot of garbage was still entering bins unsorted. Government officials declined AFP interview requests. Previous city-level sorting schemes have fizzled, but Buysschaert sees a difference this time. ""The big shift is that it is much more centralised and it's incentivised now. That's really a game-changer because now everyone is talking about it and everyone is involved and on their toes,"" she said. Authorities say strict sorting is crucial, making it far easier to separately process recycled items, hazardous waste, compost and biomass. But tempers have flared. Chinese media said a 33-year-old woman was detained last week for choking a volunteer sorting inspector unconscious during a rules dispute. Fines range from 200 yuan ($29) for household infractions to 50,000 yuan for businesses, though authorities are going easy on imposing them for now. The scheme is a business opportunity for others, with start-ups offering app-based garbage collection and sorting services. True to form, the Communist Party is pushing obeisance via a public campaign larded with red banners emblazoned with revolutionary exhortations such as ""storm the citadel of trash sorting."" ""We weren't used to it at first. It was really inconvenient,"" said 67-year-old pensioner Zhou Shenzhu. But she has been won over by a noticeable reduction in flies and odour since sorting started, she says. ""The propaganda on television says we face great harm if we don't separate.""

In the French capital, the new mobility revolution has caught on fast, with locals and tourists embracing the growing array of app-based ways to get around. And with climate change bringing frequent heatwaves and more peak pollution alerts, Paris is beginning to push back against the dominance of the car. Not only is the city upgrading its public transport system offering of interurban trains, buses and the metro, it is also enjoying an unparalleled explosion of alternatives. ""Our cities have been colonised by cars. They get into the smallest gaps, today we need to put them back into their proper place,"" says Christophe Najdovski, the city's deputy mayor who has responsibility for transport. ""In Paris, they are only used for 10 per cent of daily trips but they take up 50 per cent of the public space."" But the city has been at the forefront of innovation, setting up a pioneering bike-share service back in 2007. Known as Velib', it has since been copied across the globe, from London to Chicago. Then came the Autolib' electric car-sharing scheme which was followed by a flood of dockless bikes, and then the overnight appearance of e-scooters that exploded onto the streets in the summer of 2018. And that's without mentioning other private mobility devices such as two-wheeled e-hoverboards or electric unicycles. But is there enough space? Not according to the taxi drivers, who are already infuriated with the growing demands on their space and the planned 1,000-kilometres (600 miles) of bike lanes that are due to be completed by 2020. And the estimated 15,000 e-scooters on the streets have also triggered a backlash, with riders initially dumping them randomly on pavements, cluttering the curb and creating a nuisance for pedestrians. ""I'd like to slap them,"" fumes Nordine, a woman in her 40s walking through the Marais district, muttering furiously about ""the lack of public spirit"". "" Paris is a great playing field but the space is saturated. They need to bring it back down to two or three operators, like San Francisco, which has just two,"" says Najdovski from the mayor's office. At its height, Paris had 13 companies running scooter fleets, but that number dropped to around seven earlier this month after the city brought in a raft of demands for operators. Every day, there are some 41 million trips made in the Paris region, of which 15 million are by car and 10 million by public transport. Since July 1, all diesel vehicles registered before 2006 have been banned from entering the city, but should the authorities go further and shut the entire city centre to cars? Today, just over a third -- 37 percent -- of Parisian homes have a car, and that drops to one in five in the city centre, according to the mayor's office. ""The priority is to enable city dwellers to get around,"" says Jean-Pierre Orfeuil, an engineer who specialises in urban mobility. ""Generally speaking, those who are using these new means of transport are people who used to use the metro,"" he said. ""So they haven't played a role in easing the traffic."" To get away from fuel-powered vehicles, the focus should be on electric bikes, which could potentially help those living in the suburbs, he says. But even there, the infrastructure is lacking. ""In France, we are two or three times worse off than Germany or the Netherlands"" in terms of the number of electric bikes, he said. Although car-sharing has been slow to take off in France compared with its neighbours, one way to encourage this could be shared lanes, notably on the city's choked peripherique, its 34-kilometre ring road. ""At rush hour, you have an average of 1.1 people in every car. If you increased that to 1.7 it would get rid of the congestion,"" Nadjovski said. But these new forms of transport don't work for everyone, notably raising questions for those with families. And for many city dwellers, the car is a private space akin to their living room which offers a certain form of intimacy, says Orfeuil. ""You can make private calls, you can listen to music."" For Mireille Apel-Muller, a sociologist who heads the City on the Move Institute, mobility is about more than just transport. ""It's a way of life,"" she said. ""All these new forms of transport require a smartphone and applications which you have to master. Otherwise, it becomes exclusive.""

General Ershad ruled Bangladesh for nearly a decade before being ousted from power in a pro-democracy upsurge in 1990 and was jailed for years on corruption charges. He passed away due to complications from old age, Kazi Firoz Rashid, a longtime colleague and lawmaker from his Jatiya Party, told AFP. Armed forces spokesman Abdullah bin Zaid confirmed the death. Ershad, who was also a prolific poet, was the head of the country's armed forces in 1982 when he took power in a bloodless coup after removing an elected government from power. His rule was marked by a controversial decision to make Islam the state religion of the officially secular Muslim-majority nation. In comments made to local reporters from jail in 1996, he said that his ""greatest failure... was running the country softly with a heart of a poet"". Despite the slew of cases against him, Ershad emerged as one of Bangladesh's major power brokers in the 1990s after his Jatiya Party became the country's third biggest political outfit. Since his ouster at the hands of current Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and main opposition leader Khaleda Zia, the two women have become bitter rivals, with the government last year jailing Zia for a decade over graft charges. The former general became a key ally of Hasina and remained hugely popular in his home district in the country's north from where he was elected member of parliament six times in a row.

A suicide bomber rammed a vehicle loaded with explosives into the Medina hotel in the port town of Kismayo on Friday before several heavily armed gunmen forced their way inside, shooting as they went, authorities said. The siege lasted for almost 12 hours and only ended on Saturday morning after clashes with security forces. Three Kenyans, three Tanzanians, two Americans, one British and one Canadian were among the 26 people killed in the attack, president Ahmed Mohamed Islam of the semi-autonomous Jubaland region told a news conference. ""There are also two wounded Chinese citizens,"" he added. AFP confirmed with family members that at least four of the dead had dual nationality. ""The security forces are in control now and the last terrorist was shot and killed"", Mohamed Abdiweli, a security official, said. ""There are dead bodies and wounded people strewn inside the hotel,"" Abdiweli said. He said authorities believed four gunmen, who one witness described as wearing Somali police uniforms, were involved in the attack. Shabaab, the Al-Qaeda-linked group, claimed responsibility for the siege describing it as ""a martyrdom attack"" ""There is chaos inside, I saw several dead bodies carried from the scene and people are fleeing from the nearby buildings,"" witness Hussein Muktar said during the assault. ""The blast was very big,"" he added. The attack is the latest in a long line of bombing and assaults claimed by Al-Shabaab. Witnesses said among those killed were a well-known social media activist and a local journalist. ""The relatives of local journalist Mohamed Sahal confirmed his death and I'm getting that social media activist Hodan Naleyeh and her husband also died in the blast,"" witness Ahmed Farhan said. The Somali journalists' union SJS confirmed the reporters' deaths. ""It is a very sad day for Somalian journalists,"" the union's secretary-general Ahmed Mumin said in a statement. According to several sources, most of those staying in the hotel were politicians and traders ahead of upcoming regional elections. ""The whole building is in ruins, there are dead bodies and wounded who have been recovered from inside. The security forces have cordoned off the whole area,"" said witness Muna Abdirahman. Shabaab fighters have fought for more than a decade to topple the Somali government. The militant group emerged from Islamic Courts that once controlled central and southern Somalia and are variously estimated to number between 5,000 and 9,000 men. In 2010, the Shabaab declared their allegiance to Al-Qaeda. In 2011, they fled positions they once held in Mogadishu, and have since lost many strongholds. But they retain control of large rural swathes of the country and continue to wage a guerrilla war against the authorities.

Authorities urged citizens to secure property, stock up provisions and shelter in place. However, some nervous residents opted to flee the city, and tourism officials reported an abrupt exodus of out-of-town visitors on Friday. Mandatory evacuations were ordered in outlying coastal areas beyond the protection of levees in neighboring Plaquemines and Jefferson parishes south of the city. The storm, packing maximum sustained winds of 65 miles per hour (100 kph), was on track to reach hurricane strength shortly before crossing the Louisiana coastline southwest of New Orleans on Saturday, the National Weather Service said. Landfall was expected around sunrise. Meteorologists warned that torrential rain - as much as 2 feet (60cm) in some places - could unleash severe flooding as the storm moves inland from the Gulf of Mexico, where oil and gas operations have already cut production by nearly 60 percent. US President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency for Louisiana on Friday, freeing up federal disaster assistance if needed. The impending storm could test beefed-up flood defenses put in place since the 2005 calamity of Hurricane Katrina, which left much of New Orleans underwater and killed about 1,800 people. Too much water The brunt of Barry's force was expected to skirt the western edge of New Orleans, avoiding a direct hit on a low-lying city virtually surrounded on all sides by rising waters. But Mayor LaToya Cantrell said 48 hours of heavy downpours could overwhelm pumps designed to purge streets and storm drains of excess water. ""There is no system in the world that can handle that amount of rainfall in such a short period,"" Cantrell said on Twitter. Authorities were paying specially close attention to the levee system built to contain the lower Mississippi River, which winds through the heart of New Orleans and was already above flood stage from months of heavy upstream rainfall over the Midwest. A coastal storm surge into the mouth of the Mississippi was expected to push its crest to 19 feet (5.79m) in New Orleans on Saturday, the highest level since 1950 and dangerously close to the top of the city's levees. New Orleans was already saturated after thunderstorms drenched it with a foot of rain on Wednesday. While street flooding seemed probable, the US Army Corps of Engineers insisted that significant breaching of the 20-foot-tall levees in New Orleans was unlikely. Levee floodgates normally left open to allow passage of traffic were being closed, along with a giant ocean surge barrier erected after Katrina. The level of Lake Pontchartrain, an estuary on the city's northern flank, rose by 3 feet on Friday, triggering closure of a floodgate on a drainage canal that breached during Katrina, officials said. Ahead of the storm, New Orleans residents flocked to supermarkets for bottled water, ice, snacks and beer, thronging grocery stores in such numbers that some ran out of shopping carts. Across the city, motorists left cars parked on the raised median strips of roadways, hoping the extra elevation would protect them from flood damage. Sandbags were stacked outside of hotels, shops and other businesses along Canal Street. The sheriff's office said dozens of jail inmates held on minor charges were released to make room for nearly 70 inmates transferred from a temporary lockup to the main detention facility, which was built to withstand a major hurricane. City residents were asked to remain indoors after 8pm but some, in keeping with New Orleans' party spirit, decided to hunker down in more festive surroundings. ""The rain's not going to shut us down, we're going to shut this place down,"" said Brett Tidball, 33, who gathered with eight friends at Bourbon Street bar for his bachelor party, asking the pianist for back-to-back songs about bad whether. Prince's ""Purple Rain"" echoed down the street.

The Munich zoo has joined Pride week with an unusual look into the intimate lives of all creatures great and small, seeking to boost tolerance among humans. ""It is important for us to talk about"" homosexuality in the animal kingdom and show that same-sex love has its place in Nature, said Munich zoo spokesman Dennis Spaeth. Photos: AFP Baboons groom in their enclosure of the zoo Hellabrunn in Munich. ""Because unfortunately in Germany we see more and more people from the reactionary right attacking LGBTQI rights."" While even mostly-Catholic Bavaria has grown more accepting and lawmakers legalised gay marriage in 2017, non-heterosexuals are sometimes still a target for violence. Police recorded 91 attacks based on the victim's sexual orientation last year. In the safe confines of the zoo, the first stop on the Pride tour is the giraffes. The blotchy animals spare visitors only occasional curious glances from behind their long eyelashes as they enjoy a meal of hay. Meerkats stand together in their enclosure. ""Giraffes are bisexual. In some groups, 90 per cent of the acts observed are in fact homosexual in nature,"" explained biologist Guenter Strauss. A few enclosures down, there is little to distinguish a male-male couple of black-faced Humboldt penguins squatting together from other, mixed pairs. That is until the guide points out that with no egg to care for, the pair has taken to brooding a rock instead. This is no one-off fling, as ""penguins conduct homosexual relationships that can last a whole lifetime, something very rare in the animal kingdom,"" said Strauss. In fact, hundreds of animal species, from elephants to snakes and birds, display homosexual behaviour. Elephants play together in the enclosure. But unlike most humans, the sexual preference of our four-legged or feathered friends is often quite fluid. ""Among people, we grow up with a specific sexual orientation. That's often not true for animals,"" said Strauss. ""They are in fact bisexual. They adopt certain sexual behaviour at specific moments."" One case in point are lions, and the zoo's male big cat greets the group with a loud roar. ""Servus!"" responded Strauss in a regional greeting redolent of traditional, conservative Bavarian culture. ""Eight percent of sex acts among lions are homosexual. As for lionesses, they only show lesbian behaviour when they're kept in captivity,"" he explained. While same-sex love among animals is commonplace, the topic was long a taboo for scientists of more hidebound eras. ""On one expedition to the South Pole at the start of the 20th century, a doctor saw males (penguins) copulating — but he left out the pages dealing with the behaviour when he published the results of his research,"" Strauss recounted. Considered unpalatable back then, the valuable pages were only rediscovered ""eight or nine years ago"" in a library in Britain, he added. Times have changed since then. London Zoo, for its contribution to Pride week, mounted a banner above its penguin beach, declaring: ""Some penguins are gay. Get over it,"" a nod to a human anti-homophobic campaign.

The move comes after Washington approved the sale of $2.2 billion worth of military hardware, including tanks and missiles. Though this is not directly related to the ongoing US-China trade war, the new move will definitely worsen the relationship between the world’s first and second-biggest economies. The US decision has “harmed China’s sovereignty and national security”, the Chinese foreign ministry said, adding that sanctions against the supplying companies are necessary to safeguard its national interests. Beijing had earlier requested the US not to go ahead with the sales. China regards Taiwan as its own territory although it has its own currency, military and relationships with some foreign countries. The US defence department has notified Congress about the proposed arms sales, which include 108 M1A2T Abrams tanks, Hercules armoured vehicles, heavy equipment transporters and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles. The proposed sales may further test relations between the US and China, already strained by protracted trade tensions. They swiftly drew the ire of Beijing, which sees such sales as interference in its sovereignty claims over the self-ruled island. It coincided with Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen’s arrival in the US on Thursday as part of a visit to four Caribbean allies, a trip that has also prompted anger from Beijing. China’s foreign ministry urged the US on Tuesday to immediately withdraw the proposed sales and said it had lodged “stern representations”. The official China Daily said Ms Tsai was “playing a game of brinksmanship” by building up Taiwan’s military defence. The controversy over Taiwan has taken a new turn with Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen telling a group of diplomats in Washington on Thursday that her country will apply for membership of the United Nations. She is visiting the US and a few other countries. “Taiwan will never succumb to any threats (from Beijing), now or in the future,” Taiwan’s presidential office quoted Tsai as saying. “Any obstacles will only strengthen Taiwan’s resolution to join the international community.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."|"China threatens to ban US firms selling arms to Taiwan"|"Sat Jul 13 06:11:00 CEST 2019"|"[world]"

The 5.8-magnitude quake struck the northeast coast of Mindanao island at 4:42am (2042 GMT Friday) at a depth of 11.8 kilometres (7.3 miles), with the Philippine seismology office also recording seven less intense aftershocks. Officers at the police station in Madrid town, near the epicentre, ducked beneath tables as the glass door of a filing cabinet splintered and a television set fell and shattered off a table, said its police chief Lieutenant Wilson Uanite. ""We saw people running out of their homes. A number of residences sustained minor damage like cracked walls,"" Uanite told AFP by telephone. Patients were also evacuated at the Madrid District Hospital, which sustained cracks on its concrete walls, he added. The roof of an old car park in Madrid collapsed, causing slight damage to the town's two fire trucks and three cars, Uanite said. The impact was also felt in four neighbouring towns, damaging homes, two Catholic churches, a hotel, a gym, a bridge and a public market, the civil defence office in the region said in a written report.

In the French capital, the new mobility revolution has caught on fast, with locals and tourists embracing the growing array of app-based ways to get around. And with climate change bringing frequent heatwaves and more peak pollution alerts, Paris is beginning to push back against the dominance of the car. Not only is the city upgrading its public transport system offering of interurban trains, buses and the metro, it is also enjoying an unparalleled explosion of alternatives. ""Our cities have been colonised by cars. They get into the smallest gaps, today we need to put them back into their proper place,"" says Christophe Najdovski, the city's deputy mayor who has responsibility for transport. ""In Paris, they are only used for 10 percent of daily trips but they take up 50 percent of the public space."" But the city has been at the forefront of innovation, setting up a pioneering bike-share service back in 2007. Known as Velib', it has since been copied across the globe, from London to Chicago. Then came the Autolib' electric car-sharing scheme which was followed by a flood of dockless bikes, and then the overnight appearance of e-scooters that exploded onto the streets in the summer of 2018. And that's without mentioning other private mobility devices such as two-wheeled e-hoverboards or electric unicycles. But is there enough space? Not according to the taxi drivers, who are already infuriated with the growing demands on their space and the planned 1,000-kilometres (600 miles) of bike lanes that are due to be completed by 2020. And the estimated 15,000 e-scooters on the streets have also triggered a backlash, with riders initially dumping them randomly on pavements, cluttering the curb and creating a nuisance for pedestrians. ""I'd like to slap them,"" fumes Nordine, a woman in her 40s walking through the Marais district, muttering furiously about ""the lack of public spirit"". ""Paris is a great playing field but the space is saturated. They need to bring it back down to two or three operators, like San Francisco, which has just two,"" says Najdovski from the mayor's office. At its height, Paris had 13 companies running scooter fleets, but that number dropped to around seven earlier this month after the city brought in a raft of demands for operators. Every day, there are some 41 million trips made in the Paris region, of which 15 million are by car and 10 million by public transport. Since July 1, all diesel vehicles registered before 2006 have been banned from entering the city, but should the authorities go further and shut the entire city centre to cars? Today, just over a third -- 37 percent -- of Parisian homes have a car, and that drops to one in five in the city centre, according to the mayor's office. ""The priority is to enable city dwellers to get around,"" says Jean-Pierre Orfeuil, an engineer who specialises in urban mobility. ""Generally speaking, those who are using these new means of transport are people who used to use the metro,"" he said. ""So they haven't played a role in easing the traffic."" To get away from fuel-powered vehicles, the focus should be on electric bikes, which could potentially help those living in the suburbs, he says. But even there, the infrastructure is lacking. ""In France, we are two or three times worse off than Germany or the Netherlands"" in terms of the number of electric bikes, he said. Although car-sharing has been slow to take off in France compared with its neighbours, one way to encourage this could be shared lanes, notably on the city's choked peripherique, its 34-kilometre ring road. ""At rush hour, you have an average of 1.1 people in every car. If you increased that to 1.7 it would get rid of the congestion,"" Nadjovski said. But these new forms of transport don't work for everyone, notably raising questions for those with families. And for many city dwellers, the car is a private space akin to their living room which offers a certain form of intimacy, says Orfeuil. ""You can make private calls, you can listen to music."" For Mireille Apel-Muller, a sociologist who heads the City on the Move Institute, mobility is about more than just transport. ""It's a way of life,"" she said. ""All these new forms of transport require a smartphone and applications which you have to master. Otherwise, it becomes exclusive.""

May, who is currently serving as caretaker Prime Minister during the course of a leadership contest between UK foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt and former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, was forced to announce her resignation amid mounting rebellion within her own Cabinet over Brexit at the end of May. ""It had been incredibly frustrating that MPs on either side of the Leave-Remain divide had got so sort of entrenched that they just were not willing to make that compromise that would enable us to get the majority to get this through,"" May said in a BBC interview in 10 Downing Street on Friday. ""I sacrificed my job in order to try to get a deal.

Qureshi gave a half-hour speech on Thursday on “media freedom in Pakistan” at a session titled “Strengthening Media Freedom across the Commonwealth” but most international journalists walked out in silent protest, leaving around 15 people in the room. “There were chairs for 500 people and only 15 people present for the talk. Six of them were Pakistan media, six were Pakistan high commission and foreign office officials and three to four were security. All the journalists emptied the hall out in protest at the censorship in Pakistan,” a source present told TOI. “Three or four media organisations wanted to protest Qureshi’s presence but the UK government told them not to, so instead they lobbied all the individual journalists and delegates not to attend his session.” But that did not stop Qureshi making a speech about media freedom in Pakistan. He said as foreign minister he was representative of a society “that passionately embraces diversity of opinion, accepts dissent and celebrates freedom of expression. Turn on any TV set, pick up any newspaper, any social media platform in Pakistan, and you will be deluged by a cacophony of voices and a multiplicity of perspectives”. “Pakistan media today is perhaps more free, more diverse, and more forceful than in many across the developing world — perhaps even freer than many other democracies…,” he said. “Media freedom as a value is dear to me personally and to us as a nation… We have a very independent judiciary so, believe me, there is no question of gagging or controlling the media.

Qureshi gave a half-hour speech on Thursday on “media freedom in Pakistan” at a session titled “Strengthening Media Freedom across the Commonwealth” but most international journalists walked out in silent protest, leaving around 15 people in the room. “There were chairs for 500 people and only 15 people present for the talk. Six of them were Pakistan media, six were Pakistan high commission and foreign office officials and three to four were security. All the journalists emptied the hall out in protest at the censorship in Pakistan,” a source present told TOI. “Three or four media organisations wanted to protest Qureshi’spresence but the UK government told them not to, so instead they lobbied all the individual journalists and delegates not to attend his session.” But that did not stop Qureshi making a speech about media freedom in Pakistan. He said as foreign minister he was representative of a society “that passionately embraces diversity of opinion, accepts dissent and celebrates freedom of expression. Turn on any TV set, pick up any newspaper, any social media platform in Pakistan, and you will be deluged by a cacophony of voices and a multiplicity of perspectives”. “Pakistan media today is perhaps more free, more diverse, and more forceful than in many across the developing world — perhaps even freer than many other democracies…,” he said. “Media freedom as a value is dear to me personally and to us as a nation… We have a very independent judiciary so, believe me, there is no question of gagging or controlling the media. With the new social media, even if you want to gag you can gag nothing.” But that did not convince Canadian reporter Ezra Levant, a news personality with right-wing website TheRebel.media, who had had a blazing row with the minister during the question and answer session over a tweet he wrote on Pakistan’s blasphemy laws that he said the Pakistan government got taken down. “You censored me.

The graphic video, released by the Fullerton police department following questions from the teen's family, shows Hannah Williams collapsing and pleading for help after she was shot on July 5. The replica gun can be seen lying next to her in the video. Police on Friday also released audio of an emergency call the teen's father, Benson Williams, made about 90 minutes after the shooting to report his daughter missing. Williams tearfully tells the dispatcher in the call that he fears his daughter might harm herself and that she was on anti-depressants. Police said the deadly encounter unfolded after the officer involved in the shooting spotted the teen driving at high speed on a freeway as he was taking his K-9 dog to the veterinarian. He chased her vehicle and attempted to stop her, but at some point she made an abrupt U-turn into oncoming traffic and skidded to a stop facing the wrong way. The video footage shows the officer exiting his car and walking around the van Williams was driving. As he approaches the driver's side of the vehicle, he is confronted by Williams who can be seen walking towards him with her arms outstretched in a ""shooting stance."" Shots are then fired and Williams is seen collapsing on the ground and pleading for help. The teen's family have questioned the circumstances around the shooting and have called for state authorities to launch an independent investigation.

"70188381"|"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-president-donald-trump-abandons-bid-to-include-citizenship-question-on-census/articleshow/70188381.cms"|"[AP]"|"WASHINGTON: Just a week after insisting that he was ""absolutely moving forward,"" US President Donald Trump abandoned his effort to insert a citizenship question into next year's census. He directed federal agencies to try to compile the information using existing databases instead. ""It is essential that we have a clear breakdown of the number of citizens and non-citizens that make up the US populations,"" Trump declared in a Rose Garden announcement, insisting that he was ""not backing down."" But the decision was clearly a reversal, after the Supreme Court blocked his effort by disputing his administration's rationale for demanding that census respondents declare whether or not they were citizens. Trump had said last week that he was ""very seriously"" considering an executive order to try to force the question. But the government has already begun the lengthy and expensive process of printing the census questionnaire without it, and such a move would surely have drawn an immediate legal challenge. Instead, Trump said on Thursday that he would be signing an executive order directing every federal department and agency to provide the commerce department with all records pertaining to the number of citizens and noncitizens in the country. Late on Thursday, justice department lawyers sent a copy of the executive order to the judge presiding over a challenge to the citizenship question in Manhattan federal court, saying they will confer with lawyers for the plaintiffs to see how to proceed in the case. Trump's order said the Supreme Court ""has now made it impossible, as a practical matter, to include a citizenship question on the 2020 decennial census questionnaire."" ""After examining every possible alternative, the attorney general and the secretary of commerce have informed me that the logistics and timing for carrying out the census, combined with delays from continuing litigation, leave no practical mechanism for including the question on the 2020 decennial census,"" Trump said. Trump's efforts to add the question on the decennial census had drawn fury and backlash from critics who complained that it would discourage participation, not only by people living in the country illegally but also by citizens who fear that participating would expose noncitizen family members to repercussions. Dale Ho, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Voting Rights Project, and the lawyer who argued the Supreme Court case, celebrated Thursday's announcement by the President, saying: ""Trump's attempt to weaponize the census ends not with a bang but a whimper."" Trump said his order would apply to every agency, including the department of homeland security and the social security administration. The census bureau already has access to social security, food stamp and federal prison records, all of which contain citizenship information. Trump, citing census bureau projections, predicted that using previously available records, the administration could determine the citizenship of 90 per cent of the population ""or more."" ""Ultimately this will allow us to have a more complete count of citizens than through asking the single question alone,"" he contended. But it is still unclear what Trump intends to do with the citizenship information. Federal law prohibits the use of census information to identify individuals, though that restriction has been breached in the past. The executive order's text states that ""generating accurate data concerning the total number of citizens, non-citizens, and illegal aliens in the country has nothing to do with enforcing immigration laws against particular individuals,"" and that information would be used ""solely to produce statistics"" and would not be used to ""bring immigration enforcement actions against particular individuals."" Still, it requests extensive and detailed information, including national-level files of all lawful permanent residents, customs and border arrival and departure data , and social security administration master beneficiary records. It also instructs the commerce secretary to consider beginning the process of including the question on the 2030 census count. Civil rights group, meanwhile said the President's efforts had already sown fear and discord in vulnerable communities, making the task of an accurate count even harder. ""The damage has already been done,"" said Lizette Escobedo of the national association of Latino elected and appointed officials educational fund. The census bureau had stressed repeatedly that it could produce better citizenship data without adding the question and had recommended combining information from the annual American community survey with records held by other federal agencies that already include citizenship records. But commerce secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the Census Bureau, ultimately rejected that approach and ordered the citizenship question be added to the census. The American community survey, which polls 3.5 million US households every year, already includes questions about respondents' citizenship. ""It's a retreat back to what he should have done from the beginning,"" said Kenneth Prewitt, a former census bureau director. Trump's administration had faced numerous roadblocks to adding the question, beginning with the ruling by the Supreme Court temporarily barring its inclusion on the grounds that the government's justification was insufficient. But Trump insisted his administration was pushing forward, publicly contradicting government lawyers and his commerce secretary, who had previously conceded the case was closed, as well as the census bureau, which had started the process of printing the 2020 questionnaire without the controversial query after the Supreme Court decision. As he has many times before, Trump exploded the situation with a tweet, calling reports that the fight was over ""FAKE!"" ""We are absolutely moving forward, as we must, because of the importance of the answer to this question,"" he wrote. A week of speculation about the administration's plans and renewed court battles ensued as Trump threw out ideas, including suggesting last week that officials might be able to add an addendum to the questionnaire with the question after it was printed. And he toyed with the idea of halting the constitutionally mandated survey entirely while the court battle played out. Attorney general William Barr, however, said that the government had no interest in delaying the count and that, while he was confident the census question would have eventually survived legal review, the process would have taken too long to work its way through the courts. Trump had offered multiple explanations for why he believed the question was necessary to include in the once-a-decade population count that determines the allocation of seats in the House of Representatives for the next 10 years and the distribution of some $675 billion in federal spending. ""You need it for Congress, for districting. You need it for appropriations. Where are the funds going? How many people are there? Are they citizens? Are they not citizens? You need it for many reasons,"" he told reporters last week, despite the fact that congressional districts are based on total population, regardless of residents' national origin or immigration status. He said on Thursday the data could also help states that ""may want to draw state and local legislative districts based upon the voter-eligible population."" That would mark a change from how districts are drawn currently, based on the entire population, and could increase Republican political power. If immigrants are undercounted, Democrats fear that would pull money and political power away from Democratic-led cities where immigrants tend to cluster, and shift it to whiter, rural areas where Republicans do well.

The weather system is expected to reach hurricane strength Friday or early Saturday when it nears Louisiana's coast, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC), and has already caused major flooding in the low-lying city. Trump on Thursday issued a national disaster declaration, which will allow federal agencies to participate in emergency relief efforts, in response to a request by Louisiana governor John Bel Edwards. ""Thank you President Trump for quickly responding to my request... We appreciate the support of the White House and our federal partners as we continue our unprecedented flood fight,"" the governor said in a tweet Thursday. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) separately announced that it would temporarily halt immigration enforcement activity in areas subject to the state of emergency. It said that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency would not target migrant families who were evacuating during the storm, ahead of sweeping operations nationwide to detain and deport illegal immigrants expected to start this weekend. ""Our highest priority remains the preservation of life and safety. In consideration of these circumstances, there will be no immigration enforcement initiatives associated with evacuations or sheltering related to the storm, except in the event of a serious public safety threat,"" the agency said in a Thursday press release. The incoming storm has evoked memories of Hurricane Katrina, the costliest and deadliest hurricane in US history, which submerged about 80 percent of New Orleans as the city's flood defenses gave way. Katrina also pounded other parts of Louisiana as well as Mississippi and Alabama, leading to about 1,800 deaths and more than $150 billion in damage.

About 20 others stood nearby calling for legalization of dog meat. There were no reports of violence. Under a traditional calendar, Friday is thought to be the first of three hottest days in South Korea. Many South Koreans believe that eating dog meat or chicken soup on those days gives them strength to beat the heat. ""They do not need your tears, they need your help,"" Basinger said of the dogs. ""We have to end this cruelty on this planet. We have to help anything suffering."" The protesters held placards that read ""How Many Millions Have to Die Before Dog Meat Ends?"" They also put mock dog carcasses on a table. About 10 meters (30 feet) away, farmers who raise dogs that are sold to restaurants brought steamed dog meat and ate it with kimchi. Anti-dog meat rallies routinely take place on the three hottest days. Dog meat is neither legal nor explicitly banned in South Korea. Dog meat restaurants are a dwindling business as younger people find dog meat a less attractive dining option. Pets are growing in popularity, and a survey last year indicated that about 80% of South Koreans had not eaten dog meat in the previous year. Many people still oppose outlawing dog meat because they view it as surrendering to Western pressure. Some older people believe that dog meat enhances sexual stamina.

Kim You-geun, deputy chief of South Korea's presidential national security office, said South Korea has been thoroughly implementing UN sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear weapons program. He demanded that Japan provide evidence for claims made by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his conservative aides that there may have been illegal transfers of sensitive materials from South Korea to North Korea. Tokyo last week tightened the approval process for Japanese shipments of photoresists and other sensitive materials to South Korea, saying such materials can be exported only to trustworthy trading partners. The move, which could potentially hurt South Korean technology companies that manufacture semiconductors and display screens used in TVs and smartphones, has triggered a full-blown diplomatic dispute between the countries that further soured relations long troubled over Japan's brutal colonial rule of Korea before the end of World War II. Kim said the Seoul government proposes Japan accept an inquiry by the UN or another international body over the export controls of both countries to end ""needless arguments"" and to clearly prove whether the Japanese claims are true or not. ""If the result of the investigation reveals that our government did something wrong, our government will apologize for it and immediately apply measures to correct it,"" said Kim, reading a prepared statement on live TV. ""If the result shows that our government has done nothing wrong, the Japanese government should not only apologize but also immediately withdraw the exports restrictions that have the characteristics of a (political) retaliation. There also should be a thorough investigation on (any) Japanese violation,"" he said. South Korea has denied the Japanese allegations that it allowed sensitive materials to reach North Korea. The Foreign Ministry in Seoul summoned a Japanese Embassy official on Monday to protest Abe's comments that questioned the credibility of Seoul's sanctions implementation. South Korea's trade minister on Tuesday said an ""emergency inspection"" of companies that process and export the chemicals imported from Japan found no sign of illegal transactions allowing them to reach North Korea or any other country affected by United Nations sanctions. Meanwhile In Tokyo, export officials from both sides sat down together on Friday the first since Japan tightened the approval process for shipments to South Korean companies.

""The delivery of the first shipment of parts of the S-400 long range regional air missile defence system began as of July 12, 2019 to Murted air base in Ankara,"" the ministry said in a statement. The delivery, which was made by plane, is likely to escalate tensions with the US after Washington warned this week that there would be ""real and negative"" consequences if Ankara bought the Russian defence system. The US State Department has said that Turkish officials are fully aware of the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, a law passed by Congress in 2017 that mandates sanctions for any ""significant"" purchases of weapons from Russia. Washington has threatened to remove Turkey from its F-35 fighter jet programme, giving Ankara until July 31 to cancel the S-400 purchase or have its pilots kicked off the training course and expelled from the US. But Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after meeting US counterpart Donald Trump last month that he was confident Ankara would not face sanctions for buying the Russian missile system. Erdogan told Trump during their meeting on the margins of the G-20 meeting in Japan that former president Barack Obama did not allow Ankara to buy Patriot missiles- an equivalent of the S-400s.

The removal of accountability court judge Arshad Malik prompted immediate calls by Sharif's PML-N party for the release of the 69-year-old former premier, who is serving a seven-year jail sentence. ""The decision against Nawaz Sharif should be dismissed and he should be released immediately,"" party spokeswoman Marriyum Aurangzeb said, adding that Sharif's conviction should be considered ""void"". Sharif was convicted and jailed last year after failing to prove the source of income that had led to his ownership of a steel mill in Saudi Arabia. Under Pakistani law, this is taken to prove corruption. The PML-N has disputed the conviction and last week party leaders presented a video apparently showing Malik saying he had been pressured into ruling in favour of conviction by individuals with compromising footage against him. Malik later issued a statement denying he had been blackmailed to convict Sharif and saying the video had been manipulated. He also declared in an affidavit he had been offered bribes followed by blackmail threats by figures close to Sharif to rule in favour of the former premier. After days of growing pressure, Islamabad High Court asked the law ministry to remove him from his position. ""Judge Arshad Malik was asked to stop working on the basis of the alleged video and the press release,"" Law Minister Farogh Naseem told a news conference. The scandal adds to an already heated political climate in Pakistan where Prime Minister Imran Khan's government, which came to power last year vowing to root out corruption, has been facing increasing economic difficulties. Earlier this month it agreed to a $6 billion bailout deal with the International Monetary Fund, which has demanded a tough package of austerity measures. As the problems have mounted, opposition parties have stepped up attacks, accusing the government and its allies in the powerful military establishment of crushing dissent and orchestrating Sharif's removal from power and conviction.

Officials were expecting to find at least the bones of Princess Sophie von Hohenlohe, who died in 1836, and Princess Carlotta Federica of Mecklenburg, who died in 1840, but there was no trace of either. “The result of the search was negative. No human remains or funeral urns were found,” Vatican spokesman Alessandro Gisotti said. Gisotti said the Vatican would now examine records structural work done in the cemetery at the end of the 19th century and again about 60 years ago to see if they could shed any light on the new mystery. Theories about Orlandi's disappearance have run the gamut from an attempt to secure freedom for Mehmet Ali Agca, the Turk jailed in 1981 for trying to assassinate Pope John Paul II, to a connection to the grave of Enrico De Pedis, a mobster buried in a Rome basilica. His tomb was opened in 2012 but nothing was revealed. The Orlandi family received an anonymous letter saying Emanuela’s body might be hidden among the dead in the Teutonic Cemetery where a statue of an angel holding a book reads “Requiescat in Pace”, Latin for “Rest in Peace”. The two tombs were opened in the presence of the Orlandi family and descendants of the princesses, who were all equally shocked.

""The delivery of the first shipment of parts of the S-400 long range regional air missile defence system began as of July 12, 2019 to Murted air base in Ankara,"" the ministry said in a statement. The delivery, which was made by plane, is likely to escalate tensions with the US after Washington warned this week that there would be ""real and negative"" consequences if Ankara bought the Russian defence system. The US State Department has said that Turkish officials are fully aware of the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, a law passed by Congress in 2017 that mandates sanctions for any ""significant"" purchases of weapons from Russia. Washington has threatened to remove Turkey from its F-35 fighter jet programme, giving Ankara until July 31 to cancel the S-400 purchase or have its pilots kicked off the training course and expelled from the US. But Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after meeting US counterpart Donald Trump last month that he was confident Ankara would not face sanctions for buying the Russian missile system. Erdogan told Trump during their meeting on the margins of the G-20 meeting in Japan that former president Barack Obama did not allow Ankara to buy Patriot missiles -- an equivalent of the S-400s. Trump sounded convinced and said: ""You can't do business that way. It's not good.""

The Grace 1 was seized by British Royal Marines off the coast of Gibraltar on suspicion of violating sanctions against Syria. ""The decisions of Her Majesty's government of Gibraltar were taken totally independently, based on breaches of existing law and not at all based on extraneous political considerations,"" Fabian Picardo told Gibraltar's parliament. ""These important decisions about breaches of our laws were not decisions taken at the political behest or instruction of any other state or third party.""

The affair has led to an increase in tension in the Gulf, with Britain saying on Thursday that it fended off Iranian ships that tried to block a British tanker. Tehran blames the United States for arranging to have its ship seized. Washington has imposed sanctions against Iran with the aim of halting all Iranian oil exports. European countries do not have sanctions against Iran, but have had them in place against Iran's ally Syria since 2011. Police in Gibraltar said on Thursday they had arrested the captain and chief officer of the supertanker and seized documents and electronic devices. Picardo said it was carrying 2.1 million barrels of light crude oil. ""All relevant decisions in respect of this matter were taken only as a direct result of the government of Gibraltar having reasonable grounds to believe the vessel was acting in breach of established EU sanctions against Syria,"" Picardo said.

Qureshi was attending a press conference on 'Defend Media Freedom' here on Thursday when the incident took place, days after Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) suspended transmission of three private TV channels for airing an interview of jailed former President Asif Ali Zardari. The move came as the Pakistan government decided to curtail the space given by the press to jailed politicians like Pakistan's former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and Zardari. Journalist Ezra Levant of the Rebel media, a Canadian far-right political website, interrupted and verbally assaulted the minister alleging that his Twitter account was suspended over complaints from the Pakistan government, the Dawn newspaper reported. “That's exactly what I'm talking about. Twitter didn't delete my whole account. But they deleted a tweet they said violated Pakistani law. Twitter said that to me in an email. I'm in Canada. Twitter is in America. But Pakistan censored us,” he said. In a video clip of the incident shared by Pakistan journalist Munizae Jahangir on Twitter, Levant said the organisers should be embarrassed to invite a “censorious thug” to talk about free speech. Levant also accused the minister of adopting double standards on free speech, the report said. Responding to the allegations, Qureshi said, “first of all you want your sentiments to be respected. Just look at the tone to the panel you have adopted. Is that the correct way? You have a right to ask questions.” “You have double standards what you call freedom; at times you are projecting certain agendas,” the minister said. Replying to a question on Pemra's recent decision to take three television channels off air, the arrest of journalists and deepening concerns about censorship, Qureshi said there was “no question of gagging” journalists. “Believe you me, there is no question of gagging or controlling media,” he told the conference co-hosted by Britain and Canada. “That time has gone and with the new social media, the advent of social media, even if you want to gag you can gag nothing,” he said. Further explaining, Qureshi said that three news channels were taken off and ""I'm told for 6-8 hours, and now they are functioning again.” He said the channels had “issues” with the regulatory body and “those issues have been settled.” Qureshi was also asked about an interview of Zardari, which was also abruptly taken off air. Pemra had on July 1 taken off air an interview of the former president which was being conducted on the premises of the Parliament House, where Zardari came to attend a National Assembly session after the speaker issued his production order. Qureshi said Zardari, who is currently facing corruption charges, was not permitted to be interviewed in the way he was, “otherwise he can say what he wants to”. The media curbs imposed by Pemra has been criticised by a media watchdog. ""This is an absolutely unacceptable violation of the principles of media pluralism and independence during a revelation that was clearly in the Pakistani public interest,"" said Daniel Bastard, head of Reporters Without Borders' Asia-Pacific desk, in a statement on Tuesday.

Head of the Tibetan government-in exile Lobsang Sangay, in an interview to the BBC earlier this month, said that such detention camps existed in Tibet. When asked about the reports that such camps were being held by China in Tibet too, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang, during a media briefing on Friday, said, ""What has been motioned in the report is totally untrue."" Sangey, in the BBC's 'Hard Talk' programme on July 1, had said that the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) secretary of Xinjiang Chen Quanguo was previously the party secretary of Tibet before he was shifted to Xinjiang. ""He is the same architect. He implemented the same repressive policies in Tibet for five years which he is implementing in one year time in Xinjiang,"" Sangey had claimed. ""We do have these camps, but not as large as the Uighur camps. So, lot of people have been sent for education through labour, imprisonment, tension,"" he said.

Even for Xinjiang it is being estimated that more than million or more (have been detained)."" ""As far as we know the political prisoners who were arrested and imprisoned (in Tibet) we are talking of few thousands,"" he said.

South Korea, a major US ally, received its first two F-35A jets — one of the world's most advanced military aircraft — in March under a $7 billion contract signed in 2014. The country plans to deploy 40 of the American jets by the end of 2021, with around a quarter of those expected to be operational this year. South Korean authorities ""know well that the bringing-in of the Fighters would prove to be an extremely dangerous action which will trigger our reaction,"" an unnamed researcher at the Institute for American Studies of North Korea's ministry of foreign affairs said in a statement carried by state news agency KCNA. ""We... have no other choice but to develop and test the special armaments to completely destroy the lethal weapons reinforced in South Korea,"" it said. The statement said that two more F-35As were due to be delivered to South Korea from the US in mid-July. Seoul's defence ministry declined to comment on whether this was the case. The two neighbours are technically still at war after the 1950-53 Korean War ended with a ceasefire instead of a peace treaty. Tensions were raised in May when North Korea fired short-range missiles for the first time since November 2017, during a standstill in its talks with Washington over denuclearisation. Nuclear-armed Pyongyang has criticised Seoul for not pursuing inter-Korean economic projects as discussed in summit meetings between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in last year. Several sets of sanctions, imposed on the North over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, currently block many proposed developments in sectors from industry to tourism.

The British navy says it thwarted an attempt by the Iranians to impede the passage of a British oil tanker, a day after Iran warned of repercussions after its own supertanker was seized by authorities in Gibraltar for allegedly trying to breach European sanctions on oil shipments to Syria. About a fifth of all oil traded around the world goes through the Strait of Hormuz, so any conflict could cause huge disruption to crude supplies for energy-hungry countries, particularly in Asia. Here's a look at the crucial waterway and its importance for the global economy. WHERE IS THE STRAIT OF HORMUZ? The narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf is in the territorial waters of Iran and Oman. At its narrowest point the strait is just 33 kilometers (21 miles) wide. The width of the shipping lane in either direction is only 3 kilometers (2 miles). It flows into the Gulf of Oman. WHY IS IT IMPORTANT? About 20% of all oil traded worldwide passes through the strait. Some 18.5 million barrels of oil are transported through it every day from major OPEC producers Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait. About 80% of that goes to fast-growing countries in Asia, including China, Japan, India and South Korea. The strait is also used to export about a third of the world's liquefied natural gas, from Qatar, the world's biggest LNG producer. Anything affecting the narrow passage ripples through global energy markets, raising the price of crude oil. That in turn affects gas prices and the broader economy. WHAT HAPPENS NOW? The confrontation on Thursday comes amid heightened tensions between the United States and Iran over the unraveling 2015 nuclear deal, which the Trump administration abandoned last year in favor of a campaign of maximum sanctions on Iran that have devastated its economy. Both sides have taken steps in recent months that seem calculated to raise pressure on the other without triggering an all-out conflict. Iran has begun openly breaching limits on uranium enrichment set by the accord, saying the US sanctions make it untenable. The US has meanwhile dispatched a carrier group, bombers and fighter jets to the region to counter unspecified Iranian threats. Iran shot down a US drone last month that it said had veered into its airspace. The US says the drone was in international airspace. The US has also accused Iran of being behind a series of mysterious attacks on oil tankers in the region, allegations denied by Tehran. The maneuvers carried out early Thursday may have just been a show of force — Iran's Revolutionary Guard denied it had tried to seize any vessels. But the potential for miscalculation on either side remains high, and any escalation would place the region in even greater peril.

"70173619"|"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/troubled-waters-china-fuelled-cruise-boom-sparks-environment-fears/articleshow/70173619.cms"|"[AFP]"|"SINGAPORE: Cruises are enjoying a boom fuelled in part by hordes of Chinese tourists taking to the high seas, but green groups warn a wave of hulking new liners may cause environmental devastation. Gone are the days when cruising was the preserve of retirees, who would while away the hours lounging in deckchairs, playing bingo or taking part in formal dinner-dances. Modern liners resemble floating, futuristic cities capable of carrying thousands of passengers, where robot bartenders serve drinks and passengers can enjoy hi-tech entertainment. Many of the new, more sophisticated ships aim to appeal to the rapidly growing Chinese cruise market -- now the second-biggest in the world after the US -- and are choosing cities in the Asian giant as their home ports. As tourism booms in increasingly wealthy China, there is a growing ""desire and enthusiasm"" for cruises, said Wang Mi, spokeswoman for Chinese online travel agency Tuniu. ""Cruise products are very popular with seniors, families and honeymooners in China,"" she told AFP. About 30 million people worldwide are expected to go on a cruise this year, up nearly 70 percent from a decade ago, according to the Cruise Lines International Association. While the more mature US market remains the largest globally, China is growing fast -- last year about 2.4 million Chinese tourists went on a cruise, more than triple the number in 2014. There is rising demand right across Asia with growth at double digits in some countries, said Gavin Smith, senior vice president international of US cruise giant Royal Caribbean. ""The Asian market is increasingly important to global cruising,"" he said. MONSTER LINERS But the rising number of monster liners, often hundreds of metres long and several stories high, has increased concerns about environmental damage. ""We see a big range of environmental impacts from the cruise industry -- everything from air pollution to waste water, sewage, oily discharges, food wastes, plastics,"" Marcie Keever, oceans and vessels programme director at Friends of the Earth US, told AFP. A major concern is high levels of sulphur oxide emissions, a toxic gas which causes respiratory problems and lung disease, and can lead to acid rain and damage aquatic species. In 2017 ships operated by Carnival Corporation -- the world's largest cruise company, which has several brands -- emitted 10 times more sulphur oxide in European seas than all the passenger vehicles in the continent, according to a study by NGO Transport & Environment. Efforts are being made to reduce the amount of the gas emitted. New industry standards will from next year require all ships to cut sulphur oxide content in fuel to a maximum 0.5 percent from the current 3.5 percent limit. There are also worries about the impact of mammoth vessels on the cities they berth at during voyages. A 13-deck liner crashed into a tourist boat in a Venice canal last month, injuring four tourists, and prompting a protest from local residents who called for a ban on large cruise ships in the UNESCO World Heritage site. In addition, ships jettisoning waste at sea and the huge amounts of electricity used by the vessels have angered environmentalists. In June Carnival was fined $20 million in the United States for dumping plastic waste into the ocean and other environmental violations. SKYDIVING, VIRTUAL REALITY TRAMPOLINING Industry players insist they are doing their part to reduce pollution. Royal Caribbean has installed systems that clean almost all sulphur oxide and other pollutants from emissions, according to Nick Rose, the firm's director for environmental programmes. ""Cruise ships are cleaner than ever before and improving with each new class of ship,"" Rose told AFP. Typical of the new generation of liners is Royal Caribbean's Spectrum of the Seas. Custom-built for the Asian market and billed as the region's biggest cruise ship, the 345-metre (1,140-foot) vessel can carry over 5,600 guests. Entertainment includes simulated skydiving in a wind tunnel, bouncing on a trampoline while wearing a virtual reality headset and bumper cars, all aimed at an increasingly younger generation of cruise-goers. There are 17 restaurants onboard and the huge range of accommodation includes a two-storey family suite that comes with a private karaoke room and children's slide. This can cater to Chinese tourists who often go on cruises in large groups. Passenger Sylvia Bau, a veteran cruise-goer on holiday with six relatives, was amazed at the rapid growth of liners over the years. ""You can live in the ship for days without getting bored,"" the 58-year-old Singaporean said as the vessel made a call in the city-state, one of several stops in Southeast Asia before arriving at its home port of Shanghai.

Washington and Beijing have hit each other with punitive tariffs covering more than $360 billion in two-way trade, damaging manufacturers on both sides of the Pacific. US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping agreed to revive negotiations when they met on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Osaka on June 29. ""China's core concerns must be properly resolved, we believe that the two sides can take care of each other's legitimate concerns through dialogue as equals,"" said commerce ministry spokesman Gao Feng. ""We will definitely be able to find solutions to the problems,"" he told reporters at a regular news briefing. Top US and Chinese negotiators held phone talks on Tuesday but it remains unclear if the wide rupture that has formed since talks broke down in May can be patched over. Since the breakdown, China's state media has taken a increasingly nationalistic tone, putting out articles and commentaries blasting the United States and its tariffs. Beijing has also outlined three core concerns it says must be met in order to reach a deal: cancelling all punitive tariffs imposed during the trade war, reaching a more reasonable figure for Chinese purchases of US goods, and ensuring a more ""balanced"" text of the trade agreement. On Thursday, Beijing also called for the US to immediately drop sanctions against Chinese tech giant Huawei, which was blacklisted in May over national security concerns. ""We have noted Huawei and other Chinese entities are still on the US export control list, we urge the US to really fulfil its promises and immediately stop using state power to beat down Chinese companies,"" Gao said. Trump has previously said he could ""imagine Huawei being included in some form or some part of a trade deal"", and in Osaka agreed to soften some restrictions on sales of crucial US components to the firm.

After greeting Denmark's new Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen at the portico of the chancellery, a smiling Merkel walked her over to a podium where both leaders took their seats. The unusual move came a day after a similar ceremony when the German chancellor was seen shaking involuntarily for the third time in public in less than a month, reviving questions over her health. Merkel began trembling as national anthems were being played at the reception of Finnish Prime Minister Antti Rinne. Just over an hour later, she attended a press conference as planned and told journalists that her health was no cause for concern. She explained that she was simply still in a phase of ""processing"" a previous shaking spell, but that ""there has been progress"". ""I will have to live with it for a while,"" added Merkel, who turns 65 next week. ""Just like how it has come, one day it will go away too,"" she said. The shaking on Wednesday was visible although less severe than during the first episode in June. On that occasion she appeared unsteady and shook as she stood in the midday sun next to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whom she was welcoming with military honours. That first bout of shaking was blamed on dehydration. But a second episode struck a week later at the end of June, just hours before she was due to board a plane for a G20 summit in Japan. Merkel has been leader of Europe's biggest economy for almost 14 years. Frequently called the European Union's most influential leader and the most powerful woman in the world, Merkel has said she will leave politics at the end of her term, in 2021.

The not-for-profit Taraki was listed on Tuesday as a finalist in the Influencer of the Year category of the 7th British Indian Awards, which recognise a wide range of achievements of the diaspora. British Punjabi Shuranjeet Singh Takhar, founder and director of Taraki, posted a statement on Twitter explaining that he was “withdrawing Taraki from this opportunity” owing to the “influencer” tag ascribed to Taraki, as well as the term “British Indian” which he said was “an incredibly loaded label”. “Such labels are not devoid of political turbulence,” he wrote. “My understanding of 20th-century histories on the South Asian subcontinent paints a bleak picture for human rights with intense discrimination existing along lines of gender, religion and caste. Events such as the 1992 demolition of the Babri Masjid, the 2002 anti-Muslim riots in Gujarat, and the sustained state genocide against Sikh communities spanning several decades show, in my view, how India has failed to adequately meet the needs of minority communities. To present day, individuals are discriminated against based on race, gender, caste, religion, and more complex intersections,” Takhar said. “If one is labelled an ‘influencer’ we believe that others are seen as ‘influenced’. I do not feel comfortable identifying myself or Taraki as an ‘influencer’ or a movement identified as ‘British Indian’,” he concluded. The awards ceremony will take place at the Holiday Inn in Birmingham on July 26. It is organised by a private company, Oceanic Consulting. A spokesperson for Oceanic Consulting said: “We are very sorry to hear that Taraki do not wish to be recognised for the great work they do within the Punjabi community. Since we launched the ceremony hundreds of British men and women of Indian descent have been recognised for the amazing contribution they have made to life in the UK.” In the last UK census in 2011, 83,362 people refused to select “British Indian” as their ethnicity and instead handwrote “Sikh”. That spurred a plethora of British Sikh organisations and gurdwaras in May to launch a legal challenge to the Cabinet Office's proposals for the 2021 census over its failure to include a Sikh ethnic tick box. Dr Rami Ranger, chairman of Sun Mark Ltd, said he felt Taraki’s move was short-sighted. “The award would have raised the profile of the charity and highlighted their sterling work. Sadly, Taraki is now attracting negative publicity rather than getting applauded for their good work,” he said.

The fire at Power Station No. 27 broke out around 11:00 am on Thursday around 20 kilometres (13 miles) from Moscow. The emergencies ministry said that 11 people received medical treatment including five people with minor burns but no one was hospitalised. There was no risk of the fire spreading to nearby residential areas, it said. The energy ministry said a high-pressure gas pipe supplying fuel was burning outside the power station itself. Russian television reported that the cause of the fire ""could have been an explosion"". The smoke and flames were visible from the capital and the emergencies ministry said that the fire blazed over an area of 800 square metres (8,600 square feet). The plume of fire subsided after authorities switched off the gas supply but black smoke continued to billow as gas already released continued to burn. The emergencies ministry said the fire would be localised shortly. One witness, Sofiya Fesenko, watching the fire from her flat in Mytishi, said on Russian television that hot water flowed from cold taps after the fire broke out. ""We saw smoke covering half the sky,"" she said. The emergency services sent in helicopters to drop water and fire-fighting trains to tackle the blaze, with more than 150 firefighters at the scene. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin wrote on Twitter that the city was sending 50 of its fire engines to the power station. The authorities warned drivers not to use nearby highways as the smoke hindered traffic and one highway leading to Moscow's ring road was closed entirely. The power station was built at the end of the Soviet era and opened in 1996. Its four reactors supply part of Moscow and the Moscow region with electricity and centralised hot water and heating. The energy ministry said electricity supplies to the public would not be affected and the fire did not damage generation equipment at the station.

The incident came almost a week after British Royal Marines boarded an Iranian tanker, the Grace 1, off Gibraltar and seized it on suspicion that it was breaking EU sanctions by taking oil to Syria. KEY SHIPPING LANE Tensions in the Gulf have been rising over recent weeks as Iran began to move away from the terms of a nuclear accord it struck with world powers in 2015 in protest at renewed U.S. sanctions, which have crippled exports of its key revenue earner - crude oil. The United States withdrew from the pact last year and reimposed and extended punitive sanctions on Iran, saying the original pact failed to curb Iran's missile programmes or address U.S. concerns about its behaviour in the Middle East.

His sentencing evoked a sharp reaction in India. India moved the ICJ in May 2017 for the ""egregious violation"" of the provisions of the Vienna Convention by Pakistan by repeatedly denying New Delhi consular access to Jadhav. ""We cannot prejudge the judgment,"" Pakistan Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Muhammad Faisal said at his weekly news briefing. He, however, said that Pakistan has fully contested the case before the Hague-based ICJ. The ICJ has announced, in a statement on July 4, that it will deliver on July 17 its judgment in the Jadhav case. ""A public sitting will take place at 3 p.m. (local time) at the Peace Palace in The Hague, during which Judge Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf, President of the Court, will read the Court's decision,"" it said. Pakistan claims that its security forces arrested Jadhav from restive Balochistan on March 3, 2016 after he reportedly entered from Iran. However, India maintains that Jadhav was kidnapped from Iran where he had business interests after retiring from the Indian Navy.

The raids will be conducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents over a number of days starting July 14, the Times reported citing unnamed sources including two current and one former homeland security officials. Reuters could not independently confirm the pending government action early on Thursday. The officials told the Times that ICE agents were targeting at least 2,000 immigrants who have been ordered deported but remain in the country illegally. Trump said on July 5 that the mass roundups would begin ""fairly soon,"" even as migrant advocates vowed their communities would be ""ready"" when immigration officers come. He postponed the operation last month after the date was leaked, but last week said it would take place after July 4. ""They'll be starting fairly soon, but I don't call them raids, we're removing people, all of these people who have come in over the years illegally,"" Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday. Last month ICE officials said operations would target recently-arrived undocumented migrants in a bid to discourage a surge of Central American families at the southwest border. ICE said in a previous statement its focus was arresting people with criminal histories but any immigrant found in violation of U.S. laws was subject to arrest. The threatened raids have rattled immigrant communities and come after apprehensions of migrants on the southwest border hit a 13-year high in May before easing in June as Mexico increased immigration enforcement. Democratic lawmakers visited an El Paso, Texas, Border Patrol station on Monday and said migrants were being held in ""horrifying"" conditions, with women told to drink out of a toilet, a claim that has been disputed. Immigrant families arrested together will be held together, when possible, in family detention centers in Texas and Pennsylvania, the officials told the Times.

The project- named Artemis- would be the first attempt to return humans to the lunar surface since the last Apollo landing in 1972, but some experts doubt if the deadline is realistic given budgetary constraints and delays in developing the next-generation rockets and equipment needed for the journey. To meet this ""bold challenge"", Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine said in an email to employees that Bill Gerstenmaier, head of the agency's Human Exploration and Operations (HEO) missions directorate, has been removed from his position and assigned an advisory role, the Washington Post and other US news outlets. The widely-respected Gerstenmaier is a Nasa veteran who joined the agency in 1977, rising to become one of its top managers, overseeing the space shuttle program and US operations on the International Space Station before becoming head of HEO. ""We, as a nation, are thankful for his service in advancing America's priorities and expanding the limits of science, technology and exploration,"" Bridenstine wrote of Gerstenmaier in his email, according to CBS News. Former astronaut Ken Bowersox will be the acting head of the section, according to Bridenstine's email. The American plan to return humans to the moon- including the first woman- is beset with delays and cost overruns, according to an official audit released last month. The cost of Boeing's giant Space Launch System (SLS) rocket- at the core of the Artemis project- has risen by nearly 30 percent to $8 billion, and its already-delayed first flight is unlikely to take place by June 2020 as planned. Costs for the Orion capsule being built by Lockheed Martin to transport astronauts have also grown. But Vice President Mike Pence, who announced the accelerated 2024 target in March, has criticized Nasa for ""bureaucratic inertia"" and asked for a new mindset. Critics have said such tight deadlines may lead to serious risk-taking to save time, including reducing the amount of testing done on rockets. Bridenstine has described the 2024 deadline as ""aggressive"" but doable.

Medical examiners said Tuesday that DNA testing determined that pieces of bone recovered from the dogs' feces were those of 57-year-old Freddie Mack, according to the Johnson County Sheriff's Office. Deputy Aaron Pitts said the 18 mixed-breed dogs apparently devoured all of Mack's body, his clothing and his hair, leaving nothing larger than 2-to 5-inch bone fragments. ""Never have we ever, or anyone we've spoken to, heard of an entire human being consumed,'' Pitts told The Associated Press. ""The bones were completely broken up and eaten."" Mack had serious health problems, and it's unclear whether the dogs killed their owner or consumed his body after he died from a medical condition. ""Either way, it is a very gruesome event and we extend our sympathy to Freddie Mack's family,"" Sheriff Adam King said in a statement. In May, a relative reported the reclusive Mack missing from his home near Venus, a community of fewer than 4,000 people about 30 miles (50 kilometers) southwest of Dallas, saying the family hadn't heard from him since mid-April. The aggressive dogs stopped the family from entering Mack's property, and posed problems for deputies, who were eventually able to look around while keeping the dogs away with a ``distraction method,'' according to the sheriff's office. The deputies couldn't locate Mack and, after days of searching, investigators returned to comb the property. Amid the high grass, they found animal feces containing bits of human hair, clothing and bone. The larger fragments were sent to the University of North Texas Center for Human Remains Identification, and were eventually matched to Mack through family DNA testing. Pitts said two of the dogs were killed by their mates, 13 were put down because of their ``aggressive nature'' and three have been put up for adoption. The deputy said that Mack kept his dogs well fed and cared for. The only other time the deputies had dealt with him was in 2017, when Mack called from the hospital to ask if someone could check on his dogs, Pitts said. ""This man loved his animals,'' he said.

The White House confirmation came a day after the State Department had said it had no idea about the upcoming visit -- first reported in the Pakistani media - causing discomfiture in the Islamabad establishment that had leaked reports of the upcoming trip. However, the White House announcement of the visit indicated that the issue of terrorism, instability, and violence will dominate the conversation given Pakistan's destabilising role in the region, including in Afghanistan and India. ""The visit will focus on strengthening cooperation between the United States and Pakistan to bring peace, stability, and economic prosperity to a region that has seen far too much conflict. President Trump and Prime Minister Khan will discuss a range of issues, including counterterrorism, defense, energy, and trade, with the goal of creating the conditions for a peaceful South Asia and an enduring partnership between our two countries,"" the statement from the White House Press Secretary said. Khan is expected to be in the US for three days in an effort to restore Pakistan’s frayed ties with the US that went further south after Trump came to office. The US President, clearly not a fan of Pakistan, has repeatedly berated Islamabad for taking American money and not doing anything for the US. “We paid Pakistan Billions of Dollars & they never told us he was living there. Fools!” he said in one tweet, referring to Osama bin Laden being found in a hideout in Abbottabad. After cutting off $1.6 in military aid to Pakistan, he told Fox News, “They don't do anything for us, they don't do a damn thing for us."" Trump's attack also brought a sharp retort from Imran Khan, who maintained that Pakistan was the victim of over 75,000 deaths and lost over $123 billion because of the United State’s “War on Terror”, though no Pakistani nationals were involved in the plot and execution of the tragic events of 9/11. “Record needs to be put straight on Mr Trump's tirade against Pakistan: 1. No Pakistani was involved in 9/11 but Pak decided to participate in US War on Terror. 2. Pakistan suffered 75,000 casualties in this war & over $123 bn was lost to economy. US ""aid"" was a miniscule $20 bn,” he tweeted. “Instead of making Pakistan a scapegoat for their failures, the US should do a serious assessment of why, despite 140000 NATO troops plus 250,000 Afghan troops & reportedly $1 trillion spent on war in Afghanistan, the Taliban today are stronger than before,” Khan taunted over Twitter. For now though the two sides appeared to have put aside the spat and are getting ready to reset ties – with some help from Senator Lindsey Graham, member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a close Trump associate - -partly on account of the US need to exit from Afghanistan. It is Graham, who was once a “never-Trumper” and called Trump the “world’s biggest jackass,” who visited Pakistan in January this year and began pushing the US President to meet Khan, ostensibly after assessing the ground situation in the region. In fact, Khan is coming to the US with top military aides, suggesting there will be some effort at restoring defense ties that have gone off the rails although Pakistan is too broke to buy any American military hardware.

The couple, in their sixties, who split their time between Sindri in Dhanbad and Delhi, were visiting their son, Saurav Anand, in his thirties, who works at Royal Bank of Scotland in Edinburgh. Anand moved to Britain in 2011 for his master’s. His parents had come to stay with him on a one-and-a-half-month trip. “It was the most racist, embarrassing and humiliating incidents in my life. I don’t think my parents ever want to come back to Scotland,” Anand told TOI. He relayed how on Saturday at about 8 pm they were travelling on a train from Edinburgh to Armadale, together with Anand’s Polish girlfriend. His mother, Sheila Singh, was wearing a sawleer-kameez, and father Arbind Kumar was in a shirt and trousers. “There was a man in his 40s with a younger man aged around 17 in the same carriage. Both had ponytails and the older man was covered in tattoos. They looked like father and son and locals. Both were white. I was talking to my dad and the older guy kept staring at us and then he said something to his son. The son stared at us a few times and it looked like they were talking about us. Then the older guy opened a pack of crisps and stuck his tongue out at my dad whilst drinking a can of beer, which he passed to his son. They got off at the next stop but stood on the platform and didn’t go anywhere. The train started moving and the younger one came up to the window where we were sitting, said something, looked at my dad and then spat at us through the window. I got up and shouted at him but the train had already left and then they both started walking off. It all happened in a split second.” Anand said he has dealt with subtle incidents of racism here in the past and moved on, but it is the fact it happened in front of his family that made him take it up with the police. “My parents got scared for me as well and are now saying, ‘Why are you here? Come back to India.’ They are shocked. My dad is a retired professor of history. He said to me: ‘It’s like the people here are still living in the colonial era and think they are superior,’” Anand said. “My dad has a lot of self-respect. He has never been spat at by a young kid in India. It seems like in Scotland they lack diversity education. Crime is very high in west Scotland and there are a lot of drugs and alcohol problems,” Anand said. “My mother told me not to report it to the police as she didn’t want any trouble. She was almost in tears when the cops came round on Sunday. She is worried they will come back for me. I do not want these men to get away with this. The police are going to look at the CCTV.” A spokeswoman for British Transport Police said: “Officers received a report of a racially aggravated incident on board a train to Uphall at around 8 pm on Saturday, July 6. It is believed two men spat on a family’s window as they left the train at the station, having made them feel uncomfortable during the journey. Enquiries into the incident are ongoing.” Six months ago Anand says he was falsely accused of shoplifting in an Armadale supermarket in what he believes was a racist incident. He wrote to the store afterwards to complain and they sent him a gift to apologise.

On that occasion she appeared unsteady and shook as she stood in the midday sun next to visiting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whom she was welcoming with military honours. The first bout of shaking was blamed on dehydration, but a second episode struck a week later at the end of June, just hours before she was due to board a plane for the G20 summit in Japan. Officials had sought then to play down fears over her health, with her spokesman saying that she would not cancel any planned engagements. Merkel, who turns 65 in a week, has always enjoyed relatively robust health.

Von der Leyen, Germany's defence minister and a Merkel ally, needs to be confirmed in her new job by an absolute majority of EU lawmakers, and may hit resistance in an assembly aggrieved that EU leaders ignored the lead candidates from the main parliamentary blocs in their horse-trading over top posts.

But with reference to the SPD's EU lawmakers, she added: ""All 16 members have said that they cannot approve the personnel proposal (of von der Leyen as Commission president).

French Health Minister Agnes Buzyn said the refunds paid by French social security — currently 30 percent of the treatment — will be phased down to 15 percent in 2020 and then to zero in 2021. ""I have decided to start the process for complete non-reimbursement,"" Buzyn told the Le Parisien daily, adding that she was following the advice of the French National Authority for Health (HAS). She added that the transition period would allow both patients and pharmaceutical companies to adapt to the new system. The HAS had at the end of June published a damning scientific view, saying that homeopathy had ""not demonstrated scientifically a sufficient effectiveness to justify a reimbursement"". Buzyn acknowledged that the move could prove unpopular and emphasised it would not stop doctors prescribing homeopathic medicines or patients from buying them. French company Boiron, the world leader in homeopathic products, denounced what it said was an ""incomprehensible and incoherent decision"". It asked for an urgent meeting with President Emmanuel Macron and said it would ""do everything to fight"" the decision. But Buzyn's move also failed to satisfy opponents of homeopathy who said they did not understand the need for the transition period to phase it out. ""Going to 15 percent makes no sense,"" said Francois Morel of Fakemed, a group of doctors who have waged a high-profile campaign against homeopathy. ""The HAS has made clear the absence of specific effectiveness of homeopathy,"" he added. According to official figures, French social security in 2018 paid back patients some 126.8 million euros ($142.2 million) for homeopathic treatment out of a total of 20 billion euros ($22.4 billion) refunded for medicines in total. Buzyn, a prominent haematologist and university professor with no prior experience in politics before joining the government in 2017, has repeatedly made clear the importance of following scientific advice from the HAS. According to French press reports, she had made clear that her position was at stake on the homeopathy issue, saying that the scientific credibility of the government was on the line. Debate has raged about homeopathy since the concept first emerged at the end of the eighteenth century, with critics damning it is no more than pseudoscience. It is based on the idea that a substance that causes certain symptoms can also help to remove those same symptoms.

Holding forth before a rapt crowd at a wine-tasting in the French capital, Peyrat begins by sticking his expert nose into a glass of chilled rose: it is important to get a good whiff before tasting the wine. Once in the mouth, the wine is swirled around — or chewed — for a few seconds. The taster may then make a “duck face” to allow a bit of air in to detect further characteristics, a step called “grumage”. Next, the mouthful of liquid is spewed back out in an unapologetic burst into a spittoon. For professionals, tasting wine means assessing its appearance, or robe, its interaction with air, its aromas and finally its taste, as well as its “structure” in the mouth. The first step is to identify the wine’s basic quality: is it bitter, sweet, salty, acid or umami — that elusive taste between acid and sweet that is prized in Asia? The appraisal then turns to the tactile sensation the vintage creates: coarse, astringent, effervescent? Spitting the wine out is intrinsic to a tasting. “People think swallowing the wine will give you more aromas, but that’s false,” said Olivier Thienot, who founded the Ecole du Vin de France in 2003. “The aromas often come after the spitting,” agrees Christophe Marchais, an oenologist from western France, acknowledging that the act may seem “a bit bizarre”. Spitting, when the wine mixes with air coming from the nose, can bring out “other prevalent aromatic notes”, Peyrat says, calling the process “retro-olfaction”. It “is a much more intense pleasure than being drunk,” he adds. For France’s some 7,000 oenologists, “spitting is an ordinary act”, says Thienot, adding a professional taster can assess as many as 100 wines on a given day.

It’s the end of the road for a vehicle that has symbolised many things over a history spanning the eight decades since 1938. It has been: a part of Germany’s darkest hours as a never-realized Nazi prestige project. A symbol of Germany’s postwar economic renaissance and rising middle-class prosperity. An example of globalisation. An emblem of the 1960s counterculture in the US. Above all, the car remains a landmark in design. The car’s original design can be traced back to Austrian engineer Ferdinand Porsche, who was hired to fulfill Adolf Hitler’s project for a “people’s car” that would spread auto ownership the way the Ford Model T had in the US. Mass production of what was called the KdF-Wagen, based on the acronym of the Nazi labour organisation under whose auspices it was to be sold, was cancelled due to WW II. Re-launched as a civilian carmaker under supervision of the British occupation authorities, the Volkswagen factory was transferred in 1949 to the Germany government. By 1955, the one millionth Beetle had rolled off the assembly line in the town of Wolfsburg. The US became Volkswagen’s most important single foreign market, peaking at 5,63,522 cars in 1968, or 40% of production. “Unlike in West Germany, where its low price, quality and durability stood for a new postwar normality, in the US the Beetle’s characteristics lent it a profoundly unconventional air in a car culture dominated by size and showmanship,” wrote Bernhard Rieger in his 2013 history, “The People’s Car”.

Merkel began shaking involuntarily as national anthems were being played at the reception of Finnish Prime Minister Antti Rinne. But she attended a press conference as planned just around an hour later, telling journalists that her health was no cause for concern. ""I feel very well, there is no need to worry,"" she said, adding that she was simply still in a phase of ""processing"" a previous shaking spell, but that ""there has been progress"". ""I must now keep going with that,"" added Merkel, who turns 65 next week. A source close to the government had said the cause of the repeat shaking was now psychological, with memories of the first incident provoking renewed trembling at events with similar settings. The shaking on Wednesday was visible although less severe than during the first episode in June. On that occasion she appeared unsteady and shook as she stood in the midday sun next to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whom she was welcoming with military honours. That first bout of shaking was blamed on dehydration, but a second episode struck a week later at the end of June, just hours before she was due to board a plane for a G20 summit in Japan. Officials had sought to play down fears over her health then, saying that she was fine and that she would not be cancelling any planned engagements. Merkel, who has been leader of Europe's biggest economy for almost 14 years, has always enjoyed relatively robust health. Frequently called the European Union's most influential leader and the most powerful woman in the world, Merkel has said she will leave politics at the end of her term, in 2021. But she has struggled to stamp out repeated speculation that she may leave the political stage earlier than planned. The coalition that she had forged with the centre-left Social Democratic Party was fragile from the start, and has lurched from crisis to crisis. The latest health scares have prompted additional questions over the length of her reign. There were brief concerns about her well-being in 2014 when she was taken ill during a television interview. The broadcast was interrupted when she experienced a drop in blood pressure. Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert explained at the time that the leader did not feel well for a moment, then ate and drank something and continued the interview. Earlier that same year, she had fractured her pelvis while cross-country skiing in Switzerland and was ordered to cut back her schedule dramatically and stay in bed as much as possible for three weeks. A keen hiker too, Merkel herself once revealed that she has a ""camel-like"" ability to store energy for sleepless all-night summits. In case of emergency, Merkel would be replaced by Vice Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who would carry out her duties until parliament elected a new leader.

Violence has long ravaged the poor but resource-rich Pacific Ocean nation, but the scale of the latest bloodletting has shocked the country. ""It's a very sad story,"" Philip Undialu, the governor of Hela Province in the rugged central highlands where the attack took place, told Reuters by phone. Pictures posted on Facebook showed the dead, including several children, from the Monday violence wrapped in cloth and laid on palm leaves by the side of a road. Undialu said the particular trigger for the killings in Karida village, some 630 km (390 miles) northwest of the capital, Port Moresby, was not known but the violence was the latest flare-up of a conflict running for years. Those targeted had offered shelter to victims of a bout of violence several weeks ago, he said. ""It was retaliation of a previous attack ... it was a very sudden attack,"" he said, adding that in all, 24 people had been killed in the latest phase of violence. ""Both attacks were made in an innocent community where people were not expecting it and all of us are in a state of shock."" Prime Minister Marape said he was ""coming for"" the killers. ""In memory of the innocent who continue to die at the hands of gun-toting criminals, your time is up,"" Marape said in a post on his official Facebook page. ""Before I had someone else to report to, now I have no one else to report to but the innocent you kill,"" he said. ""I am not afraid to use strongest measures in law on you ... I am coming for you."" Marape, who became leader in May, cited a lack of police on the ground as a major problem in a region that has for years grappled with violence, sometimes driven by disputes over the distribution of resource wealth. Last year, aid workers bringing relief supplies to the area's district town of Tari after a big earthquake were ordered out and the army was sent in to quell tribal disputes.

The Directorate General of Customs said Tuesday that 49 containers at Batam port near Singapore will be returned to Australia, the U.S., France, Germany and Hong Kong after inspections showed their contents violated Indonesian laws on the import of hazardous and toxic waste. Separately, the head of customs at East Java's Tanjung Perak port, Basuki Suryanto, said eight other containers with 210 tons of waste that arrived from Australia on June 20 were supposed to contain only paper but included other matter. ``It turned out those containers also had household waste, used cans, plastic bottles, used oil packaging, used electronics, used baby diapers and used footwear. So we decided to return it to the country of origin,'' he said. China banned the import of plastic waste at the end of 2017, resulting in more being sent to developing Southeast Asian nations. A study published in June last year in the journal Science Advances that used United Nations data found other nations would need to find a home for more than 110 million tons of plastic waste by 2030 because of the Chinese ban. Indonesia and China are themselves among the world's biggest producers of plastic waste, which is increasingly fouling their own land, seas and beaches. Suryanto said the Indonesian-owned company that imported the Australian waste to the East Java port is obliged to return it to Australia within 90 days. No other sanctions were planned, he said. Directorate General of Customs spokesman Deni Surjantiro said the 49 containers to be repatriated from Batam were among 65 containers of waste inspected at the port. Eleven were filled with plastic trash and 38 contaminated by toxic or otherwise hazardous waste, he said. Importing hazardous waste into Indonesia is a criminal offense, Surjantiro said, with a maximum 12-year prison sentence and a maximum fine of 12 billion rupiah ($850,000). The Philippines was recently involved in a high-profile spat with Canada over what Philippine officials said was illegally transported garbage and in May sent 69 containers back to Canada. Malaysia in May said it would send back some 3,000 tons of non-recyclable plastic waste to countries such as the US, UK, Canada and Australia Philippine officials said the Canadian garbage was transported to their country in 103 containers in 2013 and 2014 and falsely declared as recyclable plastic scraps. Some of the garbage was disposed of, leaving 69 containers of electrical and household waste, including used diapers, rotting in two Philippine ports.

She will also be fined $40,000. Claiborne was a Department of State office management specialist based in Beijing and Shanghai who became involved beginning in 2007 with two men the Justice Department said she knew were agents of China's Ministry of State Security.

The state's off-year election will be closely watched because Virginia is the only state where control of the Legislature is up for grabs in 2019. Republicans currently hold a narrow majority. GOP lawmakers abruptly ended the session after less than two hours and postponed any movement on gun laws until after the November election. Democrats and gun-control advocates vowed to force them from office. ""If these `leaders' won't enact solutions that their own constituents are demanding, then we're going to fight tooth and nail for representatives who will,"" Kris Brown, president of the Brady gun-control group, said in a statement. Scores of gun-control advocates gathered Tuesday outside the Capitol, jeering at Republicans like House Speaker Kirk Cox. Meanwhile, hundreds of gun-rights supporters filed through a legislative office building to meet with lawmakers and in a show of force against stricter gun laws. National Rifle Association spokeswoman Catherine Mortensen called it ""deja vu in Virginia."" ""The gun control lobby says this every election cycle, and time and time again the hundreds of thousands of Virginians who support their fundamental right to self-defense go to the polls,"" she said. ""...This year the gun control lobby is screaming louder than ever in an effort to distract voters"" from scandals involving top Democrats. Virginia is generally considered a gun-friendly state and is home to NRA's headquarters. The General Assembly has rejected numerous gun-control bills _ including several proposed for the special session _ year after year. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's gun-control group made a splash at the tail end of the 2015 legislative elections by announcing it was spending $2.2 million in two open state Senate races to help the Democratic candidates. Republicans were shocked at the amount the billionaire's group was putting into Virginia, but the spending did not appear to make much difference. One Bloomberg-backed candidate won in a Northern Virginia district that has voted reliably Democratic by large margins in past elections while the other Democratic nominee lost in pivotal swing-seat in the Richmond area. Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam summoned the Republican-led Legislature to the Capitol to address gun violence in the wake of the May 31 attack that killed a dozen people in Virginia Beach. He put forward a package of eight gun-control measures and called for ""votes and laws, not thoughts and prayers"" in response to the massacre. Republicans said it was Northam, still dealing with the fallout of a blackface scandal that almost drove him from office, who had acted improperly. They assigned the state's bipartisan crime commission to study policy proposals that might have prevented the shooting. ""Quite frankly, we need to take a little bit deeper look at these issues and actually do something rather than stage manage a vote in which we're just trying to embarrass each other,"" state Sen. Mark Obenshain said. Richard Keene, a 51-year-old gun owner from Chesterfield, said the session turned out to be ""a lot of hype for nothing."" ""I'm a little disappointed in everyone, actually,"" he said. ""I don't feel like the common, normal person, the normal American, is represented anymore. It's frustrating."" The special session got off to a chaotic start, with the Republican Senate majority leader averting a mutiny in the GOP caucus by publicly disavowing a gun-control bill he proposed only a day earlier. On Monday, the leader, Tommy Norment, shocked fellow Republicans by filing surprise legislation to broadly ban guns in any government building statewide. That prompted an immediate backlash in the GOP caucus, which controls the chamber by a slim 20-19 advantage. His top vote-counter, Sen. Bill Stanley, resigned as majority whip in protest. But the departure did not last long. Stanley said Norment apologized and asked Stanley to reconsider his resignation. The caucus quickly restored him to his position, and Norment announced that he would throw out his own bill. After the adjournment, Northam issued a statement saying it was ""shameful and disappointing"" that Republicans ""refuse to do their jobs and take immediate action to save lives."" The Virginia Beach attack began when a civil engineer opened fire on his co-workers and others. Police said DeWayne Craddock used two semi-automatic handguns, a silencer and extended ammunition magazines to kill 12 people at a municipal building. Craddock was then killed in a gunbattle with police.

The country is in the process of updating its family code to make it more equitable to women - a move President Donald Trump's eldest daughter and senior adviser praised as ""a great step forward."" ""We are pleased to recognize and applaud the Ivorian government's recent passage of the marriage law, which supports women's equal management of household assets,"" she said in a statement to The Associated Press. While the legislation proposing the changes had already been in the pipeline at the time of Ivanka Trump's visit, her team is pointing to it as a sign of the potential impact of the global women's initiative she championed. It aims to empower 50 million women in developing countries around the world by 2025 by providing job training and financial support and supporting legal and regulatory changes. The White House's Women's Global Development and Prosperity Initiative was launched in February and received an initial investment of $50 million from the US Agency for International Development. In her conversations with Ivory Coast Vice President Daniel Duncan during her visit, Ivanka Trump said, she and her team encouraged the passage of legislation to advance women's rights and legal status, including doing away with laws that restricted women from owning or inheriting property. Under the revised code, husbands and wives will have more equal say in managing household assets and making financial decisions. That's in addition to other changes, such as new measures to ensure that widows are entitled to inheritances, additional protections against domestic violence, and setting the minimum age for marriage at 18 for both women and men. Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara's governing coalition dissolved in 2012 after some members resigned in protest of a proposed marriage law that would have made wives the joint heads of households. This time, however, the measures have drawn little protest. W-GDP and the Millennium Challenge Corporation, an independent US foreign assistance agency, said in a joint statement that the laws' passage ""signals a new direction in Cote d'Ivoire that recognizes the critical role women play in advancing economic prosperity in their family, community, and for their country."" Ivanka Trump has made women's economic empowerment a centerpiece of her White House portfolio and has made a number of international trips to highlight the issue.

But with many educators saying kids can do better in a more relaxed and flexible learning environment, designers and architects have been providing spaces and furnishings to fit that bill. “Innovators no longer say ‘classrooms’,” says Bob Pearlman, an education consultant. “Students now work in learning studios, plazas and home bases. They shift into varied extended learning areas and collaboration zones that include project-planning rooms, workrooms, focused labs, group learning spaces, individual pods.” Another new reality changing the dynamic: connectivity. “Classrooms, libraries, and labs used to be the only spaces where students spent time. Wireless, laptops and project learning have changed that,” Pearlman says. “This has transformed all school spaces into potential learning areas, even corridors and alcoves.” Back in the 1970s, American psychologist Robert Sommer was urging a critical look at traditional classroom layouts, saying classrooms aren’t just simple cubes, says Jo Earp, editor of a magazine. Sommer noted that in any given room, the lighting or heating will be better in certain spots, as will the view of the blackboard. Besides the alternative “freeform” classroom, Earp says, teachers can find good results with a hybrid model, perhaps lining up desks at the start of the year and then rearranging them in groups as the classroom dynamic becomes clearer. New designs include internal glass walls and doors that increase connectedness among students and provide good sightlines for teachers. Over the decades, designers have lent talents to school furniture. Today, classroom furniture runs the gamut from chairs to chaises, with work tables of varying heights. Imagine Charter Schools, based in Virginia, and operating schools in nine states, offers colourful swivel seating, as well as comfy upholstered benches. Montessori schools have soft lighting similar to home environments, and more subdued furniture and decor than traditional classrooms. Myers loves that designers are coming up with more seating options for students. “Children shouldn’t be expected to sit still in a chair for more than 20 minutes.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."|"How schools are rethinking the classroom"|"Wed Jul 10 09:05:00 CEST 2019"|"[world]"

The report on progress towards achieving the 17 UN goals notes achievements in some areas, including a 49% fall in child mortality between 2000 and 2017 as well as electricity now reaching nearly 90% of the world's population. But Liu Zhenmin, the UN under secretary-general for economic and social affairs, said that despite some advances, ""monumental challenges remain."" He said at a news conference the most urgent area for action is climate change, which ""may impact the progress made over the last several decades"" in reducing poverty and improving life for millions of people around the world. According to the report, biodiversity loss is happening at an accelerated rate, and ""the risk of species extinction has worsened by almost 10 per cent over the last 25 years."" Global temperatures have risen, ocean acidity has increased 26% since pre-industrial times and ""investment in fossil fuels continues to be higher than investment in climate activities,"" it said. Liu said the report also shows ""inequality is rising and too many people are left behind."" He said that ""is another big challenge for the world."" The first of the 17 goals adopted by world leaders in 2015 is to eliminate extreme poverty - people living on less than $1.90 a day - and the second goal is to end hunger, achieve food security and promote sustainable agriculture. According to the report, neither goal is likely to be achieved by 2030. While the number of people living in extreme poverty declined to 8.6% of the world's population in 2018, the report said the pace is slowing and projections suggest that 6% of people will still be living in extreme poverty by 2030 if current trends continue. Francesca Perucci, chief statistician in the UN department of economic and social affairs, said an estimated 736 million people are still living in extreme poverty globally, including 413 million in sub-Saharan Africa. ""Extreme poverty today is concentrated and overwhelmingly affects rural populations,"" the report said. ""Increasingly, it is exacerbated by violent conflicts and climate change."" While Liu said there has been ""good progress"" on 16 of the UN goals, he said that ""there's been no good progress"" on ending hunger, which he called ""a tragedy for the international community."" He said the most direct impact of climate change is on agricultural production, a key factor in increasing hunger. According to the report, the number of people going hungry has increased since 2014. ""An estimated 821 million people were undernourished in 2017,"" up from 784 million in 2015 and the same number as in 2010, it said. The worst hit region is sub-Saharan Africa, where the number of undernourished people increased from 195 million in 2014 to 237 million in 2017, the report said. On education, it warned that proficiency in reading and mathematics is ""shockingly"" low. ""Globally, an estimated 617 million children and adolescents of primary and lower secondary school age - more than 55 per cent of the global total - lacked minimum proficiency in reading and mathematics in 2015."" The report said women represent 39% of the workforce but hold only 27% of managerial positions. It said 785 million people had no access to clean drinking water in 2017 while 673 million lacked good sanitation systems, the majority of them in southern Asia. Perucci said 80% of people worldwide are online, but only 45% of those living in developing countries and just 20% in the least developed countries have access to the internet. ""It is abundantly clear that a much deeper, faster and more ambitious response in needed to unleash the social and economic transformation needed to achieve our 2030 goals,"" UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres said in the report's forward.

Confirming a report in the New York Times, the defence ministry said in a statement that US-made Javelin missiles discovered in a camp south of Tripoli at the end of June had been purchased by France. But it denied supplying them to rebel commander Haftar and breaching a UN arms embargo, saying French forces operating in the war-torn country had lost track of them after they were judged to be defective. ""Damaged and out-of-use, these weapons were being temporarily stocked in a warehouse ahead of their destruction,"" the statement said. ""They were not transferred to local forces."" The anti-tank missiles, worth 170,000 dollars (150,000 euros) each, were seized when forces loyal to the UN-recognised government in Tripoli overran the rebel base in Gharyan, 100 kilometres (60 miles) south of Tripoli. Three of them, as well Chinese-made shells bearing the markings of the the United Arab Emirates (UAE), were shown off to journalists including AFP reporters on June 29. The statement from the French ministry did not explain how the missiles had been lost and will likely increase suspicions that Paris is backing Haftar on the ground, while also giving him diplomatic support internationally. France has publicly called for the UN arms embargo to be enforced, while an EU naval mission off the Libyan coast called Operation Sophia is trying to stop the flow of foreign weapons into the conflict. French special forces and members of its DGSE intelligence service are known to be operating in Libya, which descended into chaos after a 2011 uprising and NATO-backed military campaign against late dictator Moamer Kadhafi. ""These weapons were for the protection of forces undertaking intelligence and counter-terror missions,"" the French statement added. The Libyan conflict has drawn in a range of regional and international actors who are all competing for influence. Analysts say Haftar has been backed by Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt, Russia and France during offensives against Islamist militias that have brought most of the country under his control. But he has been branded a warlord and dictator-in-the-making by his opponents and on April 4 he launched an offensive on Tripoli seeking to overthrow the government of Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj. The fighting has claimed at least 1,000 lives and displaced tens of thousands of people. The UN-recognised government in Tripoli headed by Sarraj controls a much smaller amount of territory in the east and draws support from Turkey, Qatar and Italy, analysts say. In May, it posted pictures showing the arrival of Turkish BMC Kirpi armoured vehicles at Tripoli port. France's role in the conflict under President Emmanuel Macron has caused tensions. Macron threw himself into diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict after his elections in May 2017, seeing the instability across the Mediterranean as a major security worry and a source of migration to Europe. He invited Haftar along with Sarraj to a peace conference in Paris in 2017 which was seen as giving the rebel commander international legitimacy for the first time. The move also ruffled feathers in Italy, the former colonial power in Libya which had led European policy in the country until then. When Haftar launched his offensive on Tripoli in April, France was accused by Sarraj of being complicit in the violence which was condemned by the international community.

UN ambassadors from 22 states - including Australia, Britain, Canada, France, Germany and Japan - co-signed the text sent to the Human Rights Council president, Coly Seck, and the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet. China is reportedly holding one million people, mostly ethnic Uighurs, in internment camps in Xinjiang. Rights groups and former inmates describe them as ""concentration camps"" where mainly Muslim Uighurs and other minorities are being forcefully assimilated into China's majority ethnic Han society. The letter expresses concern ""about credible reports of arbitrary detention... as well as widespread surveillance and restrictions, particularly targeting Uighurs and other minorites in Xinjiang."" It calls on China to stop arbitrary detention and allow ""freedom of movement of Uighurs and other Muslim and minority communities in Xinjiang."" The authors, who include ambassadors from across the EU as well as Switzerland, requested that the letter become an official document of the Human Rights Council, which ends its 41st session in Geneva on Friday. Diplomats rarely send open letters to the 47-member council to criticise a country's record, but the move may have been the only available option to spotlight Xinjiang, with China likely having enough support to vote down a formal resolution. Chinese officials describe the camps as voluntary ""vocational education centres"" where Turkic-speaking Uighurs receive job training. Beijing has said the centres are necessary to steer people away from religious extremism, terrorism and separatism.

Ranil Wickremesinghe said the government was discussing a replacement for the 1995 Status of Forces (SOFA) arrangement that would allow the US military easier access to the strategically placed Indian Ocean island. The Prime Minister said negotiations were ongoing as the new document contained provisions Sri Lanka was ""not able to accept"", without elaborating on what they were. His comments came days after President Maithripala Sirisena said he would not let the government headed by his pro-West arch-rival conclude any deal giving US forces freer access to Sri Lanka. ""I will not allow the SOFA that seeks to betray the nation. Some foreign forces want to make Sri Lanka one of their bases. I will not allow them to come into the country and challenge our sovereignty,"" Sirisena, who faces an election this year, said at a rally last weekend. Wickremesinghe denied that the new SOFA would lead to a permanent US presence on the island. ""The US navy is not a fleet of fishing trawlers. They don't need any bases (in Sri Lanka),"" he said. The US and Sri Lankan militaries can already access each other's ports and airports under the 2007 Acquisition and Cross Servicing Agreement (ACSA). The United States last year granted $39 million for maritime security to Sri Lanka as China increases its presence in the strategic region. US concern has increased as China steps up investment in ports and other projects on the island, which is a key link in Beijing's ambitious ""Belt and Road"" infrastructure initiative. China has vowed to keep providing financial help, including loans, to Sri Lanka despite warnings about the nation's mounting debt. Sri Lanka in 2017 gave a 99-year lease on a strategic port to Beijing because it could not repay Chinese loans for the $1.4 billion project.

The verdict brought an end to a case that had shocked Germany, stoked debate about Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision to welcome almost 1 million asylum seekers from the Middle East and Africa, and prompted accusations of racism against the far right for playing up links between crime and foreigners. Ali Bashar, 22, arrived in Germany at the height of the 2015 crisis and was known to police for violent conduct before he raped and murdered Susanna Feldman. German authorities had rejected his asylum request. Prosecutors said he fled back to Iraq after strangling the teenager in May 2018 and was arrested and extradited to Germany by Iraqi authorities a month later. Wednesday's verdict by the court in the western German city of Wiesbaden means Bashar will have to serve at least 15 years in prison, after which he could seek parole. The high-profile case was used by the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party to bolster its assertions that the record arrival of migrants had triggered a rise in crime. Germany's mainstream parties accuse the anti-migrant AfD of racism for dwelling on migrant crime while ignoring police statistics showing that crime has been falling among both Germans and foreigners.

Hours after an enraged Trump virtually declared him a persona non grata in Washington, calling him a “stupid guy” and a “pompous fool,” Darroch sent in his resignation to the British foreign office saying his position had become untenable. ""Since the leak of official documents from this Embassy there has been a great deal of speculation surrounding my position and the duration of my remaining term as ambassador. I want to put an end to that speculation. The current situation is making it impossible for me to carry out my role as I would like,” Darroch wrote. “Although my posting is not due to end until the end of this year, I believe in the current circumstances the responsible course is to allow the appointment of a new ambassador,” he added. Foreign envoys posted in Washington DC routinely send assessments of the current political situation via diplomatic cables to their headquarters. But never before has such a report sparked public furor, least of all between two of the closest allies in the world, and seldom involving public chastisement of an envoy by the highest executive office. The fracas not only highlighted Trump’s now well-established hypersensitivity to any kind of criticism -- even in what is widely seen in the diplomatic community as boilerplate reports that ambassadors send home -- but also underscored Trump’s public intervention in British politics and the British right-wing Brexiteers embrace of Trump. The US President publicly berated the outgoing UK Prime Minister Theresa May for not listening to him on Brexit after virtually dictating who he would like London’s envoy to Washington to be. ""Many people would like to see @Nigel_Farage represent Great Britain as their Ambassador to the United States. He would do a great job!"" Trump had tweeted soon after he was elected in 2016, and that sentiment seemed to be part of the set-up that sent Darroch packing. Expectedly, Farage, who had helped Trump in the 2016 US Presidential elections, was quick to call for the sacking of the British envoy hours after the leaked cables. In fact, the scuttlebutt in the British diplomatic and journalistic community is that the cables were leaked deliberately to a pro-Brexit scribe close to Farage and published in a pro-Trump tabloid in order to shaft Darroch and pave the way for a successor who would be more aligned with the Trump dispensation. “It seems the deliberate leaking of Kim Darroch’s email was aimed at undermining him, so the new unelected Tory PM can appoint a Trumpian patsy to Washington. I wonder who might have been behind such a thing,” tweeted Ben Bradshaw, the Labor MP for Exeter. In fact, some reports have gone so far as to suggest that pro-Brexit politicians in UK are working in cahoots with Trump minions in Washington to purge career British officials who do not toe the Trexit-Brexit line that is broadly aimed at reversing the globalisation that has put the long-privileged and porly-educated nativist and isolationist bases at a disadvantage. Jonathan Powell, former prime minister Tony Blair’s chief of staff, told Britain’s Channel 4 News that the attempt to force Darroch from office followed similar efforts to punish career British officials suspected of insufficient enthusiasm for Brexit, according to The Intercept website. Pro-Brexit websites have also hailed Darroch's ouster. ""Britain's anti-Brexit ambassador to the US is what Donald Trump would call a ""bad hombre"".

Senior administration officials told The Associated Press that Trump is set to sign an executive order Wednesday calling for strategies that have the potential to save lives and millions of Medicare dollars. That won't happen overnight; some of the initiatives will require new government regulations. And because a severe organ shortage complicates the call for more transplants, the administration also aims to ease financial hardships for living donors, said the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity ahead of the announcement. Another key change: steps to help the groups that collect deceased donations do a better job. Officials cited a study that suggests long term it may be possible to find 17,000 more kidneys and 11,000 other organs from deceased donors for transplant every year. Federal health officials have made clear for months that they intend to shake up a system that today favors expensive, time-consuming dialysis in large centers over easier-to-tolerate at-home care or transplants that help patients live longer. ""Right now every financial incentive is toward dialysis and not toward transplantation and long-term survivorship,'' Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, whose father experienced traditional and at-home dialysis before getting a living donor transplant, told a Senate hearing in March. ``And you get what you pay for.'' About 30 million American adults have chronic kidney disease, costing Medicare a staggering $113 billion. Careful treatment, including control of diabetes and high blood pressure, the two main culprits, can help prevent further kidney deterioration. But more than 700,000 people have end-stage renal disease, meaning their kidneys have failed, and require either a transplant or dialysis to survive. Only about a third received specialized kidney care before they got so sick. More than 94,000 of the 113,000 people on the national organ waiting list need a kidney. Last year, there were 21,167 kidney transplants. A fraction (6,442) were from living donors, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing, which oversees the nation's transplant system. ""The longer you're on dialysis, the outcomes are worse,'' said Dr. Amit Tevar, a transplant surgeon at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, who praised the Trump administration initiatives being announced Wednesday. Too often, transplant centers don't see a kidney patient until they've been on dialysis for years, he said. And while any transplant is preferable, one from a living donor is best because those organs ``work better, longer and faster,'' Tevar said. Among the initiatives that take effect first: Medicare payment changes that would provide a financial incentive for doctors and clinics to help kidney patients stave off end-stage disease by about six months. A bonus to kidney specialists who help prepare patients for early transplant, with steps that can begin even before they need dialysis. Additional Medicare changes so that dialysis providers can earn as much by helping patients get dialysis at home as in the large centers that predominate today. Patients typically must spend hours three or four times a week hooked to machines that filter waste out of their blood. Home options include portable blood-cleansing machines, or what's called peritoneal dialysis that works through an abdominal tube, usually while patients are sleeping. Today, about 14% of patients in kidney failure get at-home dialysis or an early transplant. By 2025, the goal is to have 80% of people with newly diagnosed kidney failure getting one of those options, officials said. These changes are being implemented through Medicare's innovation center, created under the Obama-era Affordable Care Act and empowered to seek savings and improved quality. The Trump administration is relying on the innovation center even as it argues in federal court that the law that created it is unconstitutional and should be struck down entirely. Other initiatives will require new regulations, expected to be proposed later this year. Among them: Allowing reimbursement of lost wages and other expenses for living donors, who can give one of their kidneys or a piece of their liver. The transplant recipient's insurance pays the donor's medical bills. But they are out of work for weeks recuperating and one study found more than a third of living kidney donors reported lost wages, a median of $2,712, in the year following donation. Details about who pays and who qualifies still have to be worked out. Clearer ways to measure how well the nation's 58 organ procurement organizations collect donations from deceased donors. Some do a better job than others, but today's performance standards are self-reported, varying around the country and making it hard for government regulators or the OPOs themselves to take steps to improve. ""Some OPOs are very aggressive and move forward with getting organs allocated and donors consented, and there are those that are a little more lackadaisical about it,'' said Pittsburgh's Tevar. Unlike the medical advances in transplantation, ""we haven't really made big dents and progress and moves in increasing cadaveric organs or increasing live donor options.''

Chinese and Indian employees in Britain earn more than their white British counterparts, a new report has revealed. But employees of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin have the lowest hourly pay of all ethnicities, according to the report “Ethnicity Pay Gaps in Great Britain: 2018”. The report, which details for the first time earnings and employment statistics for different ethnic groups in Britain, was published by the Office for National Statistics on Tuesday. It found that employees from the Chinese and Indian ethnic groups have consistently earned more than white British employees since 2012. The two ethnic groups with the highest median hourly pay in Britain in 2018 were Chinese and Indian with Chinese earning 30.9% more than their white British counterparts’ hourly earnings at £15.75 (Rs 1,347) whilst ethnic Indian employees earn 12% more, with an average hourly pay of £13.47 (Rs 1,152). Those from mixed/multiple ethnic groups also earn more than white British with an average hourly pay of £12.33 (Rs 1,054). The median pay of white British employees stands at £12.03 (Rs 1,028) per hour. The ethnic group that has the lowest median hourly pay is Bangladeshi at £9.60 (Rs 821), 20.2% less than white British, followed by Pakistani at £10 (Rs 855) per hour, which is 16.9% less. The ethnicity pay gap data was commissioned as part of a UK government examination into the barriers faced by people from ethnic minority groups in the workplace which followed a 2017 report, “Race in the Workplace”, which stated that equal progression across ethnicities could be worth an additional £24 billion (a little over Rs 2 lakh crore) to the UK’s economy per year. Despite being at the top, the largest pay difference between males and females in 2018 was for the Indian ethnic group, with Indian men earning 23.3% more per hour than Indian women compared to Chinese men who earn 19.1% more per hour than Chinese women, and white British men who earn 18.5% more than white British women. Bangladeshi women, on the contrary, earn 10.5% more than Bangladeshi men, the report found. The ethnic group with the highest employment rate is white other (such as white Australian and white European) at 81.7%, followed by white British at 76.4 %, with Indian in third place, ahead of Chinese at 75.9%. The two ethnic groups with the lowest employment rates are Pakistani and Bangladeshi, with employment rates of 58.2% and 54.9%, respectively, and the inactivity rates of women in the Pakistani and Bangladeshi ethnic groups are substantially higher than that of any other ethnic group. Pratik Dattani, MD of economic research firm EPG, based in London and India, said: “As there are four times as many Indians as Chinese in Britain, the data underlines the substantial, unmatched value that Indians create for the British economy.” Jasvir Singh, founding chair of City Sikhs, said: “Having the breakdown regarding the ethnic pay gap is extremely useful, but it doesn’t paint the full picture when it comes to the representation at senior levels of all industries. For example, whilst Chinese and Indian heritage people may be paid more on average than other ethnic backgrounds, recent research has shown that there are more people called ‘Steve’ heading FTSE 100 companies than there are individuals from ethnic minorities. Also, the majority of FTSE 100 companies have no ethnic minority board group members whatsoever. Much more needs to be done to ensure that people from all backgrounds are supported in the workplace and are able to reach all levels within their respective industries.” Indian origin self-made millionaire Rami Ranger said: “Citizens of ancient civilisations, namely India and China, are working very hard for Britain and getting rewarded accordingly.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."|"Indians and Chinese earn more than white British counterparts: UK report"|"Wed Jul 10 23:22:00 CEST 2019"|"[world]"

The hormone regulates labour and fundamental social behaviours such as maternal care, partnership bonding, social interactions, and stress and anxiety responses. ""The downside to oxytocin is that it activates a number of receptors, some of which can lead to unwanted side effects,"" said Markus Muttenthaler from University of Queensland in Australia. ""For example, oxytocin is used to progress labour but it can have serious side effects such as cardiovascular problems or uterine rupture when used for too long or at a too-high dose,"" said Muttenthaler. The team created a new molecule by introducing small modifications to the structure of oxytocin, which reduced the activity of receptors linked to some side effects. ""The new compound we have developed is just as potent as oxytocin, but shows improved selectivity for the oxytocin receptor, potentially reducing dangerous side effects,"" said Muttenthaler.

The wreck of the Komsomolets lies on the bottom of the Norwegian Sea at a depth of about 1,700 metres (5,577 feet). Authorities have conducted yearly expeditions to monitor radiation levels since the 1990s but this year's inspection was the first one to use a remotely operated vehicle called Aegir 6000 to film the wreckage and take samples which will be further analysed. The scientific mission's samples show levels of radioactivity at the site up to 800,000 higher than normal, the Norwegian Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority said in a statement. ""This is of course a higher level than we would usually measure out at sea but the levels we have found now are not alarming,"" said expedition leader Hilde Elise Heldal of the Norwegian Institute of Marine Research. Radioactivity levels ""thin out"" quickly at these depths and there are few fish in the area, she said. The Komsomolets sank on April 7, 1989, after a fire broke out on board, killing 42 crew. On July 1, 14 Russian sailors were killed aboard a nuclear submarine operating in the Arctic.

Merkel earlier shook back and forth as she stood outside and looked uncomfortable as she watched a military ceremony marking the arrival of visiting Finnish Prime Minister Antti Rinne, who stood by her side. After the first shaking episode, when she met visiting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on June 18, Merkel said she felt better after drinking some water. ""I am fine,"" Merkel told a news conference after Wednesday's meeting with Rinne. ""I have recently said that I am working through what happened during the military honours with President Zelenskiy."" ""This process is clearly not finished yet but there is progress and I must live with this for a while but I am very well and you don't need to worry about me,"" she added. ""I believe that just as it happened one day, so it will disappear. Otherwise I am convinced that I am quite capable (of doing my job),"" she said. Merkel's office has given no explanation for the shaking episodes, prompting speculation in German media about the cause. The chancellor, 64 and in office since 2005, has no history of serious health issues. She was also seen shaking on June 27 when she met German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier but her spokesman said she was fine and she later went ahead with her planned trip to Japan for a G20 summit. A government official told Reuters at the time that that was more a psychological issue as she tried desperately to avoid a repeat. After her Japan trip, Merkel went straight into three days of tortuous talks in Brussels to decide on a new group of nominees for top European Union jobs - a package that has strained her coalition government. Merkel is renowned for her work ethic and has a reputation for outlasting other leaders at EU summits with her ability to focus on the details of complex discussions deep into the night. In November 2016, when announcing that she would seek a fourth term as chancellor, Merkel said: ""It is a decision not just for an election campaign but about the next four years ... if health allows it."" Were Merkel to be incapacitated, Steinmeier would appoint a cabinet minister as acting chancellor until parliament elects a new chancellor. This need not be Vice Chancellor Olaf Scholz, a member of the Social Democrats - junior partner in Merkel's ruling grand coalition. In the past, Merkel has joked that she is a ""sleep camel"" who can go days with just a few hours of sleep as long as she gets a full night of sleep at the weekend. She is due to go on holiday later in the summer. Merkel has loomed large on the European stage since 2005, helping guide the EU through the euro zone crisis and opening Germany's doors in 2015 to migrants fleeing war in the Middle East - a move that still divides the bloc and her country.

Hassan Rouhani was quoted by the official IRNA news agency as calling the seizure ""mean and wrong'' during a Cabinet meeting. ""You are an initiator of insecurity and you will understand its repercussions,'' he warned the British government, calling for the ""full security'' of international shipping lanes. The tanker's detention comes at a particularly sensitive time as tensions between the US and Iran grow over the unraveling of the 2015 nuclear deal, from which President Donald Trump withdrew last year. In recent weeks, Iran has begun to openly breach limits on uranium enrichment set by the deal in order to pressure European signatories to salvage it. Foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif meanwhile denied the supertanker belonged to Iran, saying whoever owned the oil shipment and the vessel could pursue the case through legal avenues. Iran had earlier summoned the British ambassador over what it called the ""illegal interception'' of the ship. The latest US-Iranian tensions date back to last year, when Trump withdrew from the nuclear accord and restored heavy sanctions on Iran, including its oil industry, exacerbating an economic crisis that has sent the currency plummeting. A senior Iranian security official said Wednesday that Iran will not reverse its decision to increase uranium enrichment beyond the limits set by the accord until it achieves its ""full rights'' under the deal. Ali Shamkhani told a French envoy that the decision to increase enrichment is an ""unchangeable strategy'' and criticized European countries for their ``lack of will'' in providing relief from U.S. sanctions, according to the official IRNA news agency. France and other countries have called on Iran to go back to complying with the nuclear deal. Emmanuel Bonne, a French presidential envoy, is in Iran this week for talks aimed at resolving the crisis. In the deal with world powers negotiated by the Obama administration, Iran had agreed to curb its nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief. It has offered to return to the agreement, but Trump has long rejected the deal, saying it was too generous to Tehran and did not address its involvement in regional conflicts. In May, the United States dispatched a carrier group, bombers and fighter jets to the Persian Gulf region in response to alleged Iranian threats. The U.S. has accused Iran of involvement in the bombing of oil tankers in the Gulf and says it shot down an American drone in international airspace. Iran denies any involvement in the attacks on the tankers and says the drone had veered into its airspace. Iran is a key ally of Syrian President Bashar Assad's government, which is under Western sanctions linked to attacks on civilians during the country's civil war.

On Tuesday, Lam described the bill, which would have allowed people in Hong Kong, with its cherished rule of law, to be sent to mainland China for trial and pave the way for assets to be confiscated, as ""dead"". But activists and protest groups said they could not trust her words and are increasing demands for her to officially withdraw the bill and step down. And they are vowing further action, after weeks of huge and at times violent street protests that have plunged the city into its worst crisis since Britain handed it back to Chinese rule in 1997. On Saturday, some groups will spread their message to mainland traders in a New Territories village near the city's border with China - a step seen as a further provocation of Communist Party leaders in Beijing. And while Lam, a self-styled ""Iron Lady"", has vowed to stay on, her latest statements have only fuelled speculation that she has already offered to quit. When asked about whether she would honour demands that she resign just two years into her first five-year term, Lam said that it was ""not a simple thing for a CE (chief executive) to step down"". ""I myself still have the passion and undertaking to service Hong Kong people,"" Lam said. For some analysts, Lam's statement was a sign that she may have already tendered her resignation. But Beijing will only let her go when the time is right. ""It is more complex than ordinary people assume... You can't just quit when you like and walk away when it comes to dealing with Beijing,"" said political scientist and commentator Sonny Lo. Beijing leaders, he said, had to weigh domestic and regional risks and find a replacement - no easy task for a job widely seen as a poisoned chalice, weighing Hong Kong's cherished freedoms and the Communist Party's authoritarian instincts. Under the handover deal with Britain, Hong Kong was allowed to retain extensive freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland under a ""one country, two systems"" formula, including its independent judiciary and right to protest. Beijing might want Lam to at least repair some of the damage caused by the extradition bill fiasco before leaving to help any successor, but would almost certainly want her gone before Legislative Council elections in September next year, Lo said. Already Hong Kong's pro-Beijing camp is showing signs of splits amid the fallout of Lam's championing of the extradition bill, which sparked a broad range of criticism from within establishment circles. In the shorter term, some diplomats and analysts believe Beijing will not want to further dent the image of ""one country, two systems"" ahead of presidential elections in neighbouring self-ruled Taiwan in January. Beijing leaders have started again touting ""one country, two systems"" as a model for Taiwan, which they consider a wayward province. Taiwan has rejected the offer. Ming Sing, an associate professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, said he believed that Beijing was not letting Lam step down. ""If she resigns right now, if she is compelled by Beijing to resign, that would send a very strong signal to Hong Kong and the international community that Beijing, the largest one-party state, the largest authoritarian state in the world, would back down in the face of popular pressure,"" he said. Even so, some analysts and diplomats note Lam has already harmed the broader national security agenda of Chinese President Xi Jinping, making it harder to introduce any new security-related laws in Hong Kong and refreshing calls for democratic reforms. Hong Kong lawmaker Fernando Cheung told Reuters that Lam was now a lame duck who will not be able to complete her term. ""How the government and the chief executive handled the outcry from the public also made a lot of people aware that without true democracy, there is no hope for accountable governance,"" the Labour Party legislator said. ""So once the awareness is there, there is no return."" With protest placards declaring that ""Bloody Carrie"" Lam had ""sold Hong Kong"" and with her popularity ratings lower than any other post-handover leader, recent weeks have marked a swift reversal of fortune for a leader who took office vowing to unite the city. For many, her fate now echoes that of Hong Kong's first post-handover leader, Tung Chee-hwa. Tung offered to step down immediately after half a million people took to the streets in 2003 to protest against proposed national security laws, which were also eventually shelved. It would not be until nearly two years later - mid-way through his second term - that he was able to finally leave. ""To go away is easy,"" he said at the time. ""To stay is much harder.""

Norman Lasuca and one other yet to be identified suspect blew themselves up outside a military camp on the remote southern island of Jolo on June 28 in an attack that also killed three soldiers and two civilians, the police and military said. ""We can now confirm... the incidence of the first suicide bombing in the Philippines, perpetrated by a Filipino in the person of Norman Lasuca,"" military spokesman Brigadier General Edgard Arevalo told a news conference. The Jolo bombing marks a worrying escalation of militancy driven by the influence of the Islamic State group in Southeast Asia, security experts earlier told AFP. A decades-old Islamist insurgency in the southern Philippines has killed tens of thousands. But suicide attacks have been used extremely rarely, with foreign fighters blamed for the few that have been carried out. National police spokesman Bernard Banac described last month's bombing as ""a locally initiated attack organised by the Abu Sayyaf group"", a Jolo-based gang of militants engaged in kidnappings and bombings. ""The report as claimed by ISIS that they are the ones responsible for this is still up to validation and that remains to be seen,"" he told reporters, referring to IS by an alternative name. Philippine authorities said the two suspected Jolo bombers' remains were tested for DNA, and one matched that of Lasuca's mother and brother, who are both Tausugs, the predominant Muslim ethnic group in Jolo. Experts are still attempting to identify the second bomber, Banac said. ""Before, we only heard of IED (improvised explosive device) attacks, remote-controlled attacks but this time an individual blew himself up as a full-fledged suicide bomber,"" Arevalo said. ""We (security forces) will have adjustments in techniques, tactics and procedures given this development,"" he said. ""We consider this to be an isolated case,"" he added. However, he acknowledged that ""the security environment in our country has changed"" and civilians should help the security forces combat the new threat. They must ensure prospective recruits ""won't be radicalised by terrorist groups (who are) only waiting for the right time and individual to bring to the road of extremism,"" he said. Arevalo said Lasuca's mother described the son, in his early twenties, as a former ""battered"" child who endured beatings meted out by his father.

General Charles Etienne Gudin, whose name is inscribed on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, died aged 44 on August 22, 1812, after being hit by a cannon ball during Napoleon's unsuccessful invasion of Russia. Gudin was personally known to and respected by Napoleon, and after his death his heart was cut out and carried to Paris to be placed in a chapel in the French capital's Pere Lachaise cemetery. A bust of his likeness resides in the Palace of Versailles, and a Paris street bears his name. A team of French and Russian archaeologists say they discovered what they believe to be Gudin's missing remains on July 6 during a dig in the Russian city of Smolensk, 400 km (250 miles) west of Moscow. Records from the period indicate that Gudin's battlefield injuries meant he had to have his left leg amputated and also suffered damage to his right leg. Archaeologists say the remains which they found in a coffin are consistent with those injuries and believe ""with a high degree of probability"" that they have found the aristocrat and veteran of both the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars. French historian and archaeologist Pierre Malinovsky, who played a central role in the discovery, has hailed the find as the culmination of a long search. ""It's a historic moment not only for me but for I think for our two countries,"" Malinovsky told Smolensk newspaper Rabochy Put (Worker's Journey), saying Napoleon had personally known Gudin since his childhood. ""Napoleon was one of the last people to see him alive which is very important, and he's the first general from the Napoleonic period that we have found."" The Russian military-historical society, which was also involved in the dig, said the find, if confirmed, would be a sensation. ""It's possible that we'll have to identify the remains with the aid of a DNA test which could take from several months to a year,"" it said. ""The general's descendants are following the news.""

Immigration officials were failing to adequately support those escaping slavery and risked adding to their trauma by locking them up, found a report from After Exploitation, which used Freedom of Information requests to obtain the data. ""All too often victims of trafficking are perceived as immigration offenders rather than victims,"" said Pierre Makhlouf, assistant director at charity Bail for Immigration Detainees, in response to the report. The Home Office (interior ministry) said no one who said they had been trafficked would be required to leave the country while their claim was being considered and that a victim's status was considered when deciding their immigration case. ""Detention is an important part of the immigration system – but it must be fair, dignified and protect the most vulnerable,"" a spokeswoman told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""We have made significant improvements to our approach in recent years, but remain committed to going further."" People who are recognised as likely victims of modern slavery are entitled to a package of support including housing, counselling and some living costs while their case is assessed under Britain's National Referral Mechanism (NRM) scheme. However, victims of trafficking do not have any automatic entitlement to remain in Britain and they can be detained in some circumstances in order to carry out their removal. A total of 507 people were recognised as probable slavery victims under the NRM either before they were first detained or while being held in 2018, the data showed. In all, 2,726 people were recognised as likely slavery victims in 2017 - the most recent official data available - suggesting up to a fifth had been held under immigration rules at some point, said the authors. Charities providing support in detention centres report that vulnerable people often lack adequate access to healthcare, mental health support and legal services, the report said, putting slavery victims at risk of further harm. The Home Office said 479 people were already in detention when they were officially recognised as probable slavery victims, and nearly 90% were then released within a week. The data showed officials had either allowed known potential victims to be detained or had failed to recognise the signs of trafficking, the report said. It called for anyone who was referred to the NRM to be automatically released from detention. ""We strongly urge the government to acknowledge and address the frequency with which vulnerable people are detained,"" said Maya Esslemont from After Exploitation. Britain's parliament will host a debate on immigration detention of survivors of trafficking and slavery on Tuesday, led by Jess Philips, a lawmaker for the opposition Labour party. At least 13,000 people in Britain are estimated by the government to be victims of forced labour, sexual exploitation and domestic servitude. Police say the true figure could be in the tens of thousands.

A public outcry over revelations that journalists on tabloid newspapers hacked into phones to find stories prompted Murdoch to shut down his News of the World newspaper in 2011. Mills said the settlement from the company, which also publishes The Sun newspaper, stemmed from activity carried out between 1999 and 2010. The amount of the settlement was not disclosed. Ben Silverstone, representing News Group Newspapers, said the company offered its ""sincere apologies"" to Mills and her sister for the distress caused to them by individuals working for or on behalf of News of the World. ""The defendant accepts that such activity should never have taken place and that it had no right to intrude into the private lives of Ms Heather Mills or Fiona Mills in this way,"" he said. The Mills sisters claimed that they experienced ""strange activity with their telephones, journalists and photographers turning up in unexpected locations"" and the publication of private information ""without any apparent identifiable source"", according to a statement read in court. The repeated publication of such information ""caused a lot of distrust and suspicion"" that a friend or family member was ""betraying them and selling stories to the press"", the statement said. The sisters' claims were settled on the basis that News Group Newspapers made no admission of liability in relation to their allegations of phone hacking at The Sun.

The sculpture is a replica of a colossal 3,000-year-old statue from the Temple of Ishtar in Nimrud, in what’s now Iraq. The stone statue was one of many artifacts from the Mosul Museum destroyed by the Islamic State terror group after it overran the city in 2014. The replica Lion of Mosul, which can be viewed online, was modelled from crowd-sourced photos taken by Mosul Museum visitors in happier times and 3D printed as part of Google’s digital arts and culture project. It’s going on display at London’s Imperial War Museum in an exhibition that looks at how war devastates societies’ cultural fabric — and at the ingenious and often heroic steps taken to preserve it. “The destruction of culture is sort of an accepted sideline to war,” Imperial War Museum curator Paris Agar said. “One of the main reasons for destroying culture is to send a message: We have victory over you. We have power over you. It’s because culture means so much to us; if we didn’t care it wouldn’t be a tool.” The most shocking parts of the exhibition are the records made by the destroyers: meticulous Nazi lists of artworks they’d stolen; video of the Taliban blowing up Afghanistan’s 1,000-yearold Bamiyan Buddhas; footage of IS militants methodically sledgehammering statues in the Mosul museum. The show covers a century of destruction, from the German army’s World War I destruction of the university and library of Louvain, Belgium to the shelling of the National and University Library in Sarajevo during the Bosnian war in 1992.

The US President took to Twitter to attack Kim Darroch as a ""very stupid guy"" after disinviting him from an event at the White House on Monday night in retaliation. In a renewed attack on Darroch on Tuesday, Trump said: ""The wacky Ambassador that the UK foisted upon the United States is not someone we are thrilled with, a very stupid guy.

His latest interventions on social media came as the diplomatic row continued to rumble on. In a direct attack on May, the US President repeated his claim that he had told her how to handle Brexit but ""she went her own foolish way-was unable to get it done. A disaster!"" ""I don't know the Ambassador but have been told he is a pompous fool. Tell him the USA now has the best Economy & Military anywhere in the World, by far... and they are both only getting bigger, better and stronger,"" reads his Twitter attack. ....and they are both only getting bigger, better and stronger.....Thank you, Mr. President! &mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 1562672885000 Earlier, Downing Street was firm that the beleaguered diplomat had the PM's full support and that envoys must have the freedom to provide honest assessments of the politics in their country of posting. ""We have made clear to the US how unfortunate this leak is. The selective extracts leaked do not reflect the closeness of, and the esteem in which we hold, the relationship,"" said a Downing Street spokesperson. ""The UK has a special and enduring relationship with the US based on our long history and commitment to shared values and that will continue to be the case,"" the spokesperson said. The scandal broke out over the weekend when classified emails from Darroch to a range of UK government officials emerged in the media. Trump launched a tirade against the diplomat as ""not liked or well thought of within the US"" and that he would ""no longer deal with him"". His characteristic social media attack extended to May, as he tweeted: ""I have been very critical about the way the UK and Prime Minister Theresa May handled Brexit."" ""What a mess she and her representatives have created. I told her how it should be done, but she decided to go another way."" In some of his communications leaked to the 'Mail on Sunday', Darroch, who became ambassador to the US in January 2016 about a year before Trump took office, questioned whether the White House at the time ""will ever look competent"" but also warned that the US President should not be written off. The emails, dating from 2017, said rumours of ""infighting and chaos"" in the White House were mostly true, the White House under Trump was ""uniquely dysfunctional"" and that the policy on sensitive issues such as Iran was ""incoherent, chaotic"". Conservative Party MP Tom Tugendhat, Chairman of the Commons' Foreign Affairs Committee, told British MPs that he has written to Scotland Yard to explore an investigation into the leak. The Metropolitan Police confirmed it had received Tugendhat's request but had not received an official governmental referral of allegations in relation to the UK's Official Secrets Act. A Met Police spokesperson said that it would require the ""referral"" for any criminal investigation to be considered. While the US State Department has not officially commented on the issue, Darooch has been disinvited from a dinner held at the White House on Monday night for the Emir of Qatar. UK foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt, one of two British Prime Ministerial hopefuls alongside former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, has also backed the ambassador, saying that it was important for diplomats to be able to give frank views to ministers. He warned ""very serious consequences"" for whoever was responsible for the leak, should they be discovered. ""In terms of the emails that have been leaked they are two years apart - one cluster very recent and one of two years ago,"" UK foreign office minister Alan Duncan told MPs. ""So it is not quite right to say they have been leaked consistently throughout that period. But of course we don't know if there are any others in the wrong hands which might subsequently be leaked,"" he said, adding that the Cabinet Office would ""use all of the means it can to delve into this and try find a culprit"".

Members of the lower house of parliament voted by 434 in favour to 33 against to adopt the law, which is modelled on German legislation that came into force last year. Sixty-nine MPs abstained. Sites that fail to comply with the law and remove ""obviously hateful"" content risk fines of up to 1.25 million euros ($1.4 million). The upper-house Senate will now examine the legislation, and could suggest amendments. A series of tech giants, including Facebook and YouTube, announced crackdowns on hateful and violent content in recent months, spurring calls for tougher regulation. Governments accused online platforms of not doing enough to stamp out hate speech in a Paris summit in May after a gunman broadcast his attack on two New Zealand mosques live on Facebook via a head-mounted camera. The footage was shared millions of times despite efforts to remove it. ""We must ensure the safety and protection of people online, especially the most vulnerable,"" said Laetitia Avia, a black MP who drafted the bill. She told parliament last week she suffers so many racist insults on Twitter that she once thought an abuse-free day was due to a technical problem. Critics say the law places too much power in the platforms' hands by making them arbiters of online speech. Social media giant Facebook has questioned whether the 24-hour window to remove hateful content is realistic, saying many posts require careful analysis and tricky legal assessment. MPs debated long into the night last week to try to agree on what constitutes ""obviously hateful"" messages or videos. They agreed to include condoning crimes against humanity. But amendments seeking to integrate specific references to anti-Zionism and hate against the state of Israel were rejected and did not make the final text.

Qiao Jianjun, a former official of the Chinese state grain administration, is wanted by Beijing under a sweeping government campaign against corruption. He is accused of having embezzled over 200 million yuan ($29 million or 26 million euros), according to documents from Chinese authorities provided to Sweden. Qiao contests the accusations against him and claims he has been in Beijing's sights since joining the ""China Democracy Party"" in 2010. ""He denies the crimes and is only being hunted by Chinese authorities because they think he isn't faithful to the (Communist) party,"" his lawyer, Henrik Olsson Lilja, told AFP. The Swedish top court said that there was a ""real risk"" that the accused could be sentenced to death, and assurances otherwise by Chinese authorities could not be given enough weight to justify extradition. ""The Supreme Court makes the assessment that there is a risk that he will be subjected to persecution because of his political activity and that he will be subjected to treatment in violation of the European Convention on Human Rights,"" Justice Petter Asp said in a statement. ""Under these conditions, extradition cannot take place,"" he added. The Swedish government officially makes the final decision on extradition matters, but it is obliged to follow the Supreme Court's rulings. During a press briefing in Beijing on Tuesday Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang reiterated an earlier statement that China hopes that Sweden would ""face up to the facts of Qiao Jianjun's crime"" and ""not become a safe haven for criminals"". ""China attaches great importance to the protection and promotion of human rights,"" Geng added. Qiao was originally arrested and detained in Sweden in June 2018 at China's request. He was released on 19 June 2019 only to be again arrested a week later in another case, this time at the behest of the US, whose authorities suspect him of money laundering in 2015. Sweden has given the US until August 2 to submit a more detailed account of the crimes he is suspected of before it decides on a potential extradition. According to court documents, Qiao started travelling between China and the US after gaining a US visa in 2009. He decided to permanently leave China in 2011 after joining the ""China Democracy Party"" and moved to the US with his family. Later he moved to Austria and then to Sweden in 2014 together with his new wife, who is an Austrian citizen. The couple have a two-year-old child, which according to his lawyer has made his detention unbearable. ""This has been a nightmarish year for him,"" Olsson Lilja said. In March this year Qiao applied for asylum in Sweden, but Swedish authorities have not yet made a decision. Diplomatic relations between China and Sweden have been strained over a number of incidents in recent years. The two countries have for instance been at odds over the arrest of Gui Minhai, a Chinese-born Swedish citizen known for publishing gossipy titles about Chinese political leaders out of a Hong Kong book shop. In 2018 a video showing Swedish police removing three Chinese tourists from a hotel in Stockholm was published online, which the Chinese embassy characterised as ""brutal abuse"" of the officers. The row escalated when Swedish comedian Jesper Ronndahl produced a satirical information video for Chinese tourists and published it on Chinese social media site Youku. Outrage, rather than laughter, ensued and the Chinese foreign ministry called the video a ""gross insult to and vicious attack on China and the Chinese people"".

Prosecutors allege Princess Hessa bint Salman became enraged when she saw the plumber allegedly capturing her image, fearing the pictures could be used to harm her as the Saudi monarch's daughter due to her country's conservative traditions. The presiding judge, quoting from prosecution evidence, said on the trial's opening day that the princess allegedly told her bodyguard to disparage the workman, calling him a ""dog who doesn't deserve to live."" Bint Salman, who is the older half-sister of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has denied the allegations through her lawyer. The French-Egyptian plumber, Ashraf Eid, told Paris police after the September 2016 incident that the bodyguard tied him up at the princess' bidding after he photographed a room to help in returning furniture to its original layout once he finished his work. ""The princess noticed that her face was reflected in the bathroom and that she had been filmed. She called me a dog and called her bodyguard saying in Arabic, This one, take his phone. He filmed me,'' Eid reported to police investigators. Eid said bodyguard Rani Saida broke his phone and also made him kiss the Saudi princess' feet while his hands were bound behind his back. The plumber did not attend court Tuesday. Saida is being tried together with the princess. He denies being physically aggressive, but said it's widely known no one is supposed to photograph the princess and alleged Eid ""knew very well what he had done."" ""There are 20 or 30 witnesses inside the apartment who can testify that at no time was (the workman) touched,"" he said, adding that breaking Eid's phone was ""the biggest mistake."" ""It deprives us showing that this gentleman took videos intentionally,"" Saidi said. Bint Salman left France days after the Sept. 26, 2016 incident and a warrant for her arrest was issued in December 2017. She was not present in court Tuesday. The princess is being tried for alleged theft of a telephone, complicity in voluntary violence and complicity in sequestration, according to a French judicial official who was not authorized to speak publicly and asked to remain anonymous. French daily newspaper Le Parisien quoted bint Salman's lawyer, Emmanuel Moyne, as saying the princess could not appear in court for her safety and because Saudi law prohibits the taking of her photograph.

He urged European countries to sanction Iran in response. On Monday, Iran breached the enrichment cap as it seeks to press other parties into keeping their side of the bargain under the nuclear deal. Netanyahu opposed the accord and urged US President Donald Trump to withdraw from it, which he eventually did. Despite having opposed the deal, Netanyahu is now calling on European nations to enforce its parameters as he and the United States seek to further pressure Iran.

The Istanbul public prosecutor said it issued arrest warrants for 176 active duty military personnel, including a colonel, five majors and 100 lieutenants from the different armed forces over alleged links to Muslim preacher Fethullah Gulen's movement. Turkey says US-based Gulen ordered the failed overthrow of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan but he vehemently denies the charges. The Izmir public prosecutor in the Aegean region issued arrest warrants for 35 suspects including 20 soldiers on active duty and 10 civilians, state news agency Anadolu said. The agency said eight suspects had been detained already. In the northwestern province of Kocaeli, the prosecutor sought the arrest of 17 suspects including nine current and former soldiers across seven cities, Anadolu reported. Authorities have detained tens of thousands of individuals since 2016, and the raids show no sign of slowing with almost daily reports of arrest warrants issued despite criticism from Western allies and rights defenders. Critics say the government is using the purge to crackdown on dissent but Turkish officials stress the raids are necessary to eradicate Gulen's influence in state bodies.

Malaysia is home to tens of thousands of Rohingya Muslims, who have for years arrived in the Southeast Asian nation from Myanmar or Bangladesh seeking asylum. More than 700,000 Rohingya refugees fled western Myanmar for Bangladesh, U.N. agencies say, after insurgents attacked Myanmar security forces in August 2017, triggering a sweeping army-led crackdown. Both of the Rohingya suspects were detained for providing support to the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), the insurgent group said to be behind the 2017 attacks, Malaysia's Inspector General of Police Abdul Hamid Bador said in a statement. One of the suspects, a 41-year-old construction worker, had also issued a death threat against Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in a video uploaded on social media, Abdul Hamid said. Other suspects detained included a 54-year-old Philippine national with alleged ties to Abu Sayyaf, a militant organisation aligned with the Islamic State. The man is also suspected of being involved in kidnapping activities in the waters of Sabah state, south of the Philippines, Abdul Hamid said. The fourth suspect was a 24-year-old Indian national who had allegedly acted as a facilitator to a senior member of Babbar Khalsa International (BKI), a Sikh separatist group. The suspect, a lift maintenance worker, is accused of transferring 7,600 ringgit ($1,835) to fund BKI's activities in Southeast Asia, Abdul Hamid said. Malaysia has been on high alert since gunmen allied with Islamic State carried out a series of attacks in Jakarta, the capital of neighbouring Indonesia, in January 2016.

Trucks full of white-gloved People's Liberation Army soldiers rolled into Hong Kong within hours of Britain handing its colony back to Chinese rule in 1997, sparking anxiety and raising lingering questions about their role. Major General Chen Daoxiang was speaking at the start of a meeting last month with David Helvey, principal deputy assistant secretary of defence for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs, according to people briefed on the discussion. Helvey met Chen on a courtesy call at in the PLA’s Hong Kong headquarters on June 13 – just metres from where a day earlier police clashed violently with protesters seeking to prevent the passing of a now-suspended bill that would allow people to be extradited to mainland China for trial. Protests and violence have continued since, including some activists smashing their way into the legislature on July 1, daubing the debating chamber in graffiti. ""Major-General Chen made it clear from the outset that the PLA would not breach their long-standing principle of non-interference in Hong Kong affairs,"" one source briefed on the discussions told Reuters. ""It was surprising, because he took it upon himself to raise it. It was a clear signal, coming at a sensitive time."" A U.S. defence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that Chen and a senior Pentagon official met. ""Major-General Chen did mention that during a conversation last week,"" the U.S. defence official said. ""I can’t provide any more context to the conversation in that it was private, between the two leaders."" A source with ties to the Chinese military said there were no plans for PLA involvement at the moment. ""This is a Hong Kong matter for the Hong Kong government to resolve,"" said the source, who meets regularly with senior officers. The Chinese Defence Ministry and the PLA Hong Kong garrison did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment. The role of the PLA in Hong Kong has long been one of the most sensitive elements of the handover – and a presence closely watched by activists and foreign diplomats. Some in the city fear the troops could be unleashed to quell violence but police chiefs have insisted their forces are capable of maintaining order. Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule with a guarantee of its freedoms, including the right to protest and an independent judiciary not enjoyed on the mainland, for at least 50 years. Under its mini-constitution, the Basic Law, defence and foreign affairs are managed by Communist Party leaders in Beijing. The Basic Law states that Hong Kong can request the garrison's assistance to maintain public order but ""they shall not interfere in local affairs"". They must abide by local laws, which are governed by the independent judiciary. VERY HIGH THRESHOLD Chinese laws allow for the standing committee of China's parliament, the National People's Congress, to deploy the garrison if a state of war or emergency is declared for Hong Kong, citing ""turmoil"" that threatened national security that was ""beyond the control of the (Hong Kong) government"". Legal scholars say that is a very high threshold while some retired security officials say any involvement by PLA units in Hong Kong security would shatter the ""one country, two systems"" formula under which Hong Kong returned to China. They would also expect police to secure any PLA facilities targeted by protesters. Regina Ip, a member of the Hong Kong government's leading advisory body and a former security chief, said despite ""dangerous provocations"" from some protesters, there was no appetite among Beijing or Hong Kong leaders for the PLA to become involved. The bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters on June 4, 1989, in and around Beijing's Tiananmen Square had been a ""millstone"" on Chinese leaders for three decades and they remained sensitive to international criticism, she said. ""I think the current leadership are smart enough to avoid this,"" she said. A second U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the United States noted the Chinese garrison's low profile. ""If they got to the point where the PLA had to intervene in Hong Kong, it would be a significant admission that they've lost control."" While acknowledging the likely reticence of Beijing deploying the PLA in Hong Kong, security analyst Derek Grossman of the U.S.-based RAND Corporation said there could be no guarantees if protests challenged the core interests of President Xi Jinping and his team. ""The Hong Kong garrison might seem like a symbolic presence, but the bottom line is that you can never really be sure they won't be used, particularly if things start to move in a whole new direction, such as inspiring protest action on the mainland,"" he said. Foreign envoys estimate the strength of the Hong Kong garrison at between 8,000 and 10,000, with troops in bases on both sides of the border. It includes a small naval and air force attachment. While they stage frequent drills, they are seldom seen outside of their bases. The PLA still occupies bases formerly used by the British across the territory, including several prime sites on Hong Kong island and across the harbour in Kowloon. The British-built PLA headquarters, topped by a large neon red and gold star, flanks key government offices and the city's legislature – a key target of recent protests.

Cash-strapped Pakistan, which currently has a currency reserve of less than $8 billion — enough to cover only 1.7 months of imports — approached the Washington-based International Monetary Fund (IMF) in August 2018 for a bailout package after the Imran Khan government took over. The global lender last week formally approved the $6 billion loan to Pakistan, which is facing ""significant"" economic challenges on the back of ""large"" fiscal and financial needs and ""weak and unbalanced"" growth. ""Pakistan is facing significant economic challenges on the back of large fiscal and financial needs and weak and unbalanced growth,"" David Lipton, First Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair of the IMF Executive Board said. Last week, the IMF approved the 13th bailout package for Pakistan since the late 1980s. The latest bailout package is worth $6 billion, of which $1 billion is to be disbursed immediately and the rest in the next three years. A decisive fiscal consolidation is key to reducing the large public debt and building resilience, and the adoption of the fiscal year 2020 budget is an important initial step, Lipton said. Achieving the fiscal objectives will require a multi-year revenue mobilisation strategy to broaden the tax base and raise tax revenue in a well-balanced and equitable manner, he said. It will also require a strong commitment by the provinces to support the consolidation effort and effective public financial management to improve the quality and efficiency of public spending, he said. Observing that protecting the most vulnerable from the impact of adjustment policies will be an important priority, Lipton said that this will be achieved by a significant increase in resources allocated to key social assistance programmes, supporting measures for the economic empowerment of women and investment in areas where poverty is high. A flexible market-determined exchange rate and an adequately tight monetary policy will be key to correcting imbalances, rebuilding reserves and keeping inflation low, he said, adding that an ambitious agenda to strengthen institutions and remove impediments to growth will allow Pakistan to reach its full economic potential. In an accompanying report, the IMF said that Pakistan's economy is at a critical juncture. The legacy of misaligned economic policies, including large fiscal deficits, loose monetary policy and defence of an overvalued exchange rate, fuelled consumption and short-term growth in recent years, but steadily eroded macroeconomic buffers, increased external and public debt, and depleted international reserves. Structural weaknesses remained largely unaddressed, including a chronically weak tax administration, a difficult business environment, inefficient and loss making state-owned enterprises, amid a large informal economy. ""Without urgent policy action, economic and financial stability could be at risk, and growth prospects will be insufficient to meet the needs of a rapidly growing population,"" the IMF said. The Fund-supported programme is expected to coalesce broader support from multilateral and bilateral creditors in excess of $38 billion, which is crucial for Pakistan to meet its large financing needs in the coming years, it added. Pakistan has so far received billions in financial aid packages from friendly countries like China, Saudi Arabia and the UAE during the current fiscal year.

Titled the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants (FHSI) Act, the bill is expected to come up for vote in the US House of Representatives this week – possibly as early as Tuesday night – with a similar version making its way through the Senate. Although the bill appears to have bipartisan support in both chambers, nativist lobbying groups have ramped up attacks against lawmakers supporting the bill, accusing them of being in cahoots with big technology companies and Wall Street, while selling American workers down the river claiming a shortage of high tech workers in the US, which they say does not present a true picture. Critics are specifically charging that India and Indian workers start to gain most from the bill while attacking lawmakers who have any perceived connection to India, such as Senator Kamala Harris of California, who supports the legislation in part because Silicon Valley comes under her political domain. Terming the purpose of the bill “white-collar labor trafficking,” Jessica Vaughn, policy director of the Center for Immigration studies, claimed that “If Harris’ outsourcing law is adopted, the rush of Central Americans migrants at the southern border will be overshadowed by a huge rush of Indian college graduates walking into professional jobs throughout the United States.” Breitbart, the right wing nativist website alleged that the legislation is “intended to help Indian graduates get roughly 120,000 green cards each year — or roughly five times as many green cards as they receive now,” while claiming “Harris’ bill is a special-interest fix for a problem collectively created by the federal government, India’s government, CEOs, investors, and their hired foreign contract-workers.” Current US law allows 140,000 green cards to foreign graduates who are nominated by their US employers, but because there is per country-cap of 7 per cent, no more than 9000 Indian professionals get green cards each year although tens of thousands of workers much coveted by U.S companies because of their skills are in waiting. The upcoming bills in the Senate and House increase the per-country cap on family-based immigrant visas from 7% of the total number of such visas available in a single year to 15%, and eliminate the 7% cap for employment-based visas. Some experts contend that if the per-country cap is lifted, then nearly all of the green cards in the ordinary professional worker category would go to Indian nationals simply because of the size of India’s population and the number of tech workers it produces. They say workers from other countries that receive employment green cards will be overrun by India. Conversely, critics of the current law say India is unfairly punished simply because of its size and the U.S loses out picking the best and the brightest. Currently law also favors smaller countries which are less represented in the U.S demographic mix. The Senate version of the bill introduced by Utah Republican Mike Lee has 31 co-sponsors, including 17 Republicans. The House version has 291 cosponsors, mostly Democrats. Both chambers will have to pass their respective bills (S.386 in Senate and H.R.1044 in House), and reconcile any differences in the two versions at a conference, before it can be sent to the President, upon whose signature it becomes law.

Iran on Monday breached a uranium enrichment cap set by a 2015 nuclear deal that the Trump administration abandoned last year. Washington has imposed punishing sanctions on Tehran, and tensions between the two sides have risen further amid Iran's downing of an American drone and attacks on tanker ships the US has blamed on the Islamic republic. Iran — which also passed a 300-kilogram limit on enriched uranium reserves this month — says it is not violating the deal, citing terms of the agreement allowing one side to temporarily abandon some commitments if it deems the other side is not respecting its part of the accord.

This year’s figure is in sharp contrast to the 12 cases reported last year and only 8 in 2017. Of the 41, the maximum number of afflicted children (33) are from the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province, including the newly merged tribal districts bordering Afghanistan. Punjab and Sindh have reported three cases each, and Balochistan two. Pakistan is one of the three countries in the world where polio is categorized as an endemic viral infection. Yet, parents – largely threatened by militants and influenced by clerics who suspect the vaccination drive to be a Western conspiracy to harm or sterilise Muslim children – refuse to inoculate their children. Four new cases of polio were reported on Monday. According to government authorities, two cases were found in KP’s Bannu district, while two were reported from the restive southwestern Balochistan province. In Bannu, the poliovirus was confirmed in a 12-month-old girl and in a 30-month-old boy. With the latest cases, the number of children detected with poliovirus in Bannu this year has risen to 16. In Balochistan, officials associated with the polio eradication programme said an eight-month-old child fell prey to the crippling disease in Chaman. Health officials in Chaman described refusal by parents to inoculate their children as the underlying reason behind the fresh case. Another case of polio was confirmed in a nine-month-old infant in Jaffarabad, prompting authorities in Balochistan to declare an emergency.

Former defence secretary Hemasiri Fernando and suspended police chief Pujith Jayasundera were suspended by President Sirisena for their alleged inaction on the intelligence shared by India, which warned of an impending attack by Islamic militants, and thereby, failing to prevent the Easter attacks. They were arrested last week after Attorney General Dappula de Livera instructed the authorities to charge them for their failure to prevent the blasts on April 21 that claimed 258 lives. Delivering a lengthy order, Colombo Chief Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne said that the judiciary was not obliged to keep people in jail to please the wishes of the police or anyone else. Jayaratne ruled that there was no sufficient facts against the suspects to constitute a murder charge. Fernando and Jayasundera were released on one surety bail of Rs 500,000 for each. The Chief Magistrate said the commission of inquiry appointed by President Sirisena was not a sufficient ground to arrest and detain the two officials. She regretted that not even a statement had been recorded from Jayasundera and Fernando before their detention. President Sirisena had appointed a three-member panel to probe the negligence by the top officials despite the availability of intelligence inputs on the impending attacks. Both Jayasundera and Fernando have testified before an ongoing parliamentary probe panel on the attacks. Both of them claimed that there was discounting of the seriousness of the threat at the very highest level. Sirisena is the minister-in-charge of defence. The eight coordinated suicide attacks were carried out by local Jihadi group National Thowheed Jammath (NTJ) linked to the ISIS. President Sirisena has slammed the parliamentary probe as one to pin blame on him and accused Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe of being the mover behind the panel. The opposition blames the government's inability to prevent the suicide bombings due to the ongoing power struggle between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe. Wickremesinghe has said that he had been excluded from attending the national security council by Sirisena since October last year.

The US State Department's decision to greenlight the first big-ticket US military sale to the self-ruled democratic island in decades comes amid already strained ties between Washington and Beijing. ""The sale of weapons by the United States to Taiwan... seriously violates the one-China principle... grossly interferes in China's internal affairs and undermines China's sovereignty and security interests,"" said foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang. Geng said that China has already lodged formal complaints through diplomatic channels expressing ""strong dissatisfaction and resolute opposition"" to the move. ""China urges the US to... immediately cancel the planned arms sale and stop military relations with Taipei to avoid damaging Sino-US relations and harming peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,"" Geng said. According to the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) the deal includes 108 M1A2T Abrams tanks, 250 Stinger portable anti-aircraft missiles and related equipment and support. Taiwan has been ruled separately from China since the end of a civil war in 1949, but Beijing considers it a part of its territory to be retaken -- by force if necessary. China has significantly stepped up diplomatic and military pressure on Taipei since the election in 2016 of President Tsai Ing-wen, whose Democratic Progressive Party refuses to acknowledge that the island is part of ""One China"". It has also staged military exercises near the island, and steadily reduced the already small number of nations that recognise Taiwan. The United States switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 1979, but has remained an important ally — and arms supplier — to Taipei. Laws passed that year by Congress required Washington to provide the island with means of self-defence. But it has been wary of big-ticket military equipment sales to Taiwan in recent years, fearful of stoking anger in Beijing.

The memos published in the Mail on Sunday contain highly critical comments from ambassador Kim Darroch about the current state of Trump's government, providing a rare look at how a senior British diplomat views the government of Britain's closest ally. ""We don't really believe this administration is going to become substantially more normal; less dysfunctional; less unpredictable; less faction riven; less diplomatically clumsy and inept,"" Darroch wrote in one of a series of leaked documents covering the period from 2017 to the present. Britain's Foreign Office did not challenge the authenticity of the leaked documents. It called the leak ""mischievous behaviour"" and said the public expects diplomats to provide honest assessments of the politics in the countries where they are posted. The memos also characterised Trump's policy on Iran as ""incoherent, chaotic."" Trump has frustrated European allies by withdrawing the United States from a complex deal designed to prevent Tehran from obtaining nuclear weapons and has seemed in recent weeks to be on the verge of armed conflict with Iran. Darroch said there are doubts about whether the White House ""will ever look competent"" and that the only way to communicate with the president is by being simple and blunt. He said that while Trump had been ""dazzled"" by British pageantry on a state visit hosted by Queen Elizabeth II in June, the successful visit would not lead to a fundamental shift in Trump's priorities. ""This is still the land of America First,"" he wrote.

US researchers from Harvard University trained a machine learning algorithm on hundreds of the Fab Four’s hits to build a “musical fingerprint” for each songwriter. It was then asked to assess eight iconic songs, or musical fragments, recorded between 1962 and 1966, where debate rages over who was the major influence. This includes tracks like “A Hard Day’s Night” and “In My Life” which are credited to the “Lennon-McCartney partnership”, but are widely believed to be entirely written by one or the other of the pair. The findings, published in Harvard Data Science Review, allow for each artist’s influences on the song to be assessed, and predicts the probability that either McCartney or Lennon were chiefly responsible. As recently as 2015, Sir Paul McCartney has vented his frustrations at what he sees as “revisionism” over his influence relative to Lennon’s after he was murdered in 1980. He went as far as reversing the song credits to read “McCartney-Lennon” in a 2002 album – to the annoyance of Lennon’s widow, artist Yoko Ono. Most of the eight songs of contested authorship were predicted to be predominantly in Lennon’s style, including tracks like “Ask Me Why” and the bridge to “A Hard Day’s Night” which McCartney sang and has suggested in previous interviews he had a role in. “In My Life”, which Rolling Stone magazine ranked, in 2011, the 23rd greatest song of all time has “garnered the greatest amount of speculation about its true author”, the researchers said. Lennon wrote the song’s lyrics, but McCartney has claimed he wrote all the music – something Lennon’s account disputed. The algorithm determined with 81.1 per cent certainty that Lennon wrote the verse, but McCartney’s influence in the song’s bridge was given with 43.5 per cent certainty. This would corroborate Lennon’s account that Paul contributed to the song’s middle-eight melody. “Breaking apart the song into the verse and the bridge separately, it is apparent that the verse is much more consistent stylistically with Lennon’s song writing,” the authors wrote. Other songs like “Baby’s in Black”, “The Word”, and “From Me to You” were more confidently McCartney’s with up to 97 per cent certainty. The system allows for a study of the way each musicians’ influences change over time, as well as the collaborative nature of song writing in popular music. Insights from the study include that McCartney’s work “tended to use more non-standard musical motifs” in his songs, with higher song complexity a “distinguishing feature” of his songs.

Media reports from Kathmandu said even several western diplomats had expressed reservations over the move by the K P Sharma Oli government. The permission for a public event to mark the Dalai Lama’s birthday was denied apparently because of security concerns. Nepal in the past has detained Tibetans on their way to India and later handed them over to Chinese authorities. Nepal is said to be home to about 20,000 Tibetans. Krishna Bahadur Katuwal, assistant district administrator of Kathmandu, was quoted by Reuters as saying the government refused permission for Tibetans to mark the Dalai Lama’s birthday because “infiltrators” could create trouble. “There could be a law and order problem as infiltrators could organise demonstrations or try to self-immolate.” According to the Reuters report, airport immigration authorities in Kathmandu refused to admit a US citizen of Tibetan origin and deported him last month, reportedly at China’s request. Many schools across Nepal were recently reported to have made it mandatory for students to learn Chinese. They were apparently lured by the Chinese government’s offer to cover salaries of teachers who teach Mandarin. India has also followed with anxiety the recent visit by the Nepal army chief to Beijing which saw the two sides agreeing to further “upgrade” military ties. The Dalai Lama’s birthday event in Kathmandu, according to media reports, was to be attended by several western diplomats. “These diplomats have expressed serious concerns about the forced cancellation of the event, which is a severe violation of rights of people of the Tibetan community,” one of them was quoted as having said by Himalayan Times on condition of anonymity.

Luigi Ventura, 74, faces four complaints of sexual abuse -- including that he molested a junior official at the Paris town hall. French prosecutors in March asked the Vatican to lift his immunity. A spokesman said the foreign ministry ""received confirmation from the Holy See that it had waived (Ventura's) immunity"" in a letter that arrived late last week. In February, French prosecutors revealed they were investigating the Italian-born archbishop over an incident at the town hall during a New Year's address by Mayor Anne Hidalgo. During the ceremony, a city employee had their backside repeatedly groped, with the town hall filing a complaint on January 24. An investigation was opened the next day. Two other people have since come forward and related incidents involving ""similar gestures, hands on buttocks or thighs"", which allegedly took place last year. There was also a complaint filed in Ottawa by a man who made similar allegations about an incident in 2008 while Ventura was serving in Canada. In Paris, prosecutors said they had requested on March 7 that the Vatican lift his immunity ""in the context of the inquiry involving him in the matter of sexual assault"". In response, the Holy See sent back a letter dated July 2 in which it confirmed waiving his immunity from prosecution. The move was welcomed by Mathieu de la Souchere, one of the complainants who travelled to Rome with his lawyer last week to meet a Vatican official from an advisory panel that reports to the pope on cases of sexual abuse. ""I'm very surprised because for six months, I had been told that getting his diplomatic immunity lifted was not feasible because it involved an abuser protected by his status,"" said Souchere, 27. ""Since the beginning, we have not had any support from the French government which refused to put its foot down. If we, as victims, had not spent our money to go to Rome, we wouldn't be where we are today."" In early April, the papal nuncio -- the term for a Vatican ambassador -- spoke to the police, with judicial sources saying it was ""at his request"". They gave no further details. A career diplomat with the Vatican, Ventura has held the position in Paris since 2009. He also served in Brazil, Bolivia and Britain before being appointed papal nuncio to Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso and Niger, Chile and then Canada. The case emerged as the Catholic Church struggles with a major crisis following the emergence of a wave of allegations detailing decades of sexual assault and abuse by clerics, mostly involving minors.

The flight ban impacted dozens of flights operated by six Russian airlines and one Georgian airline. President Vladimir Putin introduced it following a wave of anti-Russian protests in the Georgian capital sparked by a Russian lawmaker's appearance at the Georgian parliament. Russian lawmakers on Monday considered further restrictions after a Georgian TV host cursed Russian Putin in a live broadcast. The South Caucasus nation's scenic mountains, lush sea coast and renowned wine culture have drawn more than 1 million Russian tourists a year. Oksana Litvyak, who lives in the Russian town of Tosno outside St. Petersburg, grew up in Georgia and her parents and sister still are there. Litvyak bought airline tickets to go to Tbilisi in August the day before the Georgian parliament protests. ``I broke down and cried and got really angry but then started looking for new tickets,'' she said. ``This ban has hit ordinary people the worst because Russia and Georgia are tied together by centuries of history.'' Thousands of demonstrators converged on the Georgian parliament last month to protest what they saw as the Georgian government's pro-Russia stance. Police fired rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse protesters who tried to break into parliament, and the clashes left 240 people injured. The demonstrations reflected deep anti-Russian sentiments in Georgia, which made a botched attempt to regain control over the breakaway province of South Ossetia during the presidency of Mikheil Saakashvili, sparking the 2008 war with Russia. Moscow then recognized the independence of South Ossetia and another breakaway Georgian province of Abkhazia and set up military bases there. Last month's protests marked the largest outpouring of anger against the ruling Georgian Dream since it took power in 2012. The opposition accuses the Georgian Dream and its billionaire founder Bidzina Ivanishvil of being overly friendly to Russian interests. Tensions further escalated Monday after a host on Georgia's pro-opposition Rustavi 2 television station unleashed a stream of profanities about Putin and his parents in a live broadcast. Georgian officials quickly denounced the move, describing it as another attempt by the opposition to deepen the rift with Moscow. Russia's Foreign Ministry criticized the TV host's move as a manifestation of ""unbridled Russophobia,'' and some Russian lawmakers drafted new sanctions against Tbilisi. The lower house speaker, Vyacheslav Volodin, said lawmakers will ask the government to ban the imports of Georgian wine and mineral water and halt money transfers from Georgians living in Russia. Volodin said they cabled $641 million home last year. ""They must think twice before taking such actions against the Russian Federation,'' Volodin said in televised remarks. Georgian hotel owners and travel guides were estimating losses from a disrupted tourist season. Rusudan Japaridze, a tour guide in a Tbilisi travel agency, said the flight ban has already hurt bookings through October. Japaridze said 80% of Russian-language tour guides were left without work, citing his agency's figures. ""This is a total collapse of the segment that worked for the Russian market,'' Japaridze said.

The channel issued an apology, and Georgia's Prime Minister Mamuka Bakhtadze called the outburst a ""categorically unacceptable"" provocation that could threaten peace in the nation. The obscenities directed at Putin provoked a furious reaction from the Kremlin. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov called it ""absolutely unacceptable"" and a ""disgrace for Georgians"". The disturbance feeds into tensions that have seen lawmakers in the Russian parliament discussing curbed imports of Georgian wine and mineral water, and banning money transfers between the two countries. ""There is constant provoking of a conflict with Russia,"" said parliamentary speaker Vyacheslav Volodin. A ban on flights between the two countries decreed by Putin last month went into effect Monday. It was bound to affect the summer flow of tourists to Georgia's Black Sea resorts, traditionally popular among Russians seeking seaside sun.

""These least ones are tortured, abused and violated in detention camps, these least ones face the waves of an unforgiving sea,"" the pope told the mass, attended by 250 people including migrants, asylum seekers and rescue workers.

""When I say that the government intends to continue with its ongoing measures in the framework of the anti-IS coalition, then that means no ground troops,"" said German government spokesman Steffen Seibert. US special representative on Syria James Jeffrey told German media including the Die Welt newspaper Sunday that Washington wants Berlin to put boots on the ground in northern Syria. Jeffrey, who was visiting Berlin for Syria talks, added that he expects an answer this month. The mandate for Germany's participation in Syria runs out on October 31, meaning that parliament would be called on to decide what to do beyond that date. Seibert noted that Germany has ""for years been making a significant and internationally acknowledged contribution"" to fighting the Islamic State militants. Berlin is now in talks with the US on ""how the engagement should develop further"", he added. Washington has two goals in northeastern Syria: to support the US-backed Kurdish forces that expelled IS from northern Syria because they are increasingly threatened by Turkey, and to prevent a potential IS resurgence in the war-torn country. The US is hoping Europe will help, pressuring Britain, France and now Germany, which has so far deployed surveillance aircraft and other non-combat military support in Syria. However Germany's history makes military spending and foreign adventures controversial. Berlin sent soldiers to fight abroad for the first time since World War II in 1994, and much of the political spectrum and the public remains suspicious of such deployments.

Mitsotakis' New Democracy party won 39.8% of the vote, giving him 158 seats in the 300-member parliament, a comfortable governing majority. Tsipras' Coalition of the Radical Left, or Syriza, garnered 31.5%. The extremist right-wing Golden Dawn, Greece's third largest party during the height of the financial crisis, failed to make the 3% threshold to enter parliament. Mitsotakis will have to move fast to deal with the myriad of problems still plaguing the economy. Europe's finance ministers are meeting in Brussels on Monday and will be discussing Greece, which still has stringent fiscal targets to meet even though it no longer directly receives bailout loans. ""I assume the governance of the country with full awareness of the national responsibility,"" Mitsotakis said in his victory speech Sunday night. ""I know of the difficulties that lie ahead for me and for my associates. But I draw strength from the strength of the people."" Greece's economy shrank by a quarter and poverty and unemployment levels soared during the country's nearly decade-long financial crisis. Although its finances are on the mend and the economy is expected to grow by 2.2% this year, it still has a long way to go to make up the economic output lost. The country's debt stands at about 181% of annual GDP and Greece has pledged to continue producing large primary surpluses — the budget excluding debt servicing — of more than 3% of GDP for years to come. Mitsotakis said Sunday he would stick to his campaign pledges of lowering taxes, attracting investments and cutting through red tape to make Greece more business-friendly. ""New Democracy's clear victory in Greece's parliamentary elections yesterday will be welcomed by investors,"" said economics consultancy Capital Economics in a research note. ""But it will not be a game changer for the economy, not least because the government will still be constrained by its membership of the single currency and its `surveillance' agreement with the EU."" That caution was evident in the performance of the main stock market in Athens, which was down 1.4 percent in midday trading Monday as investors booked profits generated during the recent rally that was largely based on expectations of a Mitsotakis victory. Mitsotakis will also have to contend with pension increases and other benefits the outgoing government granted ahead of European elections in May — benefits which European creditors had warned could make Greece's fiscal targets hard to meet. ""Although Greece exited its third bailout in mid-2018, it is subject to `enhanced surveillance' which bears a striking resemblance to a bail-out program,"" Capital Economics said. ""For example, the government will get further relief on the cost of servicing its public debt only if it sticks to tight fiscal policy."" Mitsotakis is expected to name his cabinet later in the day. The ministers would then be sworn in on Tuesday.

In a statement, IAG said the UK information commissioner's office intends to issue the airline with a penalty notice under the UK Data Protection Act, totalling £183.39 million ($229.7 million, 205 million euros). The fine is equivalent to 1.5 per cent of British Airways' turnover in 2017, IAG added. IAG chief executive Willie Walsh said it would consider appealing the fine as it seeks ""to take all appropriate steps to defend the airline's position vigorously"". BA's CEO Alex Cruz said the airline was ""surprised and disappointed"" by the punishment. ""British Airways responded quickly to a criminal act to steal customers' data,"" he said in the statement. ""We have found no evidence of fraud/fraudulent activity on accounts linked to the theft. We apologise to our customers for any inconvenience this event caused,"" Cruz added. BA had revealed the hack in September, just a few months after the European Union tightened data protection laws with the so-called General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The stolen data comprised customer names, postal addresses, email addresses and credit card information. However the 15-day breach, which was fixed on discovery, did not involve travel or passport details. Following disclosure of the hack, BA promised to compensate affected customers and took out full-page adverts in the UK newspapers to apologise to passengers. It had meanwhile described the mass theft as ""a very sophisticated, malicious, criminal attack on our website"". IAG is the owner of five airlines, including also Aer Lingus, Iberia, Level and Vueling, none of which were affected by the hack. GDPR establishes the key principle that individuals must explicitly grant permission for their data to be used.

Three years after taking over the leadership of the conservative New Democracy party once headed by his father, the 51-year-old Harvard graduate and former McKinsey consultant has promised to ""steamroll"" obstacles to business. ""The people must entrust the helm of Greece to a strong hand,"" he told supporters on June 21. He has pledged to create ""better"" jobs through growth, foreign investment and tax cuts. His critics argue that his pro-business platform and promised tax cuts can only credibly come at the expense of social benefits to crisis-hit families. In his sole ministerial stint in charge of administrative reform in 2014, he was tasked with eliminating 15,000 civil service posts under pressure from Greece's creditors. The downsizing was cut short by elections, but Mitsotakis's tag as a hatchet man has endured. On the campaign trail, Mitsotakis told AFP his first priority would be to ""restart"" the economy. ""Greece (will) restore ambitious growth driven by private investments, exports and innovation. All our energy is focused in that direction."" He also wants to renegotiate Greece's tight fiscal targets in talks with the country's international creditors. ""If we present a comprehensive reforms package, (the creditors) will be open to a discussion that will gradually lower Greece's primary surpluses, which everybody acknowledges are too high,"" he says. ""And it will benefit both Europeans and the Greek economy,"" he adds. Outgoing PM Alexis Tsipras has warned that his successor would unleash ""Armageddon"" on workers. ""When (Mitsotakis) says reforms... it entails human blood... he has personally fired thousands,"" Tsipras told CNN Greece on June 22. ""The (2012-2015) government he was part of wiped out the middle class,"" he said. Fearful of alienating Greek civil servants and their families -- who account for a hefty percentage of the electorate -- Mitsotakis has been forced to publicly abjure further civil servant layoffs. ""No civil servants will be fired... but this does not mean we will be taking on more than we need... I will not tolerate pointless hirings,"" he told Star TV in June. Mitsotakis has long struggled to shake off his elitist image. In a country with a long tradition of nepotism, Mitsotakis swears by meritocracy and has vowed not to put any relatives in his cabinet. But few people in Greece have a pedigree as exclusive as his. He is the son of former prime minister Constantine Mitsotakis, one of the country's longest-serving parliamentarians. His sister is former minister Dora Bakoyannis, Athens' first female mayor. And new Athens mayor Costas Bakoyannis, elected in May, is his nephew. Since 2016, when he ran as a candidate for the leadership of New Democracy, Mitsotakis has consistently fought to distance himself from his status as a member of Greece's leading political dynasty and he considers himself a ""maverick"". ""Judge me by my CV, not by my name,"" he insists. Mitsotakis has sought to modernise the party, casting a wide net for candidates under the age of 40 and pledging to govern with people of ""my generation or younger."" But leftist critics say Mitsotakis has turned New Democracy into a ""hybrid"" of nationalism and extreme neoliberalism in an unholy alliance to keep internal party balances intact. Immediately after his election in 2016, the new leader raised eyebrows by naming Adonis Georgiadis, a recent transfer from the far-right LAOS party, as deputy chairman. A firebrand TV book salesman, Georgiadis publicly apologised in 2017 for energetically promoting an anti-Semitic tome on his shows as ""dynamite"" and ""my favourite book."" Another recently-arrived LAOS cadre who once headed a pro-Greek junta youth group, the lawyer Makis Voridis, was named shadow interior minister by Mitsotakis. Before joining LAOS, Voridis had headed the Hellenic Front, a short-lived party with close links to the far-right National Front party in France. Mitsotakis is given credit for restoring the fortunes of New Democracy, a demoralised party that had lost three successive elections to the charismatic Tsipras in the last five years. ""Citizens put their trust in us not only for our basic promises, to reduce taxes and to create good jobs and security for all, but for a different ethos and style of power,"" Mitsotakis said after winning European Parliament elections in May by a margin of nearly 9.5 points. A basketball lover, Mitsotakis has three children with Mareva Grabowski, a co-founder of luxury clothes label Zeus+Dione.

With more than 90% of votes counted, Mitsotakis' New Democracy party had 39.8% of the votes, compared to 31.5% for Tsipras' left-wing Syriza party. The extreme right-wing Golden Dawn party, founded by neo-Nazi supporters, narrowly failed to make the 3% threshold needed to enter parliament — a huge fall of support for a party that had become the third-largest in the Greek legislature during the country's financial crisis. The results indicated Greek voters bucked a recent trend in Europe of citizens rejecting the political mainstream and turning to populist and euroskeptic parties. ""I asked for a strong mandate to change Greece. You offered it generously,"" Mitsotakis said in his victory speech. ""From today, a difficult but beautiful fight begins."" Mitsotakis. 51, vowed to abide by his campaign pledges to cut taxes, attract investment and improve the job market. He had been ahead in opinion polls for three years and managed to build a sizeable lead. ""Greeks deserve better and the time has come for us to prove it,"" he said. Mitsotakis was scheduled to be officially sworn in as prime minister Monday, and was expected to announce his Cabinet later in the day. Tsipras conceded defeat and phoned Mitsotakis to congratulate him. ""The citizens have made their choice. We fully respect the popular vote,"" Tsipras said in a speech from central Athens. He said his party now would work to protect the rights of working Greeks as ""a responsible but dynamic opposition"" to the government. Tsipras said he hoped New Democracy's return to government ""will not lead to vengeance ... particularly toward the significant achievements to protect the social majority and the workers."" The election was the first since Greece emerged from three international bailouts that were dependent on successive governments implementing strict austerity measures, including major tax hikes and spending cuts. The financial crisis saw unemployment and poverty levels skyrocket and the economy shrink by a quarter. Mitsotakis, the son of a former prime minister, brother of a former foreign minister and uncle to a newly elected mayor of Athens, fought during the campaign to shed the image of family privilege. He pledged to make Greece more business-friendly, attract foreign investment, to modernize the country's notorious bureaucracy and to cut taxes. Tsipras, 44, called the election three months ahead of schedule after Syriza suffered a severe defeat in European Union and local elections in May and early June. He had led his small Coalition of the Radical Left, or Syriza, party to power in 2015 on promises to repeal the austerity of Greece's first two bailouts. But after months of tough negotiations with international creditors that saw Greece nearly crash out of the European Union's joint currency, he was forced to change tack and sign up to a third bailout that imposed spending cuts and tax hikes. He also cemented a deal with neighboring North Macedonia under which that country changed its name from plain ""Macedonia."" Although praised by Western allies, the deal angered many Greeks, who consider use of the term by their neighbor to harbor expansionist aims on the Greek province of the same name.

The move came more than a year after Washington pulled out of the landmark accord between world powers and Tehran, which says it has lost patience with perceived inaction by the remaining European partners. Iran surpassing the cap and reaching 4.5 percent enrichment was announced Monday by the country's atomic energy organisation spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi. ""This level of purity completely satisfies the power plant fuel requirements of the country,"" he said, quoted by the semi-official ISNA news agency. Kamalvandi hinted that the Islamic republic might stick to this level of enrichment for the time being, which is well below the more than 90-percent level required for a nuclear warhead. The UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), confirmed that Iran had enriched uranium to a level above the deal's cap. IAEA inspectors ""on 8 July verified that Iran is enriching uranium above 3.67 percent U-235,"" a statement said. Kamalvandi said that IAEA inspectors ""are supposed to take samples"" on Monday. The European Union said it was ""extremely concerned"" by the development and called on Iran to ""reverse all activities"" inconsistent with its deal commitments. France, Germany and Britain -- the European partners of the international deal -- on Sunday urged Tehran to halt its advance towards breaching the cap. Iran's foreign ministry warned against any escalatory response. If the Europeans ""do certain strange acts then we would skip all the next steps (in the plan to scale back commitments) and implement the last one,"" ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said. He did not specify what the final step would be but Iran's President Hassan Rouhani had warned previously that Iran could leave the nuclear accord. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif reiterated that Iran's actions could be reversed if European partners deliver on their part, insisting there was no better pact than the 2015 nuclear deal, of which he was a key architect. ""As it becomes increasingly clear that there won't be a better deal, they're bizarrely urging Iran's full compliance. There's a way out,"" he tweeted. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted Sunday that Iran would face ""further isolation and sanctions"". China and Russia, the other deal partners, both blamed the United States for the latest step by Iran. Beijing accused Washington of ""unilateral bullying"", while Moscow said passing the enrichment cap was one of the ""consequences"" of the White House abandoning the deal. Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Sunday singled out declining oil sales and the effect of financial sanctions as the main issues that needed to be solved, or Tehran would further step back from its nuclear commitments. ""We hope we can reach a solution, otherwise after 60 days we will take the third step as well,"" he said, adding that Tehran would give further details of that at an ""opportune moment"". Iran says that it is not violating the deal, citing terms of the agreement allowing one side to temporarily abandon some of commitments if it deems the other side is not respecting its part of the accord. According to Middle East analyst Sanam Vakil, Europe would need to engage Iran and the US simultaneously to prevent the situation escalating even further. ""A 'freeze for freeze' is the most immediate goal; keeping Iran within the JCPOA and then sanctions relief from the Trump administration,"" Vakil, a senior research fellow at the Chatham House think-tank in London, told AFP referring to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear deal. Rouhani in May flagged Tehran's intentions to start enriching uranium above the agreed maximum purification level of 3.67 percent. The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed this month that Iran has exceeded a 300-kilogramme limit on enriched uranium reserves, another cap that was imposed by the deal. The IAEA has scheduled a special meeting on Iran's nuclear programme for July 10.

The UAE, a leading member of the Western-backed Sunni Muslim coalition battling the Iran-aligned Houthi movement, is reducing its military presence as worsening US-Iran tensions threaten security closer to home, Reuters reported last month. The Gulf state has pulled some troops from areas including the southern port of Aden and the western coast, but says it remains committed to the internationally-recognised government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. The drawdown ""was not a last-minute decision"" and had been discussed extensively with Riyadh, said the official, who declined to be named. ""Our discussion over our redeployment has been ongoing for over a year and it has been heightened after the signing of the Stockholm agreement in December,"" the official told reporters in Dubai. The official said the port city of Hodeidah was most affected by the decision because of a holding ceasefire under a UN-led pact reached last year in Sweden to pave the way for talks to end the war. Hodeidah, a lifeline for millions of Yemenis, became the focus of the war last year when the coalition tried to seize the port, the Houthis’ main supply line. Under the deal, which has yet to be fully implemented, both the Houthis and pro-coalition Yemeni forces would withdraw. ""It makes a lot of sense for us to redeploy away from Hodeidah. By connection, Assab in Eritrea has also been affected because it was a staging ground for our operations in Hodeidah,” the official said, adding that troop movements in other areas of Yemen are ""tactical and based on our needs"". Abu Dhabi has a major military base at the Eritrean Red Sea port of Assab. ""We are not worried about a vacuum in Yemen, because we have trained a total of a 90,000 Yemeni forces,"" the official said. ""This is one of our major successes in Yemen."" IRAN TENSIONS Asked about the drawdown, the spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition said member countries played different roles and contributed whatever capabilities they could. ""The United Arab Emirates... and the coalition countries continue to achieve their operational and strategic goals and reach the final status of restoring the legitimate Yemeni government,"" Colonel Turki al-Malki told reporters in Riyadh. Diplomats have said the UAE prefers to have forces and equipment on hand should tensions between the United States and Iran escalate further after attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf and Tehran’s downing of a U.S. unmanned drone. The UAE has been urging de-escalation of regional tensions. ""Many people asked if this is also linked to the current rise of tensions with Iran. I would say fundamentally no... But of course we cannot be blind to the overall strategic picture,"" the official said. ""It is very much to do with moving to from what I would call a military-first strategy to a peace-first strategy."" Washington is in talks with allies about gathering a global coalition to protect vital oil shipping lanes in and near the Strait of Hormuz.

Tehran vowed to keep reducing its commitments every 60 days unless parties to the deal moved to protect it from U.S. sanctions. Such moves by Iran could ultimately lead to the return of all international sanctions on the country if a party or parties to the deal trigger its dispute resolution process. That process will not be triggered for now, said a source at French President Emmanuel Macron’s Elysee office on Sunday. The French government is giving itself until July 15 to try to get all parties talking again. Most U.N. sanctions were removed in January 2016 when the deal was implemented. It is formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and was agreed by the United States, Iran, Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia. U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States in May 2018 saying the accord did not go far enough and did not address Iran’s missile program or activities in the Middle East. Iran argues that, under the nuclear deal’s dispute resolution process, the U.S. withdrawal and renewed sanctions campaign constitute “significant non-performance” and Tehran can “treat the unresolved issue as grounds to cease performing its commitments in whole or in part.” However, two Western officials with knowledge of the accord, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Iran has never formally triggered the dispute resolution process. Iran also argues that it can reduce in its commitment because, under a separate provision, the agreement said: “Iran has stated that it will treat such a re-introduction or re-imposition of the sanctions ... or such an imposition of new nuclear-related sanctions, as grounds to cease performing its commitments under this JCPOA in whole or in part.” Here is how the dispute resolution process, which could take up to 65 days to play out unless extended by consensus, works: JOINT COMMISSION DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS STEP ONE - If any party to the nuclear deal believes another party is not upholding their commitments they can refer the issue to a Joint Commission, whose members are Iran, Russia, China, Germany, France, Britain and the European Union. (The United States was a member before it withdrew from the deal.) The Joint Commission then would have 15 days to resolve the issue, unless it agrees by consensus to extend the time period. STEP TWO - If any party believes the matter has not been resolved after that first step, they can refer it to the foreign ministers of the parties to the deal. The ministers would have 15 days to resolve the issue, unless they agree by consensus to extend the time period. In parallel with - or in lieu of - consideration by foreign ministers, the complaining party or the party accused of non-compliance could ask that the issue be looked at by a three-member advisory board. The participants in the dispute would each appoint a member and the third member would be independent. The advisory board must provide a non-binding opinion within 15 days. STEP THREE - If the issue is not resolved during the initial 30-day process, the Joint Commission has five days to consider any advisory board opinion in a bid to settle the dispute. STEP FOUR - If the complaining party is not satisfied after this and considers the matter to “constitute significant non-performance”, they could “treat the unresolved issue as grounds to cease performing its commitments under this JCPOA in whole or in part”. They also could notify the 15-member U.N. Security Council that the issue constitutes “significant non-performance”. In the notification the party must describe the good-faith efforts made to exhaust the Joint Commission dispute resolution process. UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL STEP FIVE - Once the complaining party notifies the Security Council, the body must vote within 30 days on a resolution to continue Iran’s sanctions relief. A resolution needs nine votes in favour and no vetoes by the United States, Russia, China, Britain or France to pass. STEP SIX - If such a resolution has not been adopted within 30 days, the sanctions in all previous U.N. resolutions would be re-imposed - referred to as snapback - unless the council decided otherwise. If the previous sanctions are re-imposed they would not apply retroactively to contracts Iran signed.

Authorities in Gibraltar said they suspected the tanker was carrying crude to Syria in violation of EU sanctions. Tehran denies this and claims the vessel was intercepted in international waters. Gibraltar's Supreme Court ruled Friday that the tanker can be held for 14 more days, the territory's attorney general said.

Ho, a pro-democracy canto-pop star, has joined the huge marches of protesters calling for democratic reforms and a halt to sliding freedoms in semi-autonomous Hong Kong. Before addressing the council, Ho told AFP the international community, including the United States, should raise its voice louder in defence of rights in the territory. ""They have the power to (put) pressure on China,"" she said. At Human Rights Council, Ho condemned legislation that triggered the worst crisis in Hong Kong's recent history- a now-suspended law that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. ""Will the United Nations convene an urgent session to protect the people of Hong Kong?"" she asked council members, insisting that freedoms in the territory were ""under serious attack."" The rights council can hold extraordinary sessions on global crises, which generally produce resolutions that seek to raise awareness but have no influence on the ground. Ho's speech was twice interrupted by the first secretary at the Chinese mission, Dai Demao raising points of order- a procedure member states use when they feel a speaker has breached UN rules. Dai said Ho perpetrated an ""affront"" against Beijing by equating Hong Kong and China, rather than referring to Hong Kong as part of China. After Ho finished her speech, she told reporters she was not trying to put China and Hong Kong ""on the same level."" But, she added, ""we are all in danger in Hong Kong because we're on the edge of becoming another (Chinese) city where we would lose our freedom of speech."" ""This is really the tipping point where either we can safeguard our city or it goes the other way,"" she added. Protesters want the extradition bill to be scrapped, an independent inquiry into police tactics used against protesters, amnesty for those arrested, and for the city's unelected pro-Beijing leader Carrie Lam to step down.

Al Qaeda-linked Shabaab fighters have been fighting for more than a decade to topple the government. They have lost many strongholds since 2011, but still control of large parts of rural Somalia from where they launch guerrilla attacks. ""Two Al-Shabaab gunmen attacked the security checkpoint and exchanged fire with the security forces,"" said Mohamed Adan, a security official in Mogadishu.

The Global Study on Homicide 2019 published Monday by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said that about 464,000 people across the world were killed in homicides in 2017, an increase from 395,542 in 1992. The number of people killed in homicides in 2017 far surpassed the 89,000 killed in armed conflicts in the same period. However, because the global population has risen faster than the increase in recorded homicide victims, the overall risk of being killed in homicides has declined steadily. The global homicide rate, measured as the victims of homicide per 100,000 people, declined from 7.2 in 1992, to 6.1 in 2017, the report said. The lowest regional rate of homicide in 2017 was reported in Asia, with 104,000 victims representing a rate of 2.3 per 100,000 population. Asia, which contains 60 per cent of the global population, accounted for 23 per cent of total homicide victims worldwide. The 2017 global homicide rate masks dramatic regional variations. Countries in the Americas reported 173,000 victims of intentional homicide – 37 per cent of the global total in a region that accounts for only 13 per cent of the world's population. The homicide rate of 17.2 victims per 100,000 population in the Americas was the highest recorded in the region since reliable records began in 1990. Africa was the only other region with a homicide rate exceeding the global average, with 13.0 victims per 100,000 population, or 163,000 victims in total. The report said that though homicide rates remain high in the Americas, the picture varies hugely within the region and within individual countries. In Central America, the country with the highest homicide rate (62.1) had a rate more than seven times that of the country with the lowest. In South America, the country with the highest homicide rate (56.8) had a rate more than 16 times that of the country with the lowest. ""The Global Study on Homicide seeks to shed light on gender-related killings, lethal gang violence and other challenges, to support prevention and interventions to bring down homicide rates,"" said UNODC Executive Director Yury Fedotov. ""Countries have committed to targets under the Sustainable Development Goals to reduce all forms of violence and related death rates by 2030. This report offers important examples of effective community-based interventions that have helped to bring about improvements in areas afflicted by violence, gangs and organized crime."" Most homicide victims are men, but women more often killed by family and intimate partners. Some 87,000 women and girls were intentionally killed in 2017, a decrease from 2012. The share of women killed by intimate partners or other family members, however, rose from 47 per cent of all female homicide victims in 2012 to 58 per cent in 2017, and the overall number who lost their lives to this type of homicide rose from 48,000 victims in 2012 to 50,000 in 2017. ""The home remains the most dangerous place for women, who continue to bear the heaviest burden of lethal victimization as a result of inequality and gender stereotypes,"" the report said. It said that Asia accounted for the largest number of all women killed worldwide by intimate partners or other family members in 2017, with an estimated 20,000 victims. However, an estimated 19,000 women in Africa also lost their lives in this way. Africa has a much smaller population, meaning that women in Africa run a greater risk of being killed by an intimate partner or other family member than women in Asia, it said. Globally, about 81 per cent of homicide victims recorded in 2017 were men and boys, and more than 90 per cent of suspects in homicide cases were men. However, the study shows that the gender disparity among victims changes with age. Girls and boys aged nine and under are killed at roughly equal rates, in marked contrast to all other age groups, in which males make up more than 50 per cent of the victims, according to data from 41 countries. Organised crime alone was responsible for up to 19 per cent of all homicides in 2017. Since the start of the 21st century, organized crime killed about as many people as all armed conflicts across the world combined. Elsewhere in the world, firearm killings are less common than in the Americas – measured both on a per capita basis and as a proportion of all homicides. Still, in Asia firearm-related deaths constitute the largest share of homicide cases, although on a smaller scale overall, it said. The report stressed that targeted and efficient interventions to counter homicide require a comprehensive understanding of its scale and drivers. The drivers of homicide highlighted in the study include inequality, unemployment, political instability, the prevalence of gender stereotypes in society, and the presence of organized crime. The study also points to the importance of a governance model centred on the rule of law, control of corruption, and investment in socioeconomic development, including in education, as critical in bringing down the rate of violent crime. Firearms and drugs and alcohol are further facilitators of homicide that need to be addressed, according to the study Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."|"Asia records lowest homicide rate in the world: UN report"|"Mon Jul 08 18:57:00 CEST 2019"|"[world]"

Protest organisers said 230,000 people marched through the streets of Kowloon, across the harbour from Hong Kong’s Central business district, in the latest wave of demonstrations against an extradition bill that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face trial. Police put the number at 56,000 at its peak. Chinese censors have worked hard to erase or block news of Hong Kong’s biggest and most violent protests in decades amid fears they could inspire demonstrations on the mainland. Hong Kong’s embattled leader Carrie Lam suspended the extradition bill after violent protests last month when police fired rubber bullets and tear gas, but she has rejected calls to scrap it. Protests over the bill have now morphed into calls for Lam to step down, investigations over what some describe as excessive police force and greater democracy. Hong Kong has been governed under a “one country, two systems” formula since its return from British to Chinese rule in 1997, allowing freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China, including the right to protest and an independent judiciary. Critics say the extradition law could threaten Hong Kong’s rule of law and its international reputation as an Asian financial hub. Some Hong Kong tycoons have already started moving personal wealth offshore. Clashes broke out on Sunday as police moved to disperse some activists after they blocked roads following the largely peaceful protest over the bill that has plunged the former British colony into political turmoil. On July 1, the anniversary of Hong Kong’s return to Chinese rule, protesters besieged and ransacked the legislative building in the heart of the city before being driven back by police firing tear gas.

Noorul Hassan, 55, a resident of Sadiqabad, some 400kms from Lahore, underwent the weight reduction surgery on June 28 after he was air lifted on a Pakistan Army helicopter to Lahore for treatment on the special directives from Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa, the Dawn news reported. After the surgery, he was shifted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) to be kept under observation. On Monday, Hassan and a second patient died after they were left unattended following chaos by the attendants of a female patient who passed away at the Shalamar Hospital earlier during the day, the report said. ""In the chaos that ensued, Noor and a second patient died due to the unavailability of staff,"" Dr Maazul Hassan was quoted as saying in the report. He added that the relatives of the female patient did not intend to cause the deaths but the situation worsened due to the violence. Maazul said that while the chaos was taking place, Noorul was feeling unwell and was left unattended for nearly an hour. ""When they (hospital staff) noted this, they attempted to resuscitate him but were unable to successfully to do so,"" he added. Hospital staff said that relatives of the female patient had broken windows, switched ventilators off and attacked the doctors. They added that nurses left the ICU during the commotion. A spokesperson for the hospital said that they were investigating the incident and needed to look at the CCTV footage. ""Everyone was trying to save themselves during the chaos in the hospital,"" the spokesperson said. Prior to Hassan's weight reduction surgery, Pakistan Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa made special arrangements for his transfer and treatment. Personnel from the Rescue 1122 had to break the wall of his house to take him outside as he was too big to pass through the main gate of his house. According to media reports, Hassan was the heaviest man in Pakistan, but there is no official confirmation about this. Earlier in 2017, Pakistan's most obese person with a weight of 360 kg underwent laparoscopic surgery and succeeded to bring his weight below 200 kg. According to a survey report released by the Pakistan Endocrine Society last year, 29 per cent of the Pakistani population is overweight, out of which 51 per cent are categorised in the obesity class.

Prime Minister Khan, after assuming office last year, launched several austerity measures. Officials in Islamabad are believed to have informed the Pakistan embassy that Prime Minister Khan desires to stay at the ambassador's official residence in Washington during his three-day visit to the US starting from July 21, Dawn newspaper reported. The International Monetary Fund's executive board last week approved a three-year USD 6 billion bailout plan to resuscitate Pakistan's ailing economy. But the IMF has attached some tough terms for the bailout, indicating that the government needs to take strict austerity measures. While staying at the ambassador's residence can considerably reduce the cost of the visit, Dawn report said that neither the United States secret service nor the city administration appears “very receptive” to the idea, the paper said. The US secret service takes over the security of a visiting dignitary as soon as he or she lands in the US while the city administration has to ensure that the visit does not disrupt Washington's traffic. The ambassador's residence is in the heart of Washington's diplomatic enclave. There are at least a dozen embassies in and around that area, including those of India, Turkey and Japan. A visiting government head holds a number of meetings with US officials, lawmakers and media and think-tank representatives during his stay in Washington. Since the residence is not large enough for all these meetings, the prime minister will have to meet his guests at the Pakistan embassy, commuting through Washington's busy traffic during rush hours. To do so, his entourage will have to drive by most of these embassies as well as the US vice president's official residence, the report said. Some immediate family members of President Trump also live between the two locations. Any closure of the street on which the ambassador's residence is situated will prevent other residents, including several ambassadors, from travelling to and from their workplaces during the three-day stay of Khan. Security issues force visiting heads of state and government to stay at one of half a dozen hotels that have special arrangement for VVIPs. This makes it easy for the US secret service to protect the guest. But if the prime minister still wants to avoid a hotel, he can stay with one of the rich Pakistani-Americans in the DC suburbs, the report said. Most of these houses have high boundary walls and can be easily secured. Staying in a suburb, however, means travelling to Washington every morning and holding all the meetings at the Pakistan Embassy, it said. This, however, will be another headache for the US secret service, the report said.

Iran on Sunday announced to boost the enrichment of the uranium beyond the limits set by the landmark 2015 nuclear deal as a protest against President Donald Trump's decision in May to pull the US out of the deal. While expressing regret and criticising the US for creating the crisis, China, however, skirted a direct response to the question whether it would continue to import Iranian oil in violation of the US sanctions. ""China regrets the Iranian announcement to further scale back its commitment to the nuclear deal,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters here. Ensuring the effective implementation of the deal is requirement of the UN Security Council resolution as well as the only viable way out of the nuclear issue and to ease the tensions, he said. ""We call on all parties to bear in mind to keep the big picture and long term interests and exercise restraint and support the settlement of the Iranian nuclear issue"" by creating conditions to jointly upholding the deal, Geng said. ""The US maximum pressure is the root cause for the current crisis. The US not only pulled out of the nuclear deal but also exercised the unilateral sanctions and long arm jurisdiction over Iran creating increasing obstacles for the implementation of the deal. ""This in effect has proven that unilateral bullying act has created greater crisis worldwide. The international community should stay committed to multilateralism and seek political and diplomatic settlement under the international law,"" the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said. Asked whether China, which is a major importer of Iranian oil, will stop buying it in response to the US threat to impose sanctions, Geng said: ""I shall stress the international community including China have normal cooperation with Iran.

The International Atomic Energy Agency has confirmed that Iran had exceeded the limit that the deal imposed on its stockpile of low-enriched uranium. Under the 2015 nuclear deal, Iran had agreed to cap its stockpile of low-enriched uranium at 300 kilograms, one of the several restrictions on its nuclear activities, in exchange for the lifting of almost all international sanctions.

Among over 20 Democratic presidential aspirants, Harris, 54, whose mother had migrated to the US from Chennai, is running neck to neck with former US vice president Joe Biden, particularly after her impressive show at the first primary debate held recently. Harris's presidential campaign raised nearly $12 million from more than 279,000 people in the second quarter of 2019. She has raised more than $23 million in this campaign. Almost 150,000 new donors contributed to Harris's campaign during the second quarter. According to a campaign statement, Harris brought in more than $7 million through her digital program alone. The campaign's average contribution was $39, and the average online contribution was just $24. Harris launched her campaign on January 21 with a promise to reject money from corporate PACs and federal lobbyists. So far, Harris' campaign has brought in nearly half a million dollars this quarter from its online store, which has already sold 1,400 “That Little Girl Was Me” t-shirts that feature a now-viral photo of Harris as a young girl. This was the single best-selling item in the month of June, despite not being available until June 28. “The momentum Kamala Harris is seeing right now is buoyed by hundreds of thousands of grassroots supporters who believe in her 3 am Agenda to address the issues keeping people up at night,” said Harris campaign manager Juan Rodriguez. “As it has been from the beginning, this campaign is powered by the people. These resources will help expand Kamala's growing strength in this primary and put her position to win the Democratic nomination,” Rodriguez said. Following her commanding performance in the first debate, Harris will return to campaign in New Hampshire Sunday, July 14. At a house party in Gilford and a town hall in Somersworth, Harris will discuss her plans to deliver tangible solutions to the real challenges facing American families. A day earlier, she announced her $100 billion plan to invest in minority home ownership to address the racial wealth gap. The plan would affect four million home buyers who either live on rent or in historically redlined communities' area, amend the credit reporting process and hold lenders accountable for discriminatory practices. “I will remove unfair barriers Black Americans face when they go to qualify for a home loan. I will strengthen anti-discrimination lending laws and implement stricter enforcement. And I'll invest — I'll invest through the federal government — $100 billion to put home ownership within the reach for those who live in redlined communities and it would help up to four million families with down payments and closing costs,” Harris said.

The memos published in the Mail on Sunday contain highly critical comments from ambassador Kim Darroch about the current state of Trump's government, providing a rare look at how a senior British diplomat views the government of Britain's closest ally. ""We don't really believe this administration is going to become substantially more normal; less dysfunctional; less unpredictable; less faction riven; less diplomatically clumsy and inept,"" Darroch wrote in one of a series of leaked documents covering the period from 2017 to the present. Britain's Foreign Office did not challenge the authenticity of the leaked documents. It called the leak ""mischievous behaviour"" and said the public expects diplomats to provide honest assessments of the politics in the countries where they are posted. The memos also characterised Trump's policy on Iran as ""incoherent, chaotic."" Trump has frustrated European allies by withdrawing the United States from a complex deal designed to prevent Tehran from obtaining nuclear weapons and has seemed in recent weeks to be on the verge of armed conflict with Iran. Darroch said there are doubts about whether the White House ""will ever look competent"" and that the only way to communicate with the president is by being simple and blunt. He said that while Trump had been ""dazzled"" by British pageantry on a state visit hosted by Queen Elizabeth II in June, the successful visit would not lead to a fundamental shift in Trump's priorities. ""This is still the land of America First,"" he wrote.

It was the first time Liao Qiang had worshipped publicly since authorities shut down his church in China seven months ago. The 49-year-old arrived in Taiwan last week after fleeing China with five family members. He and his 23-year-old daughter, Ren Ruiting, described living under constant surveillance for the past seven months after authorities detained them and dozens of other members of their prominent but not government-sanctioned church in December. China's ruling Communist Party has carried out a widespread crackdown on all religious institutions in recent years, including bulldozing churches and mosques, barring Tibetan children from Buddhist religious studies and incarcerating more than a million members of Islamic ethnic minorities in what are termed ""re-education centers."" President and party leader Xi Jinping has ordered that all religions must ""Sinicize"" to ensure they are loyal to the officially atheistic party. In contrast, Taiwan's democratically elected government has long taken a hands-off approach to religion on the island, where most follow Buddhism and traditional Chinese beliefs, but where Christianity and other religions also thrive. Liao and Ren's account is the first detailing what has happened since the detentions began at the Early Rain Covenant Church. It shows the determination of the Chinese government — and the lengths it has gone — to eradicate a congregation that has long been a thorn in its side. Early Rain's pastor, Wang Yi, who remains detained, has been critical of Xi and the party. He has made a point of holding a prayer service on June 4 each year to commemorate the 1989 bloody crackdown on democracy protesters in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, an anniversary that China's government has sought to wipe from memory. Ren told The Associated Press that she had to report her whereabouts to police using social media whenever she went out. She was told her safety couldn't be guaranteed if she disobeyed. ""That's when I knew it was no longer safe for us here, and that my children were most in danger,"" Liao said after Sunday's service, attended by about 30 people, at the small Reformed Presbyterian Xinan Church in Taipei. Government officials in China did not immediately respond to requests for comment. China's government requires that Protestants worship only in churches recognized and regulated by the officially sanctioned Three-Self Patriotic Movement, although many more are part of independent congregations. More than 100 members of Early Rain were taken into custody from the church or their homes on Dec. 9 and 10, according to Human Rights Watch. Those detained included Wang, the pastor. His wife, Jiang Rong, was released on bail last month. Liao said the police tried to force him to sign a statement renouncing his church, but he refused. ""If our elders decided to break up the church, then I can accept it,"" he said. ""But it's not up to you to say it's evil or illegal."" Liao and his family hope to stay in Taiwan while they seek asylum in the United States, but with a 15-day tourist visa, their future is unclear. ""I'm not sure whether they can stay beyond the visa, unless the Taiwanese government is willing to make it a humanitarian case on the basis of religious persecution,"" said Chiu Ling-yao, secretary-general of the Taiwan Association for China Human Rights, which is trying to help the family find a solution. The spokeswoman for the American Institute in Taiwan — the de facto US embassy — could not be reached for comment. Ren hopes that one day she can return to her home. ""One day when China opens up, we'll go back,"" she said. ""Whether it's five years, or even 10 years, we'll eventually make our way back to where God wants us to serve.""

The leaders discussed ways to ""strengthen economic and financial cooperation"" and also reviewed security matters in the wake of ""Iranian threats"" to regional waterways, the Saudi Press Agency said. Hammond's visit comes after Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman reiterated last month that state-owned Aramco's much-delayed initial public offering - dubbed as potentially the world's biggest stock sale - would take place in late 2020 or early 2021. Saudi Arabia has not announced where the listing will be held, but London, New York and Hong Kong have all vied for a slice of the much-touted IPO. Hammond was accompanied by London Stock Exchange chief David Schwimmer and investment minister Graham Stuart on his two-day visit to Jeddah that began on Saturday, according to a British government statement. Saudi Arabia plans to sell up to five percent of the world's largest energy firm and hopes to raise up to $100 billion. The planned IPO forms the cornerstone of a reform programme envisaged by Prince Mohammed to wean the Saudi economy off its reliance on oil. Hammond's visit comes after an apparent setback in relations last month when Britain temporarily suspended approving new Saudi arms export licenses that might contribute towards the kingdom's five-year bombing campaign in neighbouring Yemen. The decision came after a British court ordered the government to ""reconsider"" the sales due to their toll on the civilian population in Yemen.

The Taliban, believing they have the upper hand in the war, have kept up attacks even while talking to the United States and agreeing to the Afghan dialogue. A Taliban car bomb in eastern Afghanistan killed at least 12 people and wounded scores more on Sunday, officials said.

The sculpture was carved into a tree using a chainsaw and depicts Melania in a blue dress raising her left hand in a waving gesture, emulating a pose she struck at her husband's 2017 inauguration.

""I can understand why people might think that this falls short as a description of her physical appearance,"" Downey said, but insisted that he found the end result ""absolutely beautiful"". Since Trump took office in 2017, sleepy Sevnica has become a magnet for tourists and journalists searching for insights into the American first lady's past.

After nearly five years in power, Greece's longest-serving crisis premier — as well as the youngest in more than a century — is battling to overcome a 10-point deficit in opinion polls amid widespread dissatisfaction after years of high taxation. Polling stations opened at 7am local time and will close at 07.00 pm with 9,903,864 Greeks having the right to vote, according to the Athens News Agency. Exit polls are expected soon after polls close and the first results should come in around 09.00 pm. With three new opinion polls predicting a clear victory for the conservative New Democracy party, Tsipras called for supporters to mobilise, hoping for a turn around. ""Today we are fighting this battle from the first to the last minute. With optimism and determination. The ballots are empty and all possibilities are open,"" he tweeted on Sunday. After voting in Kypseli, near the centre of Athens, with his supporters cheering, the premier called on young people ""not to leave this crucial decision for their lives in the hands of others"". Opinion polls have consistently forecast that New Democracy headed by Kyriakos Mitsotakis, a former banker and scion of a leading Greek political family, will win an absolute majority in Sunday's legislative elections. ""Today is a big celebration of democracy. Greek women and men hold the fate of this land in their hands,"" Mitsotakis said after voting in an Athens suburb. Some members of a small far-left party protested outside the polling station were Mitsotakis voted, but their shouts were drowned out by New Democracy supporters calling their leader the new prime minister. ""I hope that from tomorrow we will be able to breathe with relief. To take a deep breath. If Mitsotakis does what he promises,"" Athinodoros, a 48-year-old self-employed worker voting in Athens told AFP. Tsipras has accused Mitsotakis — who was part of a 2012-2014 crisis government — of ""disastrous"" mismanagement that brought hundreds of thousands of job losses and business failures. According to the latest polls, New Democracy is expected to gain between 151 to 165 seats in the 300-seat parliament. Syriza meanwhile is forecast to fall from 144 seats to between 70 and 82. Tsipras called the snap election in June after losing both European and local elections to Mitsotakis' New Democracy in the space of two weeks. The man tipped be Greece's next prime minister is a 51-year-old Harvard graduate and former McKinsey consultant with controversial civil service job cuts on his resume. Mitsotakis, who took over New Democracy three years ago, has pledged to create ""better"" jobs through growth, foreign investment and tax cuts and to ""steamroll"" obstacles to business. Tsipras, on the other hand, touts his party's track record in reducing unemployment and raising the minimum wage for the first time since 2012. His government also rolled out a batch of last-minute tax cuts in May. But Tsipras has been widely criticised for campaigning as an anti-austerity crusader before eventually accepting a third EU bailout. Christos Maravlis, who cast his ballot for the once-radical leftists in 2015, says many voters will be seeking to ""punish Syriza for betraying the Greek people"" with false promises. The vote is be Greece's third poll in as many months, and the country's first mid-summer general election since 1928 is unlikely to set participation records. In May, fewer than 59 percent of registered voters cast ballots for European Parliament polls and the first round of local and regional elections. Participation fell below 42 percent for the second round a week later. With temperatures forecast to reach 39 degrees Celsius (102 degrees Fahrenheit), all parties are concerned about the impact the heat will have on turnout. The front page of the Proto Thema newspaper on Saturday showed a cartoon of a man catching some summer sun on an inflatable mattress. ""Enjoy your vacations and let others decide if you will be able to go on vacation again,"" the front page joked. Syriza's number of seats in the next parliament is expected to depend on how many of the smaller parties secure at least three percent of the vote, the minimum required to enter parliament. Two new arrivals are the MeRA25 anti-austerity party of Tsipras's former maverick finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, and Greek Solution, a nationalist, pro-Russia party formed by former journalist and TV salesman Kyriakos Velopoulos. Polls show that each new party could win between 9 and 10 MPs. Greek Solution has been buoyed by backlash against Tsipras' controversial agreement with North Macedonia that ended a bitter 27-year dispute over the country's name. The fledgling party has also picked up voters from neo-Nazi party Golden Dawn, which is in steep decline amid an ongoing trial for the 2013 murder of an anti-fascist rapper, allegedly carried out with the knowledge of senior Golden Dawn members.

The marchers converged on the Spanish capital's main Atocha train station for the start of the festivities. The 400,000 figure was later given by police. The slogan for this year's march was ""History, struggle and memory"" and participants marked 50 years since the Stonewall riots in New York in 1969 which were the foundation of the gay rights movement worldwide. Catholic Spain at the time was controlled by dictator General Francisco Franco and homosexual acts were illegal. Thousands of gay people were shipped off to rehabilitation centres or even jailed. Homosexuality was decriminalised in 1978, three year's after Franco's death, since when Spain has become one of the most LGBT-tolerant countries in the world, authorising gay marriage and adoptions by gay couples in 2005. ""I'm 53 years old and I have suffered,"" said Manuel Carmona, carrying a large rainbow flag for Saturday's march. ""But those who are 63-years-old suffered more and those who are 73-years-old even more and I want us to recognise these people who have helped us,"" added Carmona, who has been attending the pride march for 30 years. Madrid's city hall swung to the right in June after a conservative candidate was elected mayor with the support of newly-emerged far-right party Vox, in a move that has caused concern in Spain. Vox has said that the Madrid Gay Pride Parade should be moved to a park in the suburbs and opposes public subsidies for the event. ""They do not want to understand that when we talk about LGBT rights, we are talking about human rights,"" said Spanish interior minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska, who is himself gay and took part in the march. Activists say organised opposition against LGBT rights is growing across the continent, with populist politicians in Poland, Hungary and other European countries presenting gay rights as a threat to family values. Resurgent homophobia made the headlines in Britain recently after a lesbian couple became the high-profile victims of a homophobic attack after refusing to kiss for a gang of youths on a London night bus. The couple joined the annual Pride march through the heart of the British capital Saturday, which organisers said drew hundreds of thousands. In the Hungarian capital Budapest, marchers carried rainbow banners and flew ballons at a rally that passed from parliament through the city centre. Meanwhile, bishops in conservative, Catholic-majority Poland on Saturday denounced Swedish furniture giant Ikea for what they called ""LGBT indoctrination"" after an employee was sacked for refusing to take down a homophobic comment he had posted on the firm's internal website. The bishops congratulated the man — who had quoted passages from the Old Testament in the post — on his ""courage"" in defending his faith in everyday life in an ""exemplary"" way.

The Romanian-born Kor, who founded the Candles Museum in Terre Haute, Indiana and devoted her life to Holocaust awareness, was 85. ""We are deeply saddened to announce the passing of Eva Kor, Holocaust survivor, forgiveness advocate, and founder of CANDLES Holocaust Museum and Education Center,"" the museum said on its Twitter account. It added that Kor passed away on Thursday in Krakow, southern Poland, during an annual trip organised by the museum that included a visit to Auschwitz, a former Nazi camp in the nearby town of Oswiecim. ""Only five days ago we recorded a testimony of Eva Kor, an Auschwitz survivor, for @AuschwitzMuseum Archive. Today came news about her passing away,"" the Auschwitz Museum said in a tweet late Thursday. ""Broken-hearted to inform you that Ewa Kor has passed away and will be buried in the US,"" Poland's Chief Rabbi Michael Schudrich told AFP via a text message on Friday that used the Polish spelling of her first name. ""Forgive your worst enemies,"" Kor said in a video recording of her last visit to the Auschwitz Museum posted to its official Facebook page. ""The moment I forgave the Nazis, I felt free from Auschwitz and from all the tragedy that had occurred to me,"" she added. Kor also said that for her, combatting the racial prejudice that can lead to genocide is as simple as ""treating each other with respect and fairness."" ""That doesn't take big laws, that doesn't take any government,"" she added. Kor testified in the 2015 trial of former SS officer Oskar Groening, the so-called Bookkeeper of Auschwitz, who was accused on 300,000 counts of being an ""accessory to murder"" of Hungarian Jews. During the trial, Kor described her experiences at the hands of Mengele, who had a fascination for twins. She and her twin sister, Miriam, were 10 years old and managed to survive the regular mystery injections from Mengele, who was dubbed the ""Angel of Death"". Kor recalled how, suffering a high fever, she saw Mengele at her bedside, ""laugh sarcastically"". ""Too bad, she's so young. She has only two weeks to live,"" she recalled him saying. Crawling on the floor because she was unable to walk, Kor said she went on to find her sister who had been injected with a substance to freeze the growth of her kidneys. ""If I had died, Miriam would have been killed with an injection in the heart. Mengele would have performed comparative autopsy,"" she said. On January 27, 1945, the two sisters watched as Russian soldiers liberated Auschwitz. ""They had smiles on their faces. They gave us chocolate, cookies and hugs. That was our first taste of freedom,"" Kor said. Kor's parents and two other sisters perished at the death camp. Auschwitz-Birkenau was built by Nazi Germany in occupied Poland. With one million Jews killed there between 1940 to 1945, the camp has become a symbol of Adolf Hitler's genocide of the European Jews. More than 100,000 other people also perished there, including non-Jewish Poles, Roma, Soviet prisoners of war and anti-Nazi resistance fighters.

In a sign of heightening tensions, France, Germany and Britain — all parties to the deal — expressed concerns over Tehran's decision. In a live news conference, senior Iranian officials said Tehran would keep reducing its commitments every 60 days, unless European signatories of the pact protect it from U.S. sanctions imposed by President Trump. ""We are fully prepared to enrich uranium at any level and with any amount,"" said Behrouz Kamalvandi, spokesman for Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation. ""In a few hours the technical process will come to an end and the enrichment beyond 3.67% will begin,"" referring to the limit set in the 2015 agreement. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the step was extremely dangerous and again called on Europe to impose punitive sanctions on Tehran, raising the prospect of fresh regional tensions. ""The enrichment of uranium is made for one reason and one reason only - it's for the creation of atomic bombs,"" he said. Tehran shows no sign of caving in to pressure from Trump in a confrontation that has taken on a military dimension, with Washington blaming Tehran for attacks on oil tankers, and Iran shooting down a U.S. drone, prompting aborted U.S. air strikes. The Europeans, who object to Trump's withdrawal from the deal last year, have so far failed to salvage the pact by shielding Iran's limping economy from U.S. sanctions. French President Emmanuel Macron condemned Iran's decision as a ""violation"" of the pact which the United States pulled out of last year. Iran has broken the terms of the deal and must immediately stop and reverse its activities, a spokesman for Britain's Foreign Office said on Sunday. ""While the UK remains fully committed to the deal, Iran must immediately stop and reverse all activities inconsistent with its obligations,"" said the Foreign Office spokesman. A German foreign ministry spokesman gave a similar response. Space for Talks? Iran did leave some room for negotiations. All measures taken by Iran to scale back its commitments to the nuclear deal were ""reversible"" if the European signatories of the pact fulfilled their obligations, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted on Sunday. The Iran nuclear deal dispute resolution mechanism will not be triggered for now, said a source at Macron's Elysee office. The French government is giving itself until July 15 to try to get all parties talking again. Under that so-called snapback, if a series of steps designed to resolve differences fails, sanctions in all previous U.N. resolutions would be re-imposed. Inspectors from the U.N. nuclear watchdog who are in Iran will report back once they have checked that Tehran has enriched uranium to a higher level of purity than that allowed under its nuclear deal, the agency said Daniel Byman, senior fellow for foreign policy at the Brookings Institution, said Iran was engaged in a tricky balancing act. “The step is meant to show domestic audiences that Iran is standing up to U.S. pressure. It is also meant to convey a sense of risk to European audiences that Iran may provoke a crisis,"" he said. Under the pact, Iran can enrich uranium to 3.67% fissile material, well below the 20% it was reaching before the deal and the roughly 90% suitable for a nuclear weapon. Kamalvandi said Iran would enrich uranium for use in fuelling its Bushehr power plant, to the level of 5%, confirming what Reuters reported on Saturday. Pressure on Europeans Long-tense relations between Tehran and Washington deteriorated in May 2018 when Trump withdrew from the deal reached before he took office, and reimposed sanctions - saying the agreement did not go far enough, and did not address Iran's missile programme or its policies in the Middle East. Tehran says its missile programme is defensive. Iran has expressed frustration over what it says is the failure of parties to the agreement to salvage the pact - signed along with Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia - by protecting Iran's economic interests from U.S. sanctions. ""European countries have failed to uphold their commitments and they are also responsible,"" Abbas Araqchi, Iran's senior nuclear negotiator, told the news conference in Tehran. ""The doors of diplomacy are open but what matters are new initiatives which are required."" Under the 2015 deal between Iran and six powers, most international sanctions against Tehran were lifted in return for limitations on its nuclear work. Iran's main demand - in talks with the European parties to the deal and as a precondition to any talks with the United States - is to be allowed to sell its oil at the levels before Washington pulled out of the agreement and restored sanctions. ""The Iranian government is trying to create a crisis that will force a multilateral negotiation without precipitating a war,"" said Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

The leaders discussed ways to ""strengthen economic and financial cooperation"" and also reviewed security matters in the wake of ""Iranian threats"" to regional waterways, the Saudi Press Agency said. Hammond's visit comes after Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman reiterated last month that state-owned Aramco's much-delayed initial public offering - dubbed as potentially the world's biggest stock sale - would take place in late 2020 or early 2021. Saudi Arabia has not announced where the listing will be held, but London, New York and Hong Kong have all vied for a slice of the much-touted IPO. Hammond was accompanied by London Stock Exchange chief David Schwimmer and investment minister Graham Stuart on his two-day visit to Jeddah that began on Saturday, according to a British government statement. Saudi Arabia plans to sell up to five percent of the world's largest energy firm and hopes to raise up to $100 billion. The planned IPO forms the cornerstone of a reform programme envisaged by Prince Mohammed to wean the Saudi economy off its reliance on oil. Hammond's visit comes after an apparent setback in relations last month when Britain temporarily suspended approving new Saudi arms export licenses that might contribute towards the kingdom's five-year bombing campaign in neighbouring Yemen. The decision came after a British court ordered the government to ""reconsider"" the sales due to their toll on the civilian population in Yemen. The conflict has claimed tens of thousands of lives, according to relief agencies, and triggered what the United Nations describes as the world's worst existing humanitarian crisis.

The move to start enriching uranium above the agreed maximum purification level of 3.67 per cent comes despite opposition from the European Union and the United States, which has quit the deal. President Hassan Rouhani's order to exceed the threshold would be implemented ""in a few hours"" after the last technical details were sorted, Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi said live on state television. Rouhani initially flagged Tehran's intentions on May 8, exactly a year on from US President Donald Trump unilaterally abandoning the multilateral deal. He has said the move is in response to a failure by remaining state signatories to keep their promise to help Iran work around biting sanctions reimposed by the US in the second half of last year. Deputy foreign minister Abbas Araghchi on Sunday singled out Iran's declining oil sales as one of the main issues that needed to be solved, or Tehran would further step back from its commitments. ""We hope we can reach a solution otherwise after 60 days we will take the third step as well,"" he said, without specifying what the further measures would involve. French President Emmanuel Macron told Rouhani of his ""strong concern"" over the risk of weakening the nuclear agreement and the consequences that would follow during a telephone call Saturday, according to a statement from the Elysee Palace. However, the two leaders agreed to ""explore by July 15 the conditions for a resumption of dialogue between all parties"", the statement said, adding that Macron would consult with Iranian authorities and international partners to bring about the ""necessary de-escalation"" of the situation over the coming days. It is not yet clear how far the Islamic republic will boost enrichment. But a top advisor to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei hinted on Friday it could reach five percent. The 2015 deal was reached between Iran and six world powers — Britain, China, France, Germany, the United States and Russia — and saw Tehran agree to drastically scale down its nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief. Washington began reimposing sanctions in August 2018 and has targeted crucial sectors including oil exports and the banking system, fuelling a deep recession. The 3.67 percent enrichment limit set in the agreement is sufficient for power generation but far below the more than 90 percent level required for a nuclear warhead. Rouhani has stressed that Iran's action would be reversed if the other parties provided relief from the US sanctions, insisting his country's policies are not meant to ""hurt (the deal), but to preserve"" it. France has warned Tehran that it would ""gain nothing"" by leaving the deal and has said ""challenging the agreement would only increase tensions"" in the Middle East. Iran says that it is not violating the deal, citing terms of the agreement allowing one side to temporarily abandon some of commitments if it deems the other side is not respecting its part of the accord. The diplomatic chiefs of Britain, France, Germany and the EU have said they were ""extremely concerned"". Trump, meanwhile, has warned Iran that it is ""playing with fire"". Iran says it exercised ""strategic patience"" for a year after the US withdrawal, waiting for the other signatories to make good on promised economic benefits. But on May 8, Tehran announced it would no longer respect two key limits — a 1.3-ton maximum for heavy water reserves and a cap of 300 kilogrammes on its low-enriched uranium stockpile. The IAEA has in recent days confirmed that Iran has breached the limit of 300 kilogrammes and has scheduled a special meeting on Iran's nuclear programme for July 10. Also on May 8, Tehran gave a 60-day ultimatum — a deadline that expires Sunday — to deal partners to help it circumvent US sanctions, on pain of abandoning two more nuclear commitments. One was the enrichment cap. The other was a freeze on construction of a heavy water reactor. Rouhani referenced the reactor Wednesday, telling critical powers ""according to you, (this) is dangerous and can produce plutonium"". Europe has sought to salvage the nuclear deal by setting up a payment mechanism known as INSTEX which is meant to help Iran skirt the US sanctions. But Rouhani has dismissed the mechanism as ""hollow"" because it has not facilitated purchases of Iranian oil.

Islamist Taliban fighters detonated a car bomb in Ghazni city near an office of the country's main intelligence unit, National Directorate of Security (NDS), during Sunday morning's rush hour, officials said. ""Dozens of NDS officers were killed or wounded,"" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement. Health officials in Ghazni said 13 adults, including eight NDS members, and a child were killed. At least 27 children were among the 140 people wounded. ""The casualty figures may rise as this is not the last report of those injured in the powerful blast,"" said Zaher Shah Nekmal, a health director in Ghazni province. The blast in a crowded area of Ghazni city was the latest in a wave of near-daily attacks by the Taliban, who now hold sway over about half of Afghanistan and continue to intensify attacks on Afghan forces despite increased US efforts towards a peace agreement to end the 18-year war. The attack came hours before Taliban officials were to begin meeting a group of Afghan delegates in Qatar as part of diplomatic efforts to end years of violence and build trust between Afghan civilians and the militant group. The Taliban, who have repeatedly refused to negotiate with the Western-backed government of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, agreed to join the intra-Afghan summit on the condition that those there would attend in a personal capacity. About 60 high-profile Afghan figures and activists were in Doha to meet the Taliban officials during the two-day conference, a meeting arranged by German and Qatari officials with the support of U.S. negotiators. U.S. and Taliban officials will reconvene on Tuesday. The warring sides started a seventh round of peace talks last week, which U.S. special envoy for peace in Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, described on Twitter on Saturday as the most productive session to date. He said substantive progress had been made on all four parts of a peace deal: counter-terrorism assurances, troop withdrawal, participation in intra-Afghan negotiations, and a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire. Military conflict and attacks on civilians have intensified even as the diplomatic process gains momentum, triggering tremendous unease among some Afghans about the significance of holding peace talks with the Taliban. The Taliban took responsibility for detonating a car bomb at the start of a lengthy gun fight outside a defence ministry compound in the capital, Kabul, last week. Six people were killed and more than 100 civilians, including 60 children, were wounded in that attack.

The announcement, confirming what Reuters reported on Saturday, signaled a growing challenge to escalating US sanctions pressure. In a news conference, senior Iranian officials said Tehran would keep reducing its commitments every 60 days, unless signatories of the pact moved to protect it from US sanctions, but they left the door open to diplomacy. Before the deal was sealed, Iran produced 20 per cent enriched uranium needed to fuel its Tehran reactor and the level of enrichment for its southern Bushehr nuclear power plant was 5 per cent. ""We will enrich uranium based on our needs ... right now we don't need to enrich uranium needed for Tehran reactor,"" said Behrouz Kamalvandi, Iran's Atomic Energy Organization spokesman. ""We will enrich uranium to the level that is needed for the Bushehr reactor."" In a sign of heightening Western concern, French President Emmanuel Macron said he and Iran's President Hassan Rouhani had agreed to seek conditions for a resumption of dialogue on the Iranian nuclear question by July 15. Macron's office added that he would keep on talking with Iranian authorities and other involved parties to ""engage in a de-escalation of tensions related to Iranian nuclear issue."" Long-tense relations between Tehran and Washington took a turn for the worse in May 2018 when US President Donald Trump pulled out of the 2015 nuclear deal reached before he took office, and reimposed sanctions. Under the pact, Iran can enrich uranium to 3.67 per cent fissile material, well below the 20 per cent it was reaching before the deal and the roughly 90 per cent suitable for a nuclear weapon.

Iran is acting on its May 8 threat to suspend from Sunday parts of the agreement in response to US President Donald Trump’s reimposition of crippling sanctions after withdrawing from the deal in May last year. The accord capped Iran's enrichment maximum at 3.67%, sufficient for power generation but far below the more than 90% level required for a nuclear weapon. Uranium enrichment “will increase as much as needed for our peaceful activities,” Ali Akbar Velayati, international affairs advisor to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in an interview published Friday on the leader's official website. “For Bushehr nuclear reactor we need five percent enrichment and it is acompletely peaceful goal.” Also on Sunday, Iran’s senior nuclear negotiator will announce more cuts in its commitments to the 2015 nuclear deal, a semi-official news agency reported.

After four years of talks, an agreement to form a 55-nation trade bloc was reached in March, paving the way for Sunday's African Union summit in Niger where attendees will unveil which nation will host the trade zone's headquarters, when trading will start and discuss how exactly it will work. It is hoped that the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) - the largest since the creation of the World Trade Organization in 1994 - will help unlock Africa's long-stymied economic potential by boosting intra-regional trade, strengthening supply chains and spreading expertise. ""The eyes of the world are turned to Africa,"" Egyptian President and African Union Chairman Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said at the summit's opening ceremony. AfCFTA ""will reinforce our negotiating position on the international stage. It will represent an important step."" Africa has much catching up to do: its intra-regional trade accounted for just 17% of exports in 2017 versus 59% in Asia and 69% in Europe, and Africa has missed out on the economic booms that other trade blocs have experienced in recent decades. Economists say significant challenges remain, including poor road and rail links, large areas of unrest, excessive border bureaucracy and petty corruption that have held back growth and integration. Members have committed to eliminate tariffs on most goods, which will increase trade in the region by 15-25% in the medium term, but this would double if these other issues were dealt with, according to International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates. The IMF in a May report described a free-trade zone as a potential ""economic game changer"" of the kind that has boosted growth in Europe and North America, but it added a note of caution. ""Reducing tariffs alone is not sufficient,"" it said. Divergent Interests Africa already has an alphabet soup of competing and overlapping trade zones - ECOWAS in the west, EAC in the east, SADC in the south and COMESA in the east and south. But only the EAC, driven mainly by Kenya, has made significant progress towards a common market in goods and services. These regional economic communities (REC) will continue to trade among themselves as they do now. The role of AfCFTA is to liberalise trade among those member states that are not currently in the same REC, said Trudi Hartzenberg, director at Tralac, a South Africa-based trade law organisation. The zone's potential clout received a boost on Tuesday when Nigeria, the largest economy in Africa, agreed to sign the agreement at the summit. Benin has also since agreed to join. Fifty-four of the continent's 55 states have signed up, but only 25 have ratified. One obstacle in negotiations will be the countries' conflicting motives. For undiversified but relatively developed economies like Nigeria, which relies heavily on oil exports, the benefits of membership will likely be smaller than others, said John Ashbourne, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics. Nigerian officials have expressed concern that the country could be flooded with low-priced goods, confounding efforts to encourage moribund local manufacturing and expand farming. In contrast, South Africa's manufacturers, which are among the most developed in Africa, could quickly expand outside their usual export markets and into West and North Africa, giving them an advantage over manufacturers from other countries, Ashbourne said. The presidents of both countries are attending the summit. The vast difference in countries' economic heft is another complicating factor in negotiations. Nigeria, Egypt and South Africa account for over 50% of Africa's cumulative GDP, while its six sovereign island nations represent about 1%. ""It will be important to address those disparities to ensure that special and differential treatments for the least developed countries are adopted and successfully implemented,"" said Landry Signe, a fellow at the Brookings Institution's Africa Growth Initiative. Regulations governing rules of origin, removal of non-tariff barriers and the development of a payments and settlements system are expected to be unveiled at the summit.

The rally was the first major large-scale protest since last Monday's unprecedented storming of parliament by largely young, masked protesters -- which plunged the international financial hub further into crisis. Hong Kong has been rocked by a month of huge marches as well as a series of separate violent confrontations with police, sparked by a law that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. The bill has since been postponed in response to the intense backlash but that has done little to quell public anger, which has evolved into a wider movement calling for democratic reforms and a halt to sliding freedoms in the semi-autonomous city. Organisers said some 230,000 people snaked their way through streets in the harbour-front district of Tsim Sha Tsui, an area popular with Chinese tourists. Police said 56,000 turned out at the protest's peak. The march was billed as an opportunity to explain to mainlanders in the city what their protest movement is about. Inside China, where news and information are heavily censored, the Hong Kong protests have been portrayed as a primarily violent, foreign-funded plot to destabilise the motherland, not a mass popular movement over Beijing's increased shadow over the semi-autonomous hub. ""We want to show tourists, including mainland China tourists what is happening in Hong Kong and we hope they can take this concept back to China,"" Eddison Ng, an 18-year-old demonstrator, told AFP. Hong Kongers speak Cantonese but protesters were using Bluetooth to send leaflets in Mandarin -- the predominant language on the mainland -- to nearby phones, hoping to spread the word to mainlanders by digital word of mouth. ""Why are there still so many people coming out to protest now?"" one man said in Mandarin through a loudspeaker. ""Because the Hong Kong government didn't listen to our demands."" Many protest banners were written with the Simplified Chinese characters used on the mainland, not the Traditional Chinese system used in Hong Kong and Taiwan. And a lawmaker had to coach crowds how to chant ""Students are not rioters"" using the correct Mandarin pronunciation. Protesters are demanding the postponed extradition bill be scrapped entirely, an independent inquiry into police use of tear gas and rubber bullets, amnesty for those arrested, and for the city's unelected leader Carrie Lam to step down. Beijing has thrown its full support behind Lam, calling on Hong Kong police to pursue anyone involved in the parliament storming and other clashes. In an interview with the BBC on Sunday, China's ambassador to Britain said the extradition bill was needed to ""plug loopholes"" and that Beijing has ""full confidence in the Hong Kong government"". Sunday's protest began on the waterfront -- the first time a rally has taken place off the main island -- and made its way to West Kowloon, a recently opened multi-billion-dollar station that links to China's high-speed rail network. Police placed the glass and steel structure in virtual lockdown. Long lines of water-filled security barriers surrounded the station while only those with previously purchased tickets were being allowed in. Ticket sales for Sunday afternoon were halted and only two entrances were open. Protesters, some of them masked, faced off with police and chanted ""Add Oil!"", a Cantonese phrase for encouragement long embraced by protesters. But there were no clashes. The terminus is controversial because Chinese law operates in the parts of the station dealing with immigration and customs, as well as the platforms, even though West Kowloon is kilometres from the border. Critics say that move gave away part of the city's territory to an increasingly assertive Beijing. Local politician Ventus Lau Wing-hong, one of those organising the rally, said there was no desire to occupy the station given the catalyst for their movement was opposing people being sent to the mainland. Under Hong Kong's mini-constitution China's national laws do not apply to the city apart from in limited areas, including defence. Hong Kong also enjoys rights unseen on the mainland, including freedom of speech, protected by a deal made before the city was handed back to China by Britain in 1997. But there are growing fears those liberties are being eroded. Among recent watershed moments critics point to are the disappearance into mainland custody of dissident booksellers, the disqualification of prominent politicians, the de facto expulsion of a foreign journalist and the jailing of democracy protest leaders.

Affectionately known as Pak Topo (Mr Topo), Nugroho was the face of government efforts to get word out on the latest developments in a string of natural disasters, including a quake-tsunami that killed thousands on Sulawesi island in 2018. He died early Sunday at a hospital in Guangzhou, China, where he was undergoing treatment for cancer which had spread to his bones and several vital organs, Indonesia's disaster agency said. ""We all feel we have lost Pak Sutopo. (He was) the foremost and indomitable figure in delivering disaster information in Indonesia,"" the agency said in a statement on Instagram. The disaster in the city of Palu highlighted Nugroho's refusal to pass the torch as he dragged himself to daily press briefings, taking reporters' calls and communicating on social media at a frantic pace even as the non-smoker got treatment for Stage IV lung cancer. Pale and visibly thinner than in the past, Nugroho got the grim news in January 2018 that he was dying and might have as little as a year to live. Nugroho -- who is survived by his wife and two children — held a PhD in natural resources and the environment, with an expertise in hydrology and cloud-seeding. He spent years as a researcher and dreamed of becoming a professor, rejecting offers to take up the government spokesman job three times until his then boss convinced him that his background would earn him the public's trust. He took the position in 2010. Widely recognised in Indonesia, Nugroho regularly updated his nearly 200,000 followers on Twitter and 70,000 followers on Instagram. He reportedly promised his wife to slow down his work schedule but still managed to get out a 200-word update on a deadly landslide back in February 2018 from his hospital bed, local media reported. Then in August of that year, he was sending out reports on a deadly quake disaster on Lombok island, next to Bali, minutes after finishing a chemotherapy session. Nugroho said he had more than 3,000 contacts in his mobile phone while his social media feeds are filled with updates and dramatic images showing the aftermath of quakes, tsunamis, landslides and volcanic eruptions. He saw himself as a public servant to the end. ""It's not about how long your life is,"" he said. ""It's about what you do in your lifetime.""

The international financial hub has been rocked by a month of huge peaceful protests as well as a series of separate violent youth-led confrontations sparked by a proposed law that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. Compared to the huge optimism-tinged pro-democracy ""Umbrella Movement"" rallies in 2014, the recent protests have been darker and more desperate, culminating in the storming of parliament last Monday by hundreds of young, masked demonstrators. The movement has also taken on a distinctly funereal tone, publicly mourning at least four people who have taken their own lives in recent weeks after leaving political messages. Experts stress that most suicides have complex, multiple triggers and have warned that depicting the four as ""martyrs"" to the protestors' cause risks encouraging copycat acts. An army of social workers, counsellors and other volunteers have mobilised across the city to address a spike in demand for mental health services. ""These students are gambling their youth to defend this place, it's very fragile,"" said Roy Kwong, a pro-democracy lawmaker with a social work background who has been praised for trying to keep demonstrators from harm. Winnie Ng, a counsellor and drama therapy practitioner who has volunteered in recent weeks, said many young Hong Kongers were under huge stresses before the latest protests. She pointed to huge inequality in the cramped city, the world's most unaffordable property market, a pro-Beijing local government that has faced down demands for greater freedoms and the failure of the 2014 protests. ""I personally think when everything in life is related to politics, it pushes life in Hong Kong into a very dejected state,"" Ng told AFP. ""Many people really can't see hope"". Data points to an uptick in calls for help. The Samaritans told South China Morning Post that calls to its line were up five times in the last month. Support platform Open Up said some days had seen spikes of 200 and 450 text messages seeking help during the protests compared to its usual average of 60-80, local newspaper Ming Pao reported. - 'Last straw' - Paul Yip, director of the Centre for Suicide Research and Prevention at the University of Hong Kong, said the extradition bill was ""just the last straw to kill the camel"" and that the youth despair currently on display was ""like an eruption of a volcano"". The suicides have been an especially troubling phenomenon, with shrines popping up at the locations where they happened and regular vigils. But Yip warned against linking the deaths solely to politics. ""Studies have shown that people who killed themselves had suffered from multiple and interacting causes,"" he told AFP. He said the tributes and memorials offered ways for people to express their emotions, which they should not suppress. But he warned that rhetoric characterising deaths by suicide as heroism or martyrdom risks other students taking their own lives. After weeks of remaining silent on the issue, Hong Kong's government addressed the recent suicides on Friday evening with chief secretary Matthew Cheung saying they would mobilise NGOs to devote more time and resources to combating youth depression. ""We realise that many people are feeling unhappy at this present moment,"" he told reporters. Hong Kong's suicide rate is around 12 per 100,000 -- higher than the World Health Organization's average for mainland China at eight per 100,000. - 'Everyone counts' - Amid the despairing tone of the recent protests, the city has also embraced open discussions of mental health, an often delicate subject in the largely conservative culture. Two slogans -- ""Every one of us counts"" and ""We go up and down together"" -- have become rallying cries for mental health awareness. Hong Kong enjoys rights unseen on the mainland, including freedom of speech, protected by a deal made before the city was handed back to China by Britain in 1997. But there are growing fears those liberties are being eroded. Among recent watershed moments critics point to are the disappearance into mainland custody of dissident booksellers, the disqualification of prominent politicians, the de facto expulsion of a foreign journalist and the jailing of democracy protest leaders. A government push to integrate Hong Kong further into mainland China has also led many to feel the city's unique Cantonese language and culture is being undermined. Shai Dromi, a cultural and comparative-historical sociologist at Harvard University, said collective trauma is often tied to the loss of group identity. ""It really touches on fears of not being able to practise one's culture, one's rights, one's religion,"" he said.

He has been accused of diverting the funds collected in the name of charity to Al Qaeda, the official added. On Saturday, Nawaz was presented before an anti-terrorism court, which handed him over to the CTD for three days for further interrogation. According to the FIR, there were intelligence reports that Nawaz, Mohammad Farooq Awan, Shah Rum and Mohammad Naeem were providing funds to terrorists. It said that the CTD received a communique from the Federal Investigation Agency against them, alleging that they were receiving huge sums in the name of charity, which were being diverted to Al Qaeda to be used for terrorism. It said that millions of rupees had been transacted from 11 bank accounts of the charity and Nawaz was unable to provide satisfactory answers regarding these funds. The suspect was then booked under Section 11-N of the ATA, 1997, the paper reported. Representatives of the international non-governmental organisation were unavailable for comments when approached, the paper said. The move comes as the US, the UK, France and some other prominent countries voiced concern over Pakistan's failure to do enough to contain terror funding on its soil. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which placed Pakistan on the grey list in June last year of countries whose domestic laws are considered weak to tackle the challenges of money laundering and terrorism financing, asked Islamabad to complete its action plan against terror funding by October or face action.

Shehbaz, 67, served as the chief minister of the politically crucial Punjab province from 2013 to 2018. He became PML-N president after his elder brother and three-time prime minister Nawaz Sharif was disqualified as the party president following a Supreme Court verdict in 2017.

He has been questioned that when one department was working then why the formation of the company was deemed important. Another question is that were all the legal requirements completed for the formation of the company. Another question is that why ISTEK was awarded the contract without bidding. He was already facing corruption cases against him in the 56 companies' case, Ashiana-e-Iqbal Housing Society scam, Ramzan Sugar Mills case and others.

Addressing a press conference in Lahore on Saturday alongside the top leadership of the PML-N, Maryam, the daughter of 69-year-old Sharif, said that her father's entire judicial process was severely compromised. مسلم لیگ ن کی پریس کانفرنس نے پوری قوم کو ورطہ حیرت میں ڈال دیا ہم تو ایک عرصے سے کہہ رہے ہیں کہ نیب ایک احتسابی نہ… https://t.co/ey1RF4uw8q &mdash; Maulana Fazl-ur-Rehman (@MoulanaOfficial) 1562434974000 Sharif has been serving a seven-year prison term at the Kot Lakhpat Jail in Lahore since December 24, 2018 when the accountability court convicted him in the Al-Azizia Steel Mills case - one of the three corruption cases filed in the wake of the apex court's July 28, 2017 order in Panama Papers case. Sharif and his family have denied any wrongdoing and allege that the corruption cases against them were politically motivated. Maryam claimed Accountability Court Islamabad Judge Arshad Malik, who sentenced Sharif to a seven-year imprisonment in the Al-Azizia corruption case, confessed in his conversation with PML-N supporter Nasir Butt that he was ""blackmailed and forced (by hidden forces)"" to give verdict against the former premier. The video purportedly shows the judge speaking to Butt and claiming that he was coerced to hand down the prison sentence against Sharif despite there being no proof of corruption against him. The Imran Khan government termed the leaked video ""doctored"" and demanded its forensic audit, saying that ""it is an attack on the judiciary."" Maryam said this was a ""divine help"" as her father failed to get justice in cases against him. She said Judge Malik had categorically declared that there was no evidence of money laundering, commission or any other wrong financial transaction against Sharif but he had ""orders to send him jail for which I am repenting."" The judge was ""blackmailed"" into handing down the sentence against Sharif after some people threatened that they would release a private video of his, she alleged. She said the judge did not write the sentence but ""was made to write"" the prison sentence for Sharif. She claimed the judge was under immense pressure to send the former prime minister to jail, and that he had contemplated committing suicide several times since. Maryam said after the revelation of the video her father should not be kept behind the bars any more. She also hinted to use this video in the bail case of Sharif in Islamabad high court.

A former Delaware senator who served under America's first black president Barack Obama, Biden stirred controversy last month when he said he'd ""got things done"" with the late southern senators James Eastland and Herman Talmadge, both of whom supported racist policies. Eastland ""never called me 'boy,' he always called me 'son,'"" Biden had said in remarks that sparked condemnation from several of his competitors seeking the Democratic nomination to face Republican President Donald Trump in next year's election. Biden had remained defiant and refused to apologize, but on Saturday reversed course. ""Was I wrong a few weeks ago to somehow give the impression to people that I was praising those men who I successfully opposed, time and again? Well, yes, I was, and I regret it. And I'm sorry for any of the pain or misconception they may have caused anybody,"" Biden said during a speech in South Carolina. ""Should that misstep define 50 years of my record for fighting for civil rights, racial justice in this country? I hope not,"" he said. Though he still polls at the top of the crowded Democratic field, Biden saw his standing slip following his first debate appearance in which California Senator Kamala Harris confronted him over racial issues. She accused him of opposing the busing of black students to schools in white neighborhoods during the 1970s as part of desegregation efforts, a standout moment during the debates which stretched over two nights. Polls released following the debates showed growing support for Harris, the only black female in the race, while Biden's fell. On Friday, Biden told CNN he was surprised by Harris's attack, but said he wasn't concerned because ""the American people think they know me.""

"70113214"|"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/california-governor-says-earthquakes-are-a-wakeup-call/articleshow/70113214.cms"|"[PTI]"|"RIDGECREST ( US): The two major earthquakes that hit Southern California should alert people across the nation of the need to be prepared for natural disasters, the state's governor said as officials expressed relief that the damages weren't worse. Gov. Gavin Newsom said Saturday that governments must strengthen alert systems and building codes, and residents should make sure they know how to protect themselves during an earthquake. ""It is a wake-up call for the rest of the state and other parts of the nation, frankly,"" Newsom said at a news conference to update the public on the state's efforts to help the region hit by earthquakes on Thursday and Friday. Friday's earthquake was the largest one Southern California in nearly 20 years. Officials voiced concerns about the possibility of major aftershocks in the days and even months to come. No fatalities or major injuries were reported after the 7.1-magnitude quake, which jolted an area from Sacramento to Mexico and prompted the evacuation of the Navy's largest single landholding, Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake in the Mojave Desert. The quake struck at 8:19 p.m. Friday and was centered 11 miles (18 kilometers) from Ridgecrest, the same area of the desert where a 6.4-magnitude temblor hit on Thursday. It left behind cracked and burning buildings, broken roads, obstructed railroad tracks and leaking water and gas lines. The light damage was largely due to the remoteness of the area where the earthquake occurred, but Newsom cautioned after touring Ridgecrest that ""it's deceiving, earthquake damage. You don't notice it at first."" Newsom estimated more than USD 100 million in economic damages and said President Donald Trump called him to offer federal support in the rebuilding effort. ""He's committed in the long haul, the long run, to help support the rebuilding efforts,"" Newsom said of Trump. Only 28,000 people live in the Ridgecrest area, which is sandwiched between more populated areas of Southern California and Las Vegas' Clark County. But seismologists warned that the area could see up to 30,000 aftershocks over the next six months. April Hamlin said she was ""already on edge"" when the second quake rattled her Ridgecrest home. She and her three kids initially thought it was another aftershock. ""But it just kept on intensifying,"" Hamlin said. ""The TV went over, hanging by the cord. We heard it break. We heard glass breakage in the other rooms, but all we could do was stay where we were until it stopped."" With the possibility of aftershocks and temperatures forecast to reach 100 degrees (38 Celsius) over the next several days, officials were taking precautions. The California National Guard was sending 200 troops, logistical support and aircraft, Maj. Gen. David Baldwin said. The Pentagon had been notified, and the entire California Military Department was put on alert, he said. Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake said in a Facebook post that nonessential workers were evacuated and operations halted. The epicenters of both quakes were on the base, and officials said they are continuing to assess damage. Officials said most employees live off the base and in Ridgecrest, but they authorized the evacuation so those who live on base can be eligible for reimbursements. The California Office of Emergency Services brought in cots, water and meals and set up cooling centers in the region, Director Mark Ghilarducci said. State highway officials shut down a 30-mile (48-kilometer) section of State Route 178 between Ridgecrest and the town of Trona southwest of Death Valley because of a rockslide and severe cracking. The move left Trona temporarily cut off. California Department of Transportation spokeswoman Christine Knadler said crews worked through the night to patch the roadway, but it remained rough and uneven. Ron Mikulaco, 51, and his nephew, 23-year-old Brad Fernandez, stood on 178 on Saturday looking at the cracks. The pair drove from Huntington Beach, about 170 miles (274 kilometers) southwest of Ridgecrest. Mikulaco, an amateur geologist, wanted to show his nephew ""the power of Mother Nature,"" and they had the epicenter's latitude and longitude coordinates ready. ""We put that in the GPS, and we'll get as close as we can,"" Fernandez said. In Ridgecrest, local fire and police officials said they were initially swamped by calls for medical and ambulance service. But police Chief Jed McLaughlin said there was ""nothing but minor injuries such as cuts and bruises, by the grace of God."" Two building fires — one involving a mobile home — were quickly doused, McLaughlin said, and natural gas lines where leaks were reported were shut off. When asked to describe what he has been going through in the past two days, the chief said: ""Grief, shock and then, for me, pride in what I've seen from here, my people. It's been a vast range of emotions, and I think the whole community's going through that."" In Trona, a town of about 2,000 people considered the gateway to Death Valley, fire officials said up to 50 structures were damaged. San Bernardino County Supervisor Robert Lovingood said FEMA delivered a tractor-trailer full of bottled water because of damage to water lines. Newsom declared a state of emergency for the county. Julia Doss, who maintains the Trona Neighborhood Watch page on Facebook, said the only food store in town is a Family Dollar store that was shuttered Saturday.

According to a motion filed by US Attorney Richard Donoghue, authorities are ""entitled to forfeiture of all property that constitutes or is derived from the defendant's narcotics-related crimes."" Based on prices for drugs quoted by various witnesses, Guzman's 25-year reign atop the Sinaloa cartel netted sales of some $11.8 billion in cocaine, $846 million in marijuana and $11 million in heroin, authorities said. The money was laundered and used to pay the cartel's workers and suppliers, as well as used to purchase communications equipment and ""planes, submarines and other vehicles."" ""The government need not prove that the defendant can pay the forfeiture money judgment; it need only prove by a preponderance of evidence that the amount it seeks is forfeitable,"" prosecutors said. Guzman's lawyer, Jeffrey Lichtman, told US media that the demand is ""largely an academic exercise as the government has never located or identified even a penny of this $12.7 billion in proceeds supposedly generated by Mr. Guzman."" Guzman, 62, was found guilty in February following a three-month trial for trafficking hundreds of tons of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamines and marijuana to the United States over the course of 25 years. He was also convicted on money laundering and weapons possession charges by jurors who heard how he had beaten, shot and even buried alive those who got in his way. A former El Chapo associate said during the trial that the drug kingpin lived a lavish lifestyle in the 1990s — the height of his power — with four jets for traveling the world, a beachfront mansion in Acapulco and a private zoo on his sprawling estate in Guadalajara. It was not clear which assets Guzman still possesses following his extradition to the United States in January 2017 and which have been transferred to family and friends. Guzman is set to be sentenced on July 17, and is expected to be ordered to spend the rest of his life in prison.

Trump's recitation of highlights from American history in his Fourth of July speech detoured into a mashup of war and centuries. He segued from the War of Independence to modern times and back to the War of 1812 so fast that it seemed he thought George Washington's forces seized airports, ages before airplanes existed — though he did not state that was his belief. ""The teleprompter went out,"" Trump said Friday. ""Right in the middle of that sentence it went out."" He added: ""I knew the speech very well so I was able to do it without a teleprompter."" The White House did not release a text of the speech that had been prepared for him so it's not known what he meant to say. As a light rain fell, he told the crowd about 15 minutes before the end of his event: ""The Continental Army suffered a bitter winter of Valley Forge, found glory across the waters of the Delaware and seized victory from Cornwallis of Yorktown. Our army manned the air (unintelligible), it rammed the ramparts. It took over the airports. It did everything it had to do. And at Fort McHenry, under the rockets' red glare, it had nothing but victory. And when dawn came, their star-spangled banner waved defiant."" — July 4 speech. Trump then proceeded in a more chronological fashion, mentioning the Civil War and the world wars. The Battle of Fort McHenry took place in 1814, when Americans repulsed a British attempt during the War of 1812 to take over Baltimore. It inspired the poem and song that became the national anthem more than a century later, ""The Star-Spangled Banner.""

Parm Sandhu, currently serving as Temporary Chief Superintendent with the Metropolitan Police, claims she was denied promotions and opportunities at work due to her race and gender. The first hearing in her case is set to take place at an employment tribunal next week. “At this early stage, we are unable to comment further around defending the claim,” the Met Police said in a statement. Sandhu is being backed by the Metropolitan Black Police Association, which says it is concerned about the lack of senior female ethnic minority officers. The 54-year-old officer took the legal step at the end of an internal Met Police investigation which exonerated her of gross misconduct last month. The inquiry, launched in June 2018, focussed on whether Sandhu encouraged her colleagues to support her nomination for a Queen's Police Medal (QPM), which is awarded twice a year by Queen Elizabeth II as part of her honours' lists. The medals are given to serving police officers in the UK in recognition of distinguished service or outstanding courage in the line of duty. ""A temporary chief superintendent currently attached to human resources was served with a gross misconduct notice on Wednesday 27 June and has been placed on restricted duties,” said a Met Police statement at the time. The UK's National Police Chief Council guidelines say that ""any person can nominate any other person for an honour"". However, as with other honours, people are not expected to nominate themselves and are not meant to contribute to or know about the process. The internal Met Police investigation concluded last month that Sandhu had ""no case to answer"" and would face no further action, with restrictions on her duties at work being lifted. Mick Creedon, the former chief constable of Derbyshire Police, who acted as her mentor and submitted a statement to the misconduct inquiry, has offered support for her legal battle, according to the BBC. Sandhu, who joined the police service in 1989, rose through the ranks to become Borough Commander in Richmond-upon-Thames. She is one of the most senior ethnic minority female officers in the Met Police and in 2006 received an Asian Women of Achievement Award for her achievements in the police force.

Ballot papers have been dispatched to around 166,000 Conservative Party members around the UK to choose between Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson as the new Tory leader, who will take charge at 10 Downing Street. The process of dispatch is to be completed by Monday and the vote closes at 5pm on July 22. The results will be announced the following day. According to the BBC, some members have already received two ballot papers. In some cases, because members live and work in different constituencies and may have joined local Conservative Associations in both areas.

Christie's auction house sold the 28.5-centimetre (11-inch) relic for USD 5,970,000 at one of its most controversial auctions in years. No information about the buyer was disclosed. The famous pharaoh's finely-chiselled face -- its calm eyes and puffed lips emoting a sense of eternal peace -- came from the private Resandro Collection of ancient art that Christie's last parcelled off for Pounds 3 million in 2016. But angry Egyptian officials wanted Thursday's sale halted and the treasure returned. About a dozen protesters waved Egyptian flags and held up signs reading ""stop trading in smuggled antiquities"" outside the British auction house's London sales room. ""This should not be kept at home. It should be in a museum,"" Egyptian national Magda Sakr told AFP. ""It is history. It is one of our most famous kings,"" the 50-year-old said. Egypt's antiquities ministry said it would hold a special meeting at the start of next week to discuss its next steps in the standoff. ""The Egyptian government will take all the necessary measures to recover Egyptian antiquities that left Egypt illegally,"" it said in statement. Former Egyptian antiquities minister Zahi Hawass told AFP by telephone from Cairo that the piece appeared to have been ""stolen"" in the 1970s from the Karnak Temple complex just north of Luxor. ""We think it left Egypt after 1970 because in that time other artefacts were stolen from Karnak Temple,"" Hawass said. The Egyptian foreign ministry had asked the UK Foreign Office and the UN cultural body UNSECO to step in and halt the sale. But such interventions are rare and made only when there is clear evidence of the item's legitimate acquisition by the seller being in dispute. Christie's argued that Egypt had never before expressed the same level of concern about an item whose existence has been ""well known and exhibited publicly"" for many years. ""The object is not, and has not been, the subject of an investigation,"" Christie's said in a statement to AFP. The auction house has published a chronology of how the relic changed hands between European art dealers over the past 50 years. Its oldest attribution from 1973-74 places it in the collection of Prince Wilhelm of Thurn and Taxi in modern-day Germany. This account's veracity was called into doubt by a report from the Live Science news site last month suggesting that Wilhelm never owned the piece. Wilhelm was ""not a very art-interested person,"" his niece Daria told the news site. Tutankhamun is thought to have become a pharaoh at the age of nine and to have died about 10 years later. His rule would have probably passed without notice were it not for the 1922 discovery by Britain's Howard Carter of his nearly intact tomb. The lavish find revived interest in ancient Egypt and set the stage for subsequent battles over ownership of cultural masterpieces unearthed in colonial times. Tutankhamun became commonly known as KingTut and made into the subject of popular songs and films. International conventions and the British government's own guidance restrict the sale of works that were known to have been stolen or illegally dug up. The British Museum has been wrangling for decades with Greece over its remarkable room full of marble Parthenon friezes and sculptures. Egypt's own campaign to recover lost art gained momentum after numerous works went missing during the looting that accompanied former president Hosni Mubarak's fall from power in 2011. Cairo has managed to regain hundreds of looted and stolen artefacts by working with both auction houses and international cultural groups. But it was never able to provide evidence for the Tutankhamun bust being illegally obtained. Christie's told AFP that it would ""not sell any work where there isn't clear title of ownership"".

Negotiations have had fresh momentum in recent weeks after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, at the end of last month. At the time, he said Washington was hopeful of an agreement before September 1. The appointment last year of Zalmay Khalilzad as a US special peace envoy began the accelerated effort to find a negotiated end to Afghanistan's war and America's longest military engagement. Since then Khalilzad has held scores of talks with the Afghan government in Kabul and abroad, with the Taliban as well as with Afghanistan's neighbours — including Pakistan which has been accused of aiding the insurgents. The US official in Qatar's capital, Doha, where the Taliban maintain a political office and talks are being held, told The Associated Press that the US ""definitely did not offer"" an 18-month withdrawal as part of a peace deal. Speaking anonymously because of the sensitivity of the talks, the US negotiator was responding to a timeframe Taliban officials told the AP months earlier. The US negotiator said the deal being negotiated in Doha with the Taliban is ""comprehensive and includes specifics on all four parts including a cease fire, timeline, participating in intra-Afghan negotiations and counter-terrorism assurances."" On Saturday, several prominent Afghan figures left Kabul for Doha ahead of much-anticipated all-Afghan talks to begin on Sunday. The talks are co-sponsored by Germany and Qatar, and include the Taliban. An earlier round of intra-Afghan talks, which were to be held last April, were scuttled after the two sides could not agree on participants. The Afghan government had submitted a list of 250 people. The Taliban likened it to a wedding party. This time the Taliban say 60 people will participate. Attaullah Rahman Salim, the deputy head of the government's high peace council, said 64 would be sitting around the table. The list includes former mujahedeen who fought the Soviet in the 1980s as well as former government officials, former ambassadors, civil society representatives and a smattering of women. Participants at the table will be there as ordinary Afghans ""on equal footing"" and not as government representatives, said the German sponsors. The Taliban who have consistently refused to hold direct talks with President Ashraf Ghani's government calling it a puppet administration. They have, however, readily agreed to talks with any Afghan, including from within the government, but as an ordinary Afghan. Ghani, who has been conspicuously quiet about the upcoming intra-Afghan dialogue, has consistently demanded Taliban talk directly with the government.

Maithripala Sirisena said he was opposed to the draft Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) that the two countries are negotiating to further strengthen their military ties. Sirisena is at loggerheads with his pro-Western Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. ""I will not allow any agreement that undermines our independence and sovereignty,"" Sirisena told a public rally in the island's south. ""Several agreements currently being discussed are detrimental to our country."" ""I will not allow the SOFA that seeks to betray the nation. Some foreign forces want to make Sri Lanka one of their bases. I will not allow them to come into the country and challenge our sovereignty."" The SOFA seeks to ensure reciprocal access to port facilities and allow freer entry to military personnel and their contractors. Sirisena said there will be no bilateral agreements ""against Sri Lanka's national interest"" as long as he was in office. His term ends in January. He did not name the powers he accused of trying to gain a military foothold in his Indian Ocean island republic of 21 million people. However, it was a thinly veiled reference to the US which is keen on strengthening their existing military cooperation. A year ago, Washington announced it was granting $39 million to boost maritime security in Sri Lanka as China developed its strategic hold on the Indian Ocean island. Increased US interest in Sri Lanka comes as China is upping investment in ports and other building projects on the island, which is a key link in Beijing's ambitious ""Belt and Road"" infrastructure initiative. The US had stopped arms sales to Sri Lanka during the height of the island's Tamil separatist war that ended in 2009. The global power has also been highly critical of the human rights record of the former government of strongman president, Mahinda Rajapakse. Several senior military commanders from the Rajapakse regime have been denied visas to visit the US. China has vowed to keep providing financial help, including loans, to Sri Lanka despite warnings about the island nation's mounting debt. Sri Lanka in 2017 granted a 99-year lease on a strategic port to Beijing because of it could not repay Chinese loans for the $1.4 billion project. The port in Hambantota straddles the world's busiest east-west shipping route and also gives a strategic foothold to China in a region long dominated by India.

The decision to cancel the July 14 campaign came as a top general called on the Sudanese people to back the deal, saying the agreement was the start of a ""new phase"" in the history of Sudan. The Alliance for Freedom and Change and the ruling military council agreed on Friday to form a joint ruling body, which in turn is to install a transitional civilian administration -- protesters' main demand. Prominent protest leaders Ahmed al-Rabie and Khalid Omar confirmed to AFP that the civil disobedience campaign had been cancelled. ""It is to give room for the agreement"" to be implemented, Rabie said. A deal is expected to be ready for signing by the two sides early next week, although the draft has postponed the formation of a 300-seat transitional parliament that had been agreed upon in previous talks. The protest umbrella group on Saturday released a new programme of events on social media networks, which makes no mention of the July 14 civil disobedience campaign. The alliance had also previously called for a mass protest against the generals on July 13 -- a date which will mark 40 days since a June 3 pre-dawn raid on a sit-in at army headquarters by men in military fatigues that killed dozens of protesters. The new programme proposed by the alliance says that there will instead be gatherings on July 13 as a ""commemoration"" for those killed in the raid. Omar said the earlier aim of the mass protest and civil disobedience campaign was to ""achieve civilian rule"" through mobilising people on the streets against the generals. ""But now we can assume that civilian rule will be achieved through the agreement,"" he added. Tension between the generals and protest leaders had soared following the raid, and it was only after intense mediation by Ethiopian and African Union envoys that the two sides resumed negotiations and finally reached an agreement on Friday. At least 136 people have been killed since June 3, including more than 100 on that day itself, according to doctors close to the protest movement. The health ministry has given a lower death toll of 78 people killed over the same period. Days after the raid on the sit-in, the protest alliance held a three-day nationwide civil disobedience campaign, which attracted strong participation and hit the country's already dilapidated economy hard. The deputy chief of the ruling military council, General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, on Saturday called for Sudanese citizens to come together to back the deal. ""The agreement that we wanted for a long time has happened,"" Dagalo -- who also heads the feared Rapid Support Forces paramilitary -- said at a rally.

Warplanes and helicopters late Friday carried out air strikes on Mahambel village in Idlib province, killing 13 civilians including the seven children, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. A woman was also killed early Saturday in regime rocket fire on the outskirts of the town of Khan Sheikhun in the south of the province, the Britain-based war monitor said. Idlib, a region of some three million people, many of whom fled former rebel-held areas retaken by the government, is the last major bastion of opposition to the Russia-backed Damascus government after eight years of civil war. The region on Turkey's doorstep is administered by Syria's former Al-Qaeda affiliate Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, but other jihadist and rebel groups are also present. Idlib is supposed to be protected from a major regime assault by a September deal between Moscow and Ankara, but Damascus and its Russian ally have ramped up their deadly bombardment of the region since late April. More than 520 civilians have been killed since then, according to the Observatory. The United Nations says 25 health facilities in the region have been hit, the latest including the second attack in two months on an underground hospital in the town of Kafranbel on Thursday. ""The attacks happened despite the fact that the coordinates of this hospital had previously been shared with the parties to the conflict in a deliberate, carefully planned effort to prevent any attacks on it,"" an UN official said on Friday. ""I am horrified by the ongoing attacks on civilian areas and civilian infrastructure as the conflict in northwest Syria continues,"" said Mark Cutts, UN deputy regional humanitarian coordinator for the Syrian crisis. Syria's war has killed more than 370,000 people and displaced millions since it started in 2011 with a brutal crackdown on anti-government protests.

Murat Cetinkaya, who was appointed to the role in April 2016, had been replaced by Murat Uysal, the decree said, but gave no official reason for the change. There had been recent speculation that Cetinkaya could be replaced amid disagreements with the government on cutting interest rates. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has repeatedly railed against high interest rates and called for them to be lowered in a bid to stimulate growth. Erdogan once called high rates the ""mother and father of all evil"".

Uysal said he would continue to use monetary policy tools ""independently"" while remaining focused on ensuring price stability as his ""main aim"", according to a central bank statement. Uysal, who had served as deputy governor since June 2016, will hold a press conference in the coming days, the bank said.

In the latest flashpoint with authorities, hundreds of protesters blocked roads and chanted slogans at police in the northwestern district of Tuen Mun, an AFP reporter on the scene said. Hong Kong has been rocked by a month of huge peaceful protests as well as a series of separate violent confrontations with police sparked by a law that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. On Monday its parliament was trashed by hundreds of masked, youth-led protesters in unprecedented scenes. Anger towards police is running high after tear gas and rubber bullets were used against demonstrators. Saturday's rally had a much more local cause but feeds into Hong Kongers' anxieties that the city's unique freedoms and culture are being eroded by a resurgent Beijing. A rally was held earlier in the day to ""reclaim"" a park in Tuen Mun where so-called ""dancing aunties"" have sung Mandarin pop songs through loud microphones and danced for generally older men who give them cash donations. Locals say authorities have failed for years to tackle noise complaints caused by the performers. While the afternoon rally ended without incident, large crowds stayed in the vicinity afterwards. The arrival of police to try and move them on sent tensions higher as the crowds refused to move and shouted ""Add Oil!"" -- a Cantonese phrase expressing encouragement that has long been embraced by protesters. In response to the huge backlash, the extradition bill has been postponed by the city's pro-Beijing leaders. But that has done little to quell public anger which has evolved into a wider movement calling for democratic reforms and a halt to sliding freedoms in the semi-autonomous hub. Protesters are demanding the bill be scrapped entirely, an independent inquiry into police use of tear gas and rubber bullets, an amnesty for those arrested and for the city's unelected leader Carrie Lam to step down. Beijing has thrown its full support behind Lam, calling on Hong Kong police to pursue anyone involved in the parliament storming and other clashes. Activists have called for a new protest on Sunday outside a controversial high-speed train terminus where part of the station is administered by Chinese mainland law. The rally is being billed as an opportunity to explain to Chinese tourists what their protest movement is about given news is so heavily censored in the mainland.

Alek Sigley, 29, disappeared around two weeks ago prompting deep concern about his fate, but was freed and flew to Japan on Thursday. Official North Korean news agency KCNA said Sigley had admitted ""he had been spying by collecting our internal information and sharing with others and repeatedly asked for our forgiveness for infringing on our sovereignty"". It said Sigley - one of just a handful of Westerners living and studying in North Korea - had been detained on June 25 for promoting propaganda against the country online, including on specialist website NK News, which rejected the accusations. ""Sigley, upon request by anti-DPRK news outlets such as NK News, on numerous occasions transferred information that he gathered while travelling to every corner of Pyongyang using his status as an international student, including photographs and analysis,"" it said, using the initials of North Korea's official name. ""The government of DPRK has exercised humanitarian forbearance and deported him from our grounds on July 4."" Sigley's detention came just days before a G20 summit and a landmark meeting between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Trump was closely involved in the case of University of Virginia student Otto Warmbier, who was imprisoned during a tour of the authoritarian state in 2016. Doctors said Warmbier suffered severe brain damage while in detention, fell into a coma and died days after arriving back in the United States, aged 22. Sigley was much more familiar with the country and spoke fluent Korean. He organised tours to North Korea, and ran a number of social media sites, which usually had a stream of apolitical content about life in one of the world's most secretive nations. His blog posts focused on everyday Pyongyang - everything from the city's dining scene to North Korean app reviews - and he married his Japanese wife there last year. Chad O'Carroll, director of the NK News, said in a statement on Saturday that Sigley's columns for the site ""presented an apolitical and insightful view of life in Pyongyang"". ""The six articles Alek published represent the full extent of his work with us and the idea that those columns, published transparently under his name between January and April 2019, are 'anti-state' in nature is a misrepresentation which we reject,"" he said. On Friday, Sigley said he was planning to ""return to normal life"" but offered no details of his detention, adding he would not be conducting any interviews or holding a press conference. ""I just want everyone to know I am OK, and to thank them for their concern for my well-being and their support for my family over the past week,"" he said in a statement released by representatives of his family on Friday. However Sigley gave no indication of why he was held, how he was treated or why he was released. It said he would not make any further comment ""at this time or later"". The case was also complicated by Australia's lack of diplomatic representation in North Korea. Sigley specifically thanked Sweden's envoy to North Korea, who helped negotiate his release. Also on Friday, Australia's home affairs minister Peter Dutton cautioned Sigley against returning to Pyongyang. ""My advice will be pretty clear - I would stay in Japan. I would go back to South Korea. I would come back to Australia. All of those would have to be better options before he returns to North Korea,"" Dutton told broadcaster channel Nine.

The research sheds light on what happens to the children of so-called “double-detained” parents — when both a mother and father have been abducted by the state into what it calls “re-education” facilities. The UN says China has detained over one million minority Muslims, mostly Uighurs, since a dramatic escalation of the policy in 2017. Writing in the Journal of Political Risk, German researcher Adrien Zenz presents evidence to show that the Xinjiang authorities pre-empted the risk that kids who had lost both parents to detention centres would be motivated to lash out against the state. The state government issued directives ordering schools to concentrate on Uighur students’ “thought education” — similar to the sort of language used by the state to justify its detention of adults. Schools were ordered to establish “emergency response plans” that include dealing with state-orphaned children, including regular assessments of their state of mind and “psychological counselling”. Satellite images show that around the same time China started expanding the facilities we now know are used for the detention of Uighurs, attached or independent boarding schools also started receiving dramatically increased dormitory facilities. Official reports boast that the children receive “improved Chinese language skills” as well as generally better manners and personal hygiene. China has denied the existence of any state-orphaned minority kids.

Negotiations have had fresh momentum in recent weeks after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, at the end of last month. At the time, he said Washington was hopeful of an agreement before September 1. The appointment last year of Zalmay Khalilzad as a US special peace envoy began the accelerated effort to find a negotiated end to Afghanistan's war and America's longest military engagement. Since then Khalilzad has held scores of talks with the Afghan government in Kabul and abroad, with the Taliban as well as with Afghanistan's neighbours — including Pakistan which has been accused of aiding the insurgents. The US official in Qatar's capital, Doha, where the Taliban maintain a political office and talks are being held, told The Associated Press that the US ""definitely did not offer"" an 18-month withdrawal as part of a peace deal. Speaking anonymously because of the sensitivity of the talks, the US negotiator was responding to a timeframe Taliban officials told the AP months earlier. The US negotiator said the deal being negotiated in Doha with the Taliban is ""comprehensive and includes specifics on all four parts including a cease fire, timeline, participating in intra-Afghan negotiations and counter-terrorism assurances."" On Saturday, several prominent Afghan figures left Kabul for Doha ahead of much-anticipated all-Afghan talks to begin on Sunday. The talks are co-sponsored by Germany and Qatar, and include the Taliban. An earlier round of intra-Afghan talks, which were to be held last April, were scuttled after the two sides could not agree on participants. The Afghan government had submitted a list of 250 people. The Taliban likened it to a wedding party. This time the Taliban say 60 people will participate. Attaullah Rahman Salim, the deputy head of the government's high peace council, said 64 would be sitting around the table. The list includes former mujahedeen who fought the Soviet in the 1980s as well as former government officials, former ambassadors, civil society representatives and a smattering of women. Participants at the table will be there as ordinary Afghans ""on equal footing"" and not as government representatives, said the German sponsors. The Taliban who have consistently refused to hold direct talks with President Ashraf Ghani's government calling it a puppet administration. They have, however, readily agreed to talks with any Afghan, including from within the government, but as an ordinary Afghan. Ghani, who has been conspicuously quiet about the upcoming intra-Afghan dialogue, has consistently demanded Taliban talk directly with the government.

Emergency workers and security forces were being dispatched early Saturday to the epicenter of the shallow earthquake in a remote and sparsely populated area around 150 miles (240 kilometers) northeast of Los Angeles, where it was also felt. No deaths or serious injuries had been reported late Friday evening, but there were reports of building collapses and power outages in the town of Trona, California office of emergency services director Mark Ghilarducci said. There were ""significant reports"" of fires caused by gas leaks, as well as breaks to power, water and communications lines in the region, he told a press conference. California Governor Gavin Newsom said he had requested emergency federal assistance from the White House, and state resources have been activated at their ""highest level."" Newsom later declared a state of emergency for San Bernardino County, expanding on an earlier announcement covering Kern County, near the epicenter of both the quakes this week. A joint task force including around 200 security personnel as well as helicopters and cargo aircraft was being deployed, National Guard Major General David Baldwin said. San Bernardino fire department spokesman Jeremy Kern told CNN there were ""no active searches ongoing"" for trapped casualties. The quake was 11 times stronger than the 6.4-magnitude quake ""foreshock"" the previous day, according to the United States Geological Survey. The two major quakes, along with multiple aftershocks, have revived fears of the ""Big One"" -- a powerful tremor along the San Andreas Fault that could devastate major cities in Southern California. ""This is an earthquake sequence. These earthquakes are related,"" said Caltech seismologist Lucy Jones. There was a 10 per cent chance of Friday's quake being followed by another magnitude 7.0 or higher quake in the next week, she added. In Kern County, where the quake struck near the town of Ridgecrest, some 1,800 residents were without power, fire department chief David Witt said. ""As for injuries reported, nothing but minor injuries and such as cuts and bruises, by the grace of god,"" he said. At least two fires broke out in the area, county supervisor Mick Gleason said, with dozens of fire trucks dispatched. Numerous gas leaks were reported near the epicenter, including the towns of Trona and Argus. ""Firefighters have secured leaks where possible and evacuated residents from homes with leaks that cannot be secured,"" the San Bernardino fire department tweeted. In Los Angeles, the fire department deployed vehicles and helicopters, and reported fallen power lines and localized electricity outages. But Mayor Eric Garcetti said there were ""no reports of serious damage"" reported in the city. ""We are sending an Urban Search and Rescue Task Force Team to Kern County to help with the damage closer to the epicenter,"" he wrote on Twitter. Numerous visitors to Disneyland in Anaheim reported on Twitter that rides were shut for safety inspections after the quake. Patrons at movie theaters in the Los Angeles area evacuated due to the quake. ""Everyone remained calm as the theater began to shake and then the shaking got stronger. We all headed to exits and down the stairs. No panic but one woman sobbing. This one was scary,"" wrote NBC journalist Lester Holt on Twitter. No damage was reported at Los Angeles airport following inspections. In Las Vegas, 150 miles east of the quake, an NBA summer league game was postponed when the tremor hit, causing the scoreboard and several overhead speakers to sway. The earthquake was the largest in southern California since 1999 when a 7.1-magnitude quake struck the Twentynine Palms Marine Corps base, according to The Los Angeles Times. The tremor sent Ridgecrest residents fleeing outside for safety as aftershocks continued, with one woman saying she was ""not comfortable"" about heading back inside for the night. The shaking stops ""for a minute, and then it starts rolling again... it's pretty bizarre. But now at the moment, I'm not comfortable inside,"" said Jessica Kormelink. ""I was actually in the car with my mom. And it just started bouncing up,"" Jessica Weston, a journalist at the Ridgecrest Daily Independent, told CNN.

Ramping up what is usually a civic and communitybased July 4 celebration to a televised national military spectacle, Trump addressed a crowd of many political partisans gathered before the Lincoln Memorial, reciting a sketchy chronicle of the country’s martial spirit and its leadership in technology. Speaking behind a bulletproof screen, Trump’s address was interspersed with an unprecedented flypast by frontline US military aircraft, including the F-35 and F-18 fighter jets, the B-52 bombers, and osprey helicopters. Abrams battle tank and Bradley fighting vehicles were deployed at the site. “For Americans, nothing is impossible,” Trump declared, as he recited a number of American accomplishments throughout the nation’s history, going through the Revolutionary War, the women’s suffrage movement, and the Civil Rights movement. He also chronicled the country’s major technological feats, including the Moon landing, while pledging that there would soon be a US flag planted on Mars. Although Trump spoke of “one people chasing one dream and one magnificent destiny”, a divided America was apparent across the capital, including in the square mile around the Lincoln Memorial commemorating a president who unified the country. Trump supporters rejoiced at his words and the military spectacle. Some of them compared the speech to Martin Luther King’s “I have a Dream” speech that was made from the same venue. But elsewhere, the president’s critics, some of them sporting Make America Gracious Again banners, chanted “America was never great”. A baby Trump balloon, featuring a scowling caricature of an infant Trump in diapers was a presence on the National Mall for much of the day although it was kept out of the president’s line of vision. The speech was not without the usual flubs. At one point, Trump appeared to lose coherence and said the army “took over the airports” from the British during the revolutionary war in the late 1700s, a mystifying claim since airplanes and airports came more than a century later. “Our army manned the air, it rammed the ramparts, it took over the airports, it did everything it had to do, and at Fort McHenry, under the rockets’ red glare, it had nothing but victory,” he rambled, mangling historical facts and dates even though he was reading from a teleprompter.

Sri Lanka's apex body of Islamic scholars, All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama (ACJU), urged Muslims to avoid visits to the central district that contains Kandy on Sunday. In response, BBS said in a statement thousands of monks are expected to gather in Kandy to take a crucial decision on behalf of the country. In a letter to police seen by Reuters, Dilantha Withanage, CEO of BBS, accused Muslim groups including ACJU of trying to sabbotage the Sunday event, by misleading the police with fabricated information and complaints. Sri Lanka has had a history of ethnic and religious violence and was torn for decades by a civil war between separatists from the mostly Hindu Tamil minority and the Sinhala Buddhist-dominated government. The war ended in 2009. In recent years, Buddhist hardliners, led by BBS, have stoked hostility against Muslims, saying influences from the Middle East have made Sri Lanka's Muslims more conservative and isolated. Buddhists make up about 70% of Sri Lanka's 22 million people while Muslims account for 10%. The Buddhist gathering on Sunday comes ahead of presidential polls scheduled to be held either in November or December in which President Maithripala Sirisena, former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe could be possible candidates. Gnanasara, a hardline monk who is accused of inciting violence against Muslims and has been leading the campaign against Islamic extremism, has called for as many as 10,000 Buddhist clergy to attend the meet, in an effort to unite Sinhala Buddhists. The monk, who was released from prison last month after a pardon by Sirisena over contempt of court charges, has also hinted BBS may back a surprise candidate, whose views are more aligned with the group's ideology, to contest the elections. ""We will either mould our political leaders, or we will send them home,"" he said at a press conference on June 21.

A series of agreements were signed between the two countries during Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ongoing visit to Beijing. The Chinese offer far exceeds India's assistance packages which are limited to a few billion dollars at a time. India, which is opposed to China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), has been eager to develop the BCIM corridor. The move from Beijing indicates it is eager to take over the leadership of BCIM, at least in financial terms, political observers said. One of New Delhi's plans is to link India's northeast with Chittagong port in Bangladesh. China's financial investment in Bangladesh now appears to be its second-biggest, after the $60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). The investment continues to be regarded as development of the BCIM corridor in deference to India's views about BRI but it is effectively a BRI investment. Hasina also obtained generous rice aid for tiding over the Rohingya refugee crisis after meeting Chinese Premier Li Keqiang. China will provide 2,500 tonnes of rice for Rohingyas living in Bangladesh after being forcibly displaced from Myanmar. She also presided over the signing of nine agreements between the two countries, covering areas like economic and technical cooperation and investment in electricity development, tourism and culture.

One of the blazes broke out early Thursday afternoon and was burning woodland and agricultural areas, while another two started simultaneously just before midnight Thursday. The blazes led to four villages being evacuated. The fire department said a fourth, a forest fire, broke out in the same area Friday afternoon. The latest blaze was being tackled by firefighting forces already in the area, authorities said. A total of 255 firefighters, four water-dropping planes and three helicopters along with 100 vehicles and earth-moving machinery were battling the flames. Greek authorities said they had activated the European Union's Copernicus Emergency Management Service satellite program to map the affected areas. Earlier Friday, the fire department said that a 64-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of starting the first fire by using a naked flame to burn dried weeds near his house. The man was to appear before a prosecutor in court Friday. Burning dried weeds and other such activities outdoors, such as setting campfires, is banned in Greece from May 1-Oct. 1 as part of measures to prevent forest fires.

Mediterranea Saving Humans tweeted that its ship was off Italy's southernmost island of Lampedusa, just outside Italian territorial waters, and that it has been banned from entering Italian jurisdiction by ministerial decree. The migrants were rescued from a rubber dinghy Thursday off Libya. The NGO said the decree is illegitimate because it can't be applied to a ship carrying people rescued at sea, and because Italy can't ban an Italian-flagged ship from entering its waters. Malta says it will take the migrants in a deal with Italy to take an equal number already in Malta. The deal, announced by Malta late Thursday, appears aimed at avoiding what would be the 21st stand-off since Italy's populist government has begun refusing any port access to humanitarian groups rescuing migrants at sea. Italy has insisted that the Libyan coast guard intervene and the migrants be brought back to Libya, which NGOs say is against maritime law since Libya is not a safe harbor, as emphasized by the bombing of a migrant center this week that killed dozens. Italy argues that the presence of the ships encourages smugglers and that Italy has been unfairly stuck with the burden of managing arrivals from northern Africa for the rest of Europe. The new at-sea drama follows a 17-day standoff between Italy and a German rescue ship that ended when the captain defied orders and forced her way to a dock in Lampedusa's main port. She is under investigation for disobeying orders and allegedly aiding illegal immigration.

The deal has revived hopes for a peaceful transition of power in a nation plagued by internal conflicts and a deepening economic crisis in the wake of nearly three decades of rule by Omar al-Bashir, who was ousted in April. Relations between the military council that took over from Bashir and protest groups broke down when security forces killed dozens of people holding a sit-in on June 3. But African mediators brokered a return to direct talks following huge protests against the military on Sunday. After a second straight day of discussions, the two sides agreed in the early hours of Friday to ""establish a sovereign council by rotation between the military and civilians for a period of three years or slightly more,"" African Union mediator Mohamed Hassan Lebatt told reporters. The first 21 months will be led by the military and the final 18 months by civilians, according to a statement from the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), which has spearheaded the protests. It said the sovereign council would include five military figures and five civilians, with an additional civilian member agreed by the two sides, and that the deal would be finalised by Monday. The deal also includes the formation of an independent technocratic government and a transparent, independent investigation into violent events in recent weeks. The sides agreed to postpone the establishment of a legislative council. They had previously said the Forces for Freedom and Change (FFC) coalition would take two-thirds of a legislative council's seats, before security forces crushed the sit-in outside Khartoum's defence ministry on June 3. Sudanese analyst Khalid al-Tijani said both sides had made concessions in the deal. ""The biggest challenge is to provide trust between the parties to implement the agreement,"" he said, adding that the government would face high expectations and major economic challenges. Celebrations The streets of Omdurman, Khartoum's twin city across the Nile River, erupted in celebration when the news broke, a Reuters witness said. Thousands of people of all ages took to the streets, chanting ""Civilian! Civilian! Civilian!"" Young men banged drums, people honked their car horns, and women carrying Sudanese flags ululated in jubilation. However, some were slow to learn of the deal because of an internet cut ordered by the military last month. ""This agreement opens the way for the formation of the institutions of the transitional authority, and we hope that this is the beginning of a new era,"" said Omar al-Degair, a leader of the FFC. The celebrations continued in Khartoum and Omdurman on Friday morning. ""We have won a victory against injustice,"" said Shihab Salah, a 23-year-old unemployed engineering graduate carrying a national flag. ""Our goal is to achieve freedom and justice and find jobs for young people. Civilian rule and democracy are the future of Sudan."" Bashir was ousted after 16 weeks of protests triggered by a deepening economic crisis that remains unresolved. ""We want conditions to improve after this agreement because we are tired of high cost of prices, medical treatment and education. We want a better life,"" said 54-year-old vegetable seller Abdullah Saleh. General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, the military council's most prominent member and the head of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), was among those announcing the deal. ""We would like to reassure all political forces, armed movements and all those who participated in the change from young men and women … that this agreement will be comprehensive and will not exclude anyone,"" said Dagalo, who is widely known as Hemedti. The FFC accuse the RSF of leading the operation to crush last month's sit-in. Opposition medics say more than 100 people were killed in the dispersal and subsequent violence. The government put the death toll at 62. Amnesty International called for the RSF, which emerged from militias accused of war crimes in the western region of Darfur, to be barred from all policing activities to help secure the deal. Stability in Sudan, a gateway into Africa from the Middle East, is seen as vital in a volatile region, and foreign powers including wealthy Gulf Arab states have been vying for influence in the nation of 40 million.

The council condemned the attack late on Tuesday on the Tajoura detention camp east of Tripoli and ""stressed the need for all parties to urgently de-escalate the situation and to commit to a ceasefire,"" said a joint statement. Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar, whose forces hold eastern Libya and much of the country's south, launched an offensive in early April to wrestle the capital from forces loyal to the UN-recognized Government of National Accord (GNA). Air strikes and ground fighting have since left nearly 1,000 people dead and some 5,000 wounded, the UN's World Health Organization said. The fighting has forced more than 100,000 people to flee their homes and threaten to plunge Libya into deeper conflict. Among the dead are 53 migrants killed Tuesday night in an air raid on a detention center in the Tripoli suburb of Tajoura, held by the GNA, which accused Haftar's forces of carrying out the strike. A Geneva-based spokesman for the International Organization for Migration said six children were among the migrants killed. Joel Millman said that 350 migrants, including 20 women and four children, were still detained at the center, one of five air hangars hit in the raid. World powers have been divided over how to respond to Haftar's offensive, with the United States and Russia refusing to condemn the Libyan strongman. The British-drafted council statement condemned the attack on the migrant camp, called for a return to political talks and for full respect of the arms embargo on Libya. It followed a closed-door council meeting on Wednesday during which US diplomats said they needed more time to consult with Washington on the proposed text. The United Nations has called for an independent investigation to determine who was responsible for the strike on the center, which housed some 600 migrants, mainly from African countries. UN agencies and humanitarian groups have repeatedly voiced concern over the plight of thousands of migrants and refugees held in detention centers near combat zones in the capital. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has expressed outrage over the attack and said the United Nations had shared the coordinates of the detention center with the warring sides to protect the civilians. The carnage in Tajoura was ""a tragedy that should have never happened"", said Charlie Yaxley, spokesman for the UN's refugee agency. Libya has become a major conduit for migrants seeking to reach Europe and remains prey to numerous militias vying for control of the country's oil wealth. Rights groups say migrants face horrifying abuses in Libya, and their plight has worsened since Haftar launched the offensive against Tripoli. According to the UN, some 5,700 refugees and migrants are being held in detention centers in Libya, 3,300 of which are vulnerable to fighting in and around Tripoli. An initial lightning assault in early April saw Haftar's self-styled Libyan National Army steam towards the capital. But they have since been bogged down on its southern outskirts, where frontlines have been frozen for months. The GNA forces launched a surprise counter-attack late last month, seizing the strategic town of Gharyan, the main supply base for Haftar's offensive. After the setback, Haftar's forces threatened to intensify strikes against their rivals. Both sides have launched daily air raids throughout the fighting and each lost several planes. Troops loyal to Haftar said late Thursday they had downed a GNA jet near the town of Tarhuna, used by the LNA as a rear base some 80 kilometres (50 miles) southeast of Tripoli. A GNA spokesman said they had lost contact with the L39 Albatros, which had been on a combat mission south of the capital, without providing further details. The rival camps have remained convinced that with the help of their backers, they can win the battle. The GNA receives support from Turkey and Qatar, and Haftar is backed by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and according to experts, to some degree by the United States.

""If Britain does not release the Iranian oil tanker, it is the authorities duty to seize a British oil tanker,"" Mohsen Rezai said on Twitter. The Gibraltar government said the crew on board the supertanker Grace 1 were being interviewed as witnesses, not criminal suspects, in an effort to establish the nature of the cargo and its ultimate destination. British Royal Marines abseiled onto the ship off the coast of the British territory on Thursday and seized it. They landed a helicopter on the moving vessel in pitch darkness. The move escalates a confrontation between Iran and the West just weeks after the United States called off air strikes minutes before impact, and draws Washington's close ally into a crisis in which European powers had striven to appear neutral. Tehran summoned the British ambassador on Thursday to voice ""its very strong objection to the illegal and unacceptable seizure"" of its ship, a move that also eliminated doubt about the ownership of the vessel. Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said the crude oil cargo was from Iran. The ship's paperwork had said the oil was from neighbouring Iraq, but tracking data reviewed by Reuters suggested it had loaded at an Iranian port. European countries have walked a careful line since last year when the United States ignored their pleas and pulled out of a pact between Iran and world powers that gave Tehran access to global trade in return for curbs on its nuclear programme. Over the past two months, Washington has sharply tightened sanctions against Tehran with the aim of halting its oil exports altogether. The moves have largely driven Iran from mainstream markets and forced it to find unconventional ways to sell crude. The confrontation took on a military dimension in recent weeks, with Washington accusing Iran of attacking ships in the Gulf and Iran shooting down a U.S. drone. President Donald Trump ordered, then cancelled, retaliatory strikes. With nuclear diplomacy at the heart of the crisis, Iran announced this week it had amassed more fissile material than allowed under its deal, and said it would purify uranium to a higher degree than permitted from July 7. CREW ON BOARD The Grace 1 was impounded in the British territory on the southern tip of Spain after sailing the long way around Africa from the Middle East to the mouth of the Mediterranean, a route that demonstrates the unusual steps Iran appears to be taking to try to keep some exports flowing. The Gibraltar spokesman said the 28-member crew, who have remained on board the supertanker, were mainly Indians with some Pakistanis and Ukrainians. Police and customs officials remained on board the vessel to carry out their investigation, but the Royal Marines were no longer present. While the European Union has not followed the United States in imposing broad sanctions against Iran, it has had measures in place since 2011 that prohibit sales of oil to Syria. Gibraltar said on Thursday it had reasonable grounds to believe the Grace 1 was carrying crude oil to the Baniyas refinery in Syria. It made no mention of the ownership of the vessel or the origin of its cargo. Shipping experts say it may have been avoiding the more direct route through the Suez Canal, where a big tanker would typically be required to unload part of its cargo into a pipeline to cross, potentially exposing it to seizure. If officials in Gibraltar have not fully established the nature of the cargo or the final destination, they could in the coming days ask a court for permission to hold the vessel for longer.

""We have recommended to the summit that the actual date of trading should be the 1st of July 2020,"" Albert Muchanga, in charge of trade and industry at the 55-nation bloc, told AFP. ""It is not yet definitive, the summit has to consider that recommendation,"" he said. However, ""the ministers of trade have accepted, so naturally you would expect that the head of states will."" ""I am very optimistic, the passion is spreading and everyone is ready to work hard for the better,"" he added. The launch of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), 17 years in the making, will be the major focus at the AU summit. Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation and the most notable absentee to the deal alongside Benin and Eritrea, announced earlier this week that it would sign up to the AfCFTA in Niamey. Muchanga said the accord, which will progressively phase out duties on 97 percent of goods traded between African countries, would be a spur for growth. ""The biggest benefit is you are removing the fragmentation of Africa,"" Muchanga said, predicting an influx of foreign capital that would create jobs and prosperity. According to the AU, the zone, bringing together Africa's 1.2 billion people into the world's largest trade bloc, could increase intra-African trade by 60 percent by 2022. Some however have feared that cheaper imports will hit small manufacturers and farming families. Some countries would face a short-term hit to revenues but competition would drive innovation, Muchanga said. A billion US dollars (890 million euros) in credit has been earmarked by the African Import and Export Bank for countries requiring support, he announced. ""Countries which will have adjustment costs then can have recourse to that facility which will assist them,"" he said. The pact notionally came into being in late May after crossing the threshold of ratification by at least 22 countries. AU members, after formally launching it Niamey, will then have to hammer out key details to make it operational. Some of these are notorious pitfalls in trade liberalisation talks, say analysts. They include a timetable for lowering customs duties, rules for certifying ""Made in Africa"" products and arbitration mechanisms to settle disputes. Observers also caution that import duties are not the only obstacles to freer business — corruption, decrepit infrastructure and lengthy waiting times at borders are also major deterrents to trade.

Speaking to a gathering of top military officials, Maduro reiterated his support for a negotiation process mediated by Norway between his socialist government and Guaido, the leader of the opposition-held National Assembly who argues Maduro's 2018 re-election was a fraud. ""There is room for all of us within Venezuela,"" Maduro said in a speech in Caracas, before calling for military exercises on July 24 to defend the South American country's ""seas, rivers and borders."" ""We must all give up something in order to reach an agreement,"" he said. Venezuela was plunged into a deep political crisis in January when Guaido invoked the constitution to assume a rival interim presidency, calling Maduro a usurper. He has been recognized as the rightful head of state by dozens of countries, including the United States and most South American neighbors. But Maduro retains the recognition of Cuba, Russia and China, and remains in control of state functions and the armed forces. He calls Guaido a U.S.-backed puppet seeking to oust him in a coup. Guaido held a separate independence day event, calling on supporters to march toward the headquarters of the military counterintelligence directorate, or DGCIM, where navy captain Rafael Acosta died last month after opposition leaders and family members said he was tortured in custody. The march is the first major opposition gathering since a botched Guaido-led military uprising on April 30 and follow-up protests on May 1. The government responded to the failed attempt to oust Maduro with a crackdown on Guaido-aligned lawmakers and military members suspected of involvement. This week, the United Nations human rights chief, former Chilean President Michelle Bachelet, published a report detailing alleged extrajudicial executions, torture, enforced disappearances and other rights violations by Venezuelan security forces in recent years. ""There is no longer any valid euphemism to characterize this regime, other than dictatorship,"" Guaido told reporters earlier on Friday. ""The systematic violation of human rights, the repression, the torture... it is clearly identified in the (UN)report."" The Venezuelan government has called the report ""selective"" and said the UN sources lacked objectivity. A new round of Norway-mediated talks expected for this week was called off after Acosta's death. Opposition leaders frequently argue that Maduro's government seeks to use dialogue to distract from its continued human rights violations. In an apparent referral to Acosta before Maduro spoke, Commander Remigio Ceballos said the armed forces ""regretted the events related to the loss of the retired naval official."" Without naming Acosta, he accused him of conspiring against the Venezuelan state, and said authorities were investigating the circumstances of his death.

Russia and the United States have both suspended their participation in the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF), accusing each other of violating the accord, which banned a whole class of nuclear-capable missiles. Washington will definitively quit the deal on August 2 unless Russia destroys a controversial new missile system the US and NATO say breaches the accord, signed in 1987 between US president Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. NATO held talks with senior Russian officials as part of efforts to save the deal, a week after alliance defence ministers agreed a package of counter-measures in case Moscow ignores the deadline. ""We didn't see any sign of Russia being willing to come back into compliance with the INF treaty,"" Stoltenberg told reporters after the meeting, adding that the ""ongoing Russian violation"" was the only reason the treaty was under threat. He said there was still time to save it, pointing to the speed with which Soviet forces were able to get rid of their medium-range weapons after the INF was signed. ""Back in 1987 Russia was able to destroy intermediate range cruise missiles in a few weeks,"" he said. ""It is possible to do it in a few weeks because that has happened before."" The INF, which banned ground-launched missiles with a range of 500 to 5,500 kilometres, is seen as a cornerstone of the global arms control architecture and its looming demise has triggered fears for the future of the New START treaty, which caps nuclear warhead numbers. Alliance ministers last week agreed to review air and missile defences, along with intelligence and surveillance programmes, to boost their readiness to deal with the threat posed by Russia's new 9M729 ground-launched cruise missiles. Stoltenberg refused to give further details of the measures on Friday, saying NATO was still focused on trying to save the deal, but he said the alliance's existing ballistic missile defence shield would not be capable of shooting down Russian missiles.

Presenting a damning report to the UN Human Rights Council, Michelle Bachelet said that attempting to exercise the most basic rights like freedom of opinion, expression, association and assembly ""entails a risk of reprisals and repression"". ""Essential institutions and the rule of law in Venezuela have been eroded,"" she said. She decried attacks against ""actual or perceived political opponents and human rights defenders ranging from threats and smear campaigns to arbitrary detention, torture, ill-treatment, sexual violence, killings and enforced disappearance."" Venezuela immediately slammed the report, which was published late Thursday and followed a visit by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to the troubled South American country last month. The report ""is dominated by a selective and partial vision,"" William Castillo, Venezuela's deputy foreign minister, told the council, demanding a ""correction"". The report indicated that nearly 7,000 people have been killed during security operations in Venezuela in the past year and a half, according to a count by Caracas, and warned that many of the killings likely constituted ""executions"". The UN rights office described the incidence of alleged extrajudicial killings by security forces in the country as ""shockingly high"". Bachelet stressed to the council Friday that the possible ""extrajudicial killings ... should be fully investigated with accountability of perpetrators, and guarantees of non-recurrence."" In her report, she especially pointed a finger at Venezuela's police special forces (FAES), and urged the authorities to ""dissolve"" the unit. Castillo meanwhile said that Caracas ""categorically rejects the criminalisation of the security forces and the armed forces."" He also lamented that Bachelet had ignored the ""serious risks"" facing Venezuela, pointing to ""coup plans"" and the threat of ""foreign intervention"" from US President Donald Trump. Venezuela is caught in an economic crisis and a political standoff between President Nicolas Maduro's government and National Assembly leader Juan Guaido. The opposition leader, Guaido, declared himself interim president earlier this year, and has been recognised by the United States and more than 50 other countries. The oil-rich nation is also suffering from hyperinflation and shortages of basic goods from food to medicine, a crisis that has forced millions to flee. The UN estimates that more than seven million Venezuelans are in need of urgent humanitarian aid. Bachelet said ""there are reasonable grounds to believe that grave violations of economic and social rights, including the rights to food and health, have been committed in Venezuela."" She added that social programmes had been used ""as an instrument of social control"". The UN rights chief also said the US oil embargo and other sanctions imposed on Venezuela were taking a harsh toll, further exacerbating ""the effects of the economic crisis, and thus the humanitarian situation"". She warned that the punitive measures appeared to be ""affecting the state's ability to provide basic health service to the populations."" Despite her criticism of Caracas, Bachelet refrained from calling for an international investigation into the violations in the country, and said she wanted to give the government the opportunity to carry out reforms without setting a ""deadline"". She hailed increased cooperation from Venezuelan authorities, who granted her broad access during her recent visit and has agreed to a permanent presence by UN rights officers in the country. She especially welcomed the release of 62 detainees around the time of her visit, and 22 more this Thursday, including the journalist Braulio Jatar and the judge Lourdes Afiuni. The UN, she said, ""encourages the authorities to release all others detained for the exercise of their human rights.""

The invitations followed a pledge by Lam to do a better job of listening to the voices of young people. Student leaders said at a news conference that they do not think Lam is being sincere. Her office invited them to closed-door meetings, but the students said any meeting should be public and include a wider representation than just them. ""A closed-door meeting does not have any witnesses to prove what was discussed, the public does not know what the dialogue was about,"" said Jordan Pang from the University of Hong Kong Students' Union. ""The public has the right to know."" Ng Yat Ming, the vice president of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Students' Union, said they would be condemned as traitors if they negotiated with Lam on behalf of the public. ""We believe it is a PR stunt,"" he said. Young people have taken the lead in protesting against the extradition legislation, which many see as a threat to the rights guaranteed to Hong Kong under the ""one country, two systems"" framework that governs the Chinese territory. Lam, who was appointed as Hong Kong's leader by a committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites, suspended the legislation indefinitely after a huge march against it on June 9 and then a June 12 demonstration that blocked access to the legislature and nearby streets. The protesters remain unsatisfied and have escalated their tactics. They are demanding the formal withdrawal of the extradition bill, Lam's resignation, the release of dozens arrested after the protests and an independent investigation into a police crackdown on the June 12 protest that included tear gas and rubber bullets. One protester charged in connection with an hours-long siege by protesters of the police headquarters on June 21 appeared in court Friday, Hong Kong media reported. He was the first of those arrested to do so. Pun Ho-chiu is charged with assaulting eight police officers, damaging walls and escalators at police headquarters and behaving in a disorderly manner, public broadcaster RTHK said on its website. He was denied bail. Pun accused police of mistreating him while in custody, according to the media reports. The judge said the complaints are outside the court's mandate. On Monday, one group smashed through thick windows to break into the legislature building on a national holiday celebrating the return of Hong Kong from Britain to China in 1997. They spray-painted slogans on the walls and damaged the fire prevention and electronic voting systems. The legislature has decided to suspend meeting until October for repairs to the heavily damaged complex.

At Sunday's surprise US-North Korea summit at the demilitarised border between the two Koreas, the North Koreans informed the Americans that former ambassador to Vietnam Kim Myong Gil would act as counterpart to US Special Representative Stephen Biegun, the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the ongoing negotiations. A spokesman for the US Embassy in Seoul declined to comment. South Korean media, citing unnamed diplomatic sources, reported on Thursday that Kim Myong Gil would be taking over for Kim Hyok Chol, the North Korean diplomat who served as Biegun's counterpart ahead of the Hanoi summit, which collapsed with no deal in February. In June, CNN reported that Kim Hyok Chol, a former ambassador to Spain, was alive and in state custody, contradicting a South Korean newspaper report that he had been executed for his role in the summit breakdown. Reuters was unable to independently confirm the accounts. Previously, some North Korean officials who were reported to have been executed or purged reappeared later with new titles. The collapse of the Hanoi summit was a major setback for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who, several sources said, was led to believe by hawkish aides like former general and spy master Kim Yong Chol that he was about to win sought-after sanctions relief in return for a promise to partially scrap nuclear facilities. Kim Yong Chol was also removed from his position as counterpart for US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, but has since appeared at some public events alongside Kim Jong Un. After meeting Kim Jong Un on Sunday, US President Donald Trump said that the two sides had agreed to name teams to resume talks that have been stalled since the previous summit. At the time, Trump said Kim was putting someone in charge ""who we know and like"", but did not name the official. As then-ambassador in Hanoi, Kim Myong Gil played a visible role alongside Kim Jong Un as the leader met Trump and Vietnamese officials. According to a fact sheet by South Korea's Unification Ministry, Kim Myong Gil was previously a member of delegations at the United Nations and the failed six-party talks, aimed at reining in North Korea's nuclear and missile programmes that it pursued for years in defiance of UN Security Council sanctions. The talks included the two Koreas, the United States, Japan, Russia and host China. On April 8, North Korean state media reported Kim Myong Gil was leaving his post as ambassador to Vietnam. If the appointment is confirmed, Kim Myong Gil's long experience as a diplomat could pose opportunities as well as challenges for Biegun, said Duyeon Kim, a Seoul-based adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. ""On the one hand, it will make Biegun's conversations easier because Kim knows 'diplomatic speak' and the issues very well, but his knowledge and experience means that negotiations could also get tricky,"" she said. ""North Korean diplomats pride themselves for knowing the US better than Americans."" It is unclear, however, whether swapping out negotiators would help the talks make progress, Kim said. ""At the end of the day, it almost doesn't matter who the lead negotiator is because they get their marching orders from Kim Jong Un.""

Chants of ""the martyrs' blood has not been shed in vain"" reverberated around the same streets where more than six months of protests culminated in the landmark roadmap for a new political future after the toppling of veteran president Omar al-Bashir in a palace coup in April. The deal, reached in the early hours of Friday after two days of hard-won talks brokered by Ethiopian and African Union mediators, provides for the interim governing body to have a rotating presidency, as a compromise between the positions of the generals and the protesters. The blueprint proposes that a general hold the presidency for the first 18 months of a three-year transition, with a civilian taking over for the rest. The issue had led to weeks of deadlock, which was marred by a brutal raid on a longstanding protest camp outside army headquarters in Khartoum that killed dozens of demonstrators and wounded hundreds on June 3. ""Today we can say that our revolution has embarked on the right path in achieving our goals,"" said north Khartoum resident Somaiya Hassan. ""I think we will be able to change the horrible situation of our people,"" she said, as fellow residents flashed victory signs and waved national flags.

""I intend now to return to normal life but wanted to first publicly thank everyone who worked to ensure I was safe and well,'' Alek Sigley said in a statement released by his family's spokeswoman in Australia, a day after he was flew from Pyongyang to Beijing and then Tokyo to be reunited with his Japanese wife. He asked media to respect his privacy and said he has no plans to hold a news conference. Sigley, 29, had been studying at a Pyongyang university and guiding tours in the North Korean capital before disappearing from social media contact with family and friends on June 25. He had posted about his experiences in North Korea and boasted about the extraordinary freedom he had as one of the few foreign students living there. ""I just want everyone to know I am OK, and to thank them for their concern for my wellbeing and their support for my family over the past week. I'm very happy to be back with my wife, Yuka, and to have spoken with my family in Perth (Australia) to reassure them I'm well,'' he said in the statement. He specifically thanked Sweden's special envoy to North Korea, Kent Rolf Magnus Harstedt, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Foreign Affairs Minister Marise Payne for his release. Swedish diplomats had raised concerns about Sigley with North Korean authorities in Pyongyang, where Australia does not have an embassy. ``This outcome demonstrates the value of discrete behind-the-scenes work of officials in resolving complex and sensitive consular cases in close partnership with other governments,'' Morrison said in Parliament Thursday. In an interview with Swedish public radio, Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom said that Harstedt ``raised the issue of this case at highest level'' in North Korea and the release happened during his visit there. Sigley's father, Gary Sigley, a professor of Asian studies at the University of Western Australia, said Thursday that his son had been treated well in North Korea. It was a much happier outcome than the case of American college student Otto Warmbier, who was convicted of attempting to steal a propaganda poster and imprisoned in North Korea. Warmbier died shortly after being sent back home to the U.S. in a vegetative state in June 2017. ``We should be very fortunate, I think, looking at this, because it could have ended up very differently so a good outcome in the end,'' Australian Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton said Friday. He also had some word of advice for Sigley and other Australians who were thinking of visiting North Korea. ``My advice would be pretty clear. I'd stay in Japan, I'd go back to South Korea, I'd come back to Australia. All of those would have to be better options before he returns to North Korea and we've got advisories out to that effect, warning people,'' he said. ``So there needs to be an application of common sense here and I don't think he'd put himself back in that situation.''

A series of agreements were signed between the two countries during Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ongoing visit to Beijing. The Chinese offer far exceeds India's assistance packages which are limited to a few billion dollars at a time. India, which is opposed to China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), has been eager to develop the BCIM corridor. The move from Beijing indicates it is eager to take over the leadership of BCIM, at least in financial terms, political observers said. One of New Delhi's plans is to link India's northeast with Chittagong port in Bangladesh. China's financial investment in Bangladesh now appears to be its second-biggest, after the $60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). The investment continues to be regarded as development of the BCIM corridor in deference to India's views about BRI but it is effectively a BRI investment. Hasina also obtained generous rice aid for tiding over the Rohingya refugee crisis after meeting Chinese Premier Li Keqiang. China will provide 2,500 tonnes of rice for Rohingyas living in Bangladesh after being forcibly displaced from Myanmar.

Sparked by a law that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, the city has witnessed three huge peaceful rallies as well as civil disobedience and violence from a hard core of younger protesters who have besieged the police headquarters and on Monday stormed the city's parliament. Authorities have vowed to hunt those behind the unrest that has plunged the semi-autonomous city's Beijing-backed government into crisis. Pun Ho-chiu, 31, appeared in court on Friday over his alleged involvement in the blockade of the city's police headquarters on 21 June. He was also charged with disorderly behaviour for throwing eggs at police outside the headquarters during the six-hour siege. A well-known activist nicknamed ""Painter"" for his street art, Pun was remanded in custody and faces up to ten years in jail if convicted. He was one of the only protesters during the police siege to show himself unmasked. In court his lawyer said he was assaulted by police who spoke to him in Mandarin -- the predominant language on the Chinese mainland. The judge said the court could not investigate the claims and directed him to the police complaints procedure. Forensic investigators have been combing through the trashed parliament for fingerprint and DNA evidence to help identify protesters who stormed the building and left its walls daubed with slogans such as ""HK is not China"" and a colonial-era flag pinned to the legislature's podium. An AFP tally shows at least 66 arrests have been announced by police since the protests began. But it is not clear how many of those people have been charged and police did not respond to requests for a breakdown. The unrest presents the most severe challenge to Beijing and Hong Kong's leaders since the city's handover to China. Critics say Beijing has ratcheted up control over the city in recent years, stamping down on dissidents and refusing calls for universal suffrage. While the current protests were sparked by huge public opposition to the extradition bill they have since morphed into a broad anti-government movement. On Friday evening thousands of Hong Kong mothers rallied at a park in the commercial district of Central in support of those who ransacked parliament. Didi Cheng, who has a 25-year-old daughter, told AFP the protesters who stormed the building ""had no other choice"". ""After two mass rallies, the cold-blooded government had no response,"" the 53-year-old said. ""I have to come out to show my support for the youngsters, to tell them I stand with them."" City leader Carrie Lam has postponed the extradition legislation but has failed to quell public anger. Protesters have demanded she withdraw the bill entirely, launch an independent inquiry into police use of tear gas and rubber bullets, and step down. Chief secretary Matthew Chueng -- Lam's de facto deputy -- held talks with pro-democracy lawmakers which he said were ""constructive"" but there was no suggestion of a breakthrough. ""My meeting with the pan-democrats just now was very useful in the sense that it's the first time we've really had an opportunity to sit down and talk candidly and frankly over the issues,"" he told reporters. Since the parliament siege Beijing has vocally thrown its support behind Lam, calling on Hong Kong authorities to pursue all those involved in the ransacking. Multiple university student groups have rejected a request by Lam's administration for closed-door talks, saying they would only meet if the government granted an amnesty to those arrested and held the dialogue in public. Activists have also circulated plans for a new protest on Sunday via the encrypted app Telegram which will take place in Kowloon -- an area of the city popular with mainland Chinese tourists who are subject to heavily censored news across the border.

The statement by Dr Abdul Hafeez Shaikh came a day after the International Monetary Fund formally approved the US $6 billion loan to Pakistan, which is facing ""significant"" economic challenges on the back of ""large"" fiscal and financial needs and ""weak and unbalanced"" growth. Shaikh said that the IMF decision improved the country's standing and other institutions had also started extending their financial support, Dawn news reported. He said that the Asian Development Bank would disburse about US $2.1 billion out of US $3.4 billion agreed to Pakistan this year and the World Bank had also agreed to provide additional assistance purely for budgetary support. Discussions with the World Bank were in progress for assistance only for the purpose of government expenditure, Shaikh said. Giving a breakdown of US $38 billion expected financial support from lenders other than the IMF, Shaikh said that about US $8.7 billion funds had been lined up against project loans, US $4.2 billion for programme loans, about US $14 billion of rollover loans and up to US $8 billion in commercial loans. He did not go into the details and sources of these loans. Responding to a question, the prime minister's advisor said Pakistan's outflows for debt-servicing amounted to US $9.5 billion during the last financial year and projected at US $11.8 billion during the current fiscal year. He said that there had been different exaggerations and unfair comments about the IMF conditions. Shaikh said that there was also no condition or the IMF demand in the programme about the privatisation as it would become clear from the documents to be released by the global lender. Instead, Pakistan has to develop a comprehensive programme to decide which loss making entities could be improved and run in the public sector, which can be better run by the private sector and which require liquidation. He said that the government had given independence to the State Bank of Pakistan so that it emerged as a strong institution like others in the world. Pakistan approached the IMF in August 2018 for a bailout package after the Imran Khan government took over. On Wednesday, the IMF approved a 39-month US $6 billion loan for Pakistan with tough conditions to address its balance of payment crisis and help the country's ailing economy return to ""sustainable growth"". The US $6 billion financial aid includes an immediate disbursement of US $1 billion to help Pakistan address its balance of payment crisis. The latest deal is the 22nd bailout package since Pakistan became a member of the IMF in 1950. Pakistan has so far received billions in financial aid packages from friendly countries like China, Saudi Arabia and the UAE during the current fiscal year.

Wall Street stocks were lower on Friday morning, with investors believing strong June jobs data could make the Fed less likely to cut interest rates this month.

Trump since last year has excoriated the central bank and its chairman, Jerome Powell, in particular, shattering recent political norms according to which presidents refrained from commenting on monetary policy. Powell has brushed off Trump's jibes, insisting on the Fed's political independence. And, while the Fed has raised rates nine times since 2015 as the economy has expanded, rates remain low by historical standards and policymakers since May have signaled that their next move is likely to be a cut. Trump has nevertheless not let up in his pressure on the central bank, seeking to nominate political allies to fill vacancies that could give him a voice on the Fed's board of governors.

The US jobs engine added 224,000 net new positions last month, smashing forecasts, the Labor Department said in the closely-watched report, while the unemployment rate ticked up to 3.7 percent as more workers stepped off the sidelines to enter the labor force. After an unexpectedly weak May, the vigorous June rebound should quiet talk of a steep drop-off in economic activity and delight President Donald Trump as he prepares to seek reelection next year. But it could disappoint stock markets, which had been banking on an interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve following a batch of soft economic data. That rate cut, expected later this month, could now be in doubt. Still, even with the latest numbers, job creation slowed to a monthly average of 172,000 in the first half of the year, down from the 223,000 a month in all of 2018. Wage growth in June short of expectations, as average hourly earnings rose 0.2 percent to $27.90 an hour, slower than the 0.3 percent economists had been expecting. Worker pay was up 3.1 percent over the same month last year, and has been at or above three percent for 11 straight months, steadily outpacing inflation and delivering more purchasing power to workers. Meanwhile, more people came off the sidelines of the labor market making the labor force participation rate -- the share of people available for work compared to the general population -- rise a tenth of a point to 62.9 percent, helping reverse some of the sharp recent declines. That helped drive the jobless rate back up to 3.7 percent, still very low by historical standards.

Ramping up what is usually a civic and community-based July 4 celebration to a televised national military spectacle, Trump addressed a crowd of many political partisans gathered before the Lincoln Memorial, reciting a sketchy chronicle of the country's martial spirit and its leadership in technology. Speaking behind a bullet-proof screen in intermittent rain, Trump's address was interspersed with an unprecedented flypast by frontline US military aircraft, including the F-35 and F-18 fighter jets, the B-52 bombers, and osprey helicopters. ""For Americans, nothing is impossible"" Trump declared, as he recited a number of American accomplishments throughout the nation's history, going through the Revolutionary War, the women's suffrage movement, and the Civil Rights movement. He also chronicled the country's major technological feats, including then Moon landing, while pledging that there would soon be an American flag planted on Mars. Although Trump spoke of ""one people chasing one dream and one magnificent destiny,"" a divided America was visible even in the square mile around the Lincoln Memorial commemorating a President who unified the country. Trump supporters, many of them wearing MAGA (Make America Great Again) rejoiced at his words and the military spectacle as they partied in the rain and broke into chants of ""USA!USA!"" Some of them compared the speech to Martin Luther King's ""I have a Dream"" speech that was made from the same venue. Elsewhere, the President's critics and opponents, some of them sporting Make America Gracious Again banners, chanted slogans against him. A baby Trump balloon, featuring a scowling caricature of an infant Trump in diapers was a presence on the National Mall for much of the day although it was kept out of the President's line of vision. A small group burned American flags outside the White House earlier, resulting the arrest of two people. The speech was not without the usual Trump flubs. At one point, Trump appeared to lose coherence and said the army ""took over the airports"" from the British during the revolutionary war in the late 1700s, a mystifying claim since airplanes and airports came more than a century later. ""Our army manned the air, it rammed the ramparts, it took over the airports, it did everything it had to do, and at Fort McHenry, under the rockets' red glare, it had nothing but victory,"" he rambled, mangling historical facts and dates even though he was reading from a teleprompter. Trump also called America's original 13 Colonies ""the most just & virtuous republic ever conceived,"" even though modern historians take into account its decimation of indigenous people and its practice of slavery and segregation. There were dodgy claims even in the tech front as Trump counted Alexander Graham Bell's telephone as an American gift to the world although Bell was a Canadian citizen at the time of invention and became a US citizen much later. Just how divided the country has become was evident on two oped's that appeared side-by-side in the Washington Post: ""Trump made his critics look small during his 'Salute to America' read one headline"" that praised Trump's speech.

At Sunday's surprise US-North Korea summit at the demilitarised border between the two Koreas, the North Koreans informed the Americans that former ambassador to Vietnam Kim Myong Gil would act as counterpart to US Special Representative Stephen Biegun, the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the ongoing negotiations. A spokesman for the US Embassy in Seoul declined to comment. South Korean media, citing unnamed diplomatic sources, reported on Thursday that Kim Myong Gil would be taking over for Kim Hyok Chol, the North Korean diplomat who served as Biegun's counterpart ahead of the Hanoi summit, which collapsed with no deal in February. In June, CNN reported that Kim Hyok Chol, a former ambassador to Spain, was alive and in state custody, contradicting a South Korean newspaper report that he had been executed for his role in the summit breakdown. Reuters was unable to independently confirm the accounts. Previously, some North Korean officials who were reported to have been executed or purged reappeared later with new titles. The collapse of the Hanoi summit was a major setback for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who, several sources said, was led to believe by hawkish aides like former general and spy master Kim Yong Chol that he was about to win sought-after sanctions relief in return for a promise to partially scrap nuclear facilities. Kim Yong Chol was also removed from his position as counterpart for US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, but has since appeared at some public events alongside Kim Jong Un. After meeting Kim Jong Un on Sunday, US President Donald Trump said that the two sides had agreed to name teams to resume talks that have been stalled since the previous summit. At the time, Trump said Kim was putting someone in charge ""who we know and like"", but did not name the official. As then-ambassador in Hanoi, Kim Myong Gil played a visible role alongside Kim Jong Un as the leader met Trump and Vietnamese officials. According to a fact sheet by South Korea's Unification Ministry, Kim Myong Gil was previously a member of delegations at the United Nations and the failed six-party talks, aimed at reining in North Korea's nuclear and missile programmes that it pursued for years in defiance of UN Security Council sanctions. The talks included the two Koreas, the United States, Japan, Russia and host China. On April 8, North Korean state media reported Kim Myong Gil was leaving his post as ambassador to Vietnam. If the appointment is confirmed, Kim Myong Gil's long experience as a diplomat could pose opportunities as well as challenges for Biegun, said Duyeon Kim, a Seoul-based adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. ""On the one hand, it will make Biegun's conversations easier because Kim knows 'diplomatic speak' and the issues very well, but his knowledge and experience means that negotiations could also get tricky,"" she said. ""North Korean diplomats pride themselves for knowing the US better than Americans."" It is unclear, however, whether swapping out negotiators would help the talks make progress, Kim said. ""At the end of the day, it almost doesn't matter who the lead negotiator is because they get their marching orders from Kim Jong Un.""

Joined by First Lady Melania Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, his cabinet colleagues and top military leadership, Trump in his address to thousands of people said this was an occasion to salute the US soldiers and generals.

We celebrate our history by people, and the heroes who proudly defend our flag, the brave men and women of the United States military,"" said the US President. In his 'Salute to America' address, Trump said the same American spirit that emboldened country's founders has kept its people strong throughout its history. ""To this day that spirit runs through the veins of every American patriot. It lives on in each and every one of you here today. It is the spirit, daring and defiance, excellence and adventure, courage and confidence, loyalty and love that built this country into the most exceptional nation in the history of the world, and our nation is stronger today than it ever was before. it is its strongest now,"" he said. The President recalled the upcoming anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing. He recognised Gene Kranz, the NASA flight director from that mission, and promised someday soon that the US will ""plant the American flag on Mars"". Trump recognised each branch of the armed forces, noting the Space Force would soon be added. He also recognised law enforcement and Gold Star families. ""Our nation has always honoured the heroes who serve our communities. The firefighters, first responders, police, sheriffs ... border patrol and all of the brave men and women of law enforcement. On this July 4th, we pay special tribute to the military service members who laid down their lives for our nation,"" Trump said.

The 6.4 magnitude quake struck at 10:33 a.m. in the Mojave Desert, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) northeast of Los Angeles, near the town of Ridgecrest, California. Multiple injuries and two house fires were reported in the town of 28,000. Emergency crews were also dealing with small vegetation fires, gas leaks and reports of cracked roads, said Kern County Fire Chief David Witt. He said 15 patients were evacuated from the Ridgecrest Regional Hospital as a precaution and out of concern for aftershocks. Kern County District Supervisor Mick Gleason told CNN there were some structural issues with the hospital and some patients had to be moved from one ward to another and that others were taken to a neighboring building. Gleason did not say what the structural issues were. Ridgecrest Mayor Peggy Breeden said that utility workers were assessing broken gas lines and turning off gas where necessary. The local senior center was holding a July 4th event when the quake hit and everyone made it out shaken up but without injuries, she said. ""Oh, my goodness, there's another one (quake) right now,"" Breeden said on live television as an aftershock struck. Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for Kern County. The declaration means that the state will help the county and municipalities in it with emergency aid and recovery efforts. Ridgecrest Mayor Peggy Breeden praised Newsom for declaring the emergency. She also noted at a news conference that other nearby governments have offered to help the recovery effort. President Donald Trump said he was fully briefed on the earthquake and that it ""all seems to be very much under control!"" Police and fire officials said at a news conference Thursday afternoon that they have enough resources so far to meet needs in the wake of the earthquake. Ridgecrest Police Chief Jed McLaughlin said at a news conference that ""we have plenty of resources."" California Highway Patrol Lt. John Williams says officials have found cracks on several roads in the county, but overpasses and underpasses are in good shape. A series of aftershocks included a 4.5 magnitude temblor, according to the United States Geological Survey. ""It almost gave me a heart attack,"" said Cora Burke, a waitress at Midway Cafe in Ridgecrest, of the big jolt. ""It's just a rolling feeling inside the building, inside the cafe and all of a sudden everything started falling off the shelf, glasses, the refrigerator and everything in the small refrigerator fell over."" Video posted online of a liquor store in Ridgecrest showed the aisles filled with broken wine and liquor bottles, knocked down boxes and other groceries strewn on the floor. Flames were seen shooting out of one home in the community. Lucy Jones, a seismologist with the California Institute of Technology's seismology lab, said the earthquake was the strongest since a 7.1 quake struck in the area on October 16, 1999. ""This has been an extremely quiet abnormal time,"" Jones said. ""This type of earthquake is much more normal ... The long term average is probably once every five or 10 years somewhere in Southern California."" Jones said that the 6.4 quake centered near the town of Ridgecrest was preceded by a magnitude 4.2 temblor about a half hour earlier. She said vigorous aftershocks were occurring and that she wouldn't be surprised if a magnitude 5 quake hit but that they were striking in a remote area, sparsely populated area. ""This is an isolated enough location that that's going to greatly reduce the damage,"" she said. People from Las Vegas to the Pacific Coast reported feeling a rolling motion and took to social media to report it. Local emergency agencies also took to social media to ask people to only call 911 for emergencies. ""We are very much aware of the significant earthquake that just occurred in Southern California. Please DO NOT call 9-1-1 unless there are injuries or other dangerous conditions. Don't call for questions please,"" the LAPD said in a statement published on Twitter. There were no reports of serious damage or injuries in Los Angeles, the department said. The quake was detected by California's new ShakeAlert system and it provided 48 seconds of warning to the seismology lab well before the shaking arrived at Caltech in the Los Angeles suburb of Pasadena but it did not trigger a public warning through an app recently made available in Los Angeles County. USGS seismologist Robert Graves said the ShakeAlert system worked properly. Graves said it calculated an intensity level for the Los Angeles area that was below the threshold for a public alert. The limits are intended to avoid false alarms. Ashleigh Chandler, a helicopter rescue EMT at Fort Irwin, California, said the quake happened as she was getting ready for a July 4th party. ""I was just in the living room getting everything ready, we start to feel the shaking, so then I look up and then the wine bottles start rattling and I thought, `They're going to fall.' ""My stepson was in the house and my dog, so we just got everyone outside and then it ended. It was like 15, 20 seconds, maybe. It was pretty good shaking, so I'm out of breath."" ""Everyone's OK."" Glenn Pomeroy, the head of California's Earthquake Authority, said the earthquake is ""an important reminder that all of California is earthquake country."" Pomeroy urged the estimated 2,000 people in the region hit by the quake who have California Earthquake Authority insurance policies to contact the agency as soon as possible. Information on how to file a CEA policy claim is on the agency's website: EarthquakeAuthority.com, he said.

In front of a massive statue of a seated Abraham Lincoln, the heroic 19th century president, Trump used the traditionally politics-free holiday to deliver shoutouts to each arm of the military, as well as singling out first responders and the controversial Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agencies that have been criticised for their treatment of migrants. But he disappointed critics who had warned that Trump, the first president in decades to make a keynote speech on the July 4 holiday, was hijacking the celebration to bolster his own political standing and attack Democratic rivals. President Donald Trump, standing with first lady Melania Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and acting Defense Secretary Mark Esper, and others, watch as the US Navy Blue Angels flyover in front of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington.

We celebrate our history, our people, and the heroes who proudly defend our flag -- the brave men and women of the United States military!"" he said. ""Our nation is stronger today than it ever was before. It is its strongest now,"" he said. Surrounded by the top officers of the Pentagon, and a panoply of invited Republican officials and VIP donors, the event allowed Trump to stake a strong claim to patriotic fervor 16 months ahead of a presidential election with polls showing his potential Democratic rivals holding a significant edge over him. Trump originally wanted a grand military parade for the holiday, ostensibly inspired by France's rollout of its military might on its own national day. But instead, he got a scaled-back version, with some US armored vehicles parked for display and a flyover by the president's own Air Force One jet, the B2 bomber, attack helicopters, and the Navy's Blue Angels flying team. It was a military show that has been absent from the US capital for decades, and Trump's foes blasted it ahead of time as a show of militarism.

She began her racist rant when the crew refused to serve her the fourth bottle. Thereafter, for a long period during the flight, she hurled racial abuses at the crew and at one point, spat on a crew member, swore at her and violently squeezed her arm. TOI was the first to write about the incident in a report carried on November 14, along with a video clip of the abuse the crew suffered at the hands of the unruly passenger. According to UK media reports, Burns was arrested after the plane landed at Heathrow Airport. Burns, 50, was found guilty by a UK court and was sentenced to six months in April.

Christie's auction house expects the 28.5-centimetre (11-inch) quartz relic to fetch more than £4 million ($5 million, 4.5 million euros) at one of its most controversial auctions in years. The famous pharaoh's finely-chiselled face -- its calm eyes and puffed lips emoting a sense of eternal peace -- comes from the private Resandro Collection of ancient art that Christie's last sold in 2016 for £3 million. But angry Egyptian officials want the sale halted and the treasure returned. Christie's decision ""contradicts international agreements and conventions,"" Egypt's foreign ministry said on Wednesday. Former antiquities minister Zahi Hawass told AFP that the piece appears to have been ""stolen"" in the 1970s from the Karnak Temple complex. ""We think it left Egypt after 1970 because in that time other artefacts were stolen from Karnak Temple,"" Hawass said. Christie's counters that Egypt had never before expressed the same level of concern about a bust whose existence has been ""well known and exhibited publicly"" for many years. ""The object is not, and has not been, the subject of an investigation,"" it said in a statement to AFP Wednesday. The auction house has published a chronology of how the relic changed hands between European art dealers over the past 50 years. Its oldest attribution from 1973-74 places it in the collection of Prince Wilhelm of Thurn and Taxi in modern-day Germany. Yet that account was called into doubt by a report from the Live Science news site last month suggesting that Wilhelm never owned the piece. Wilhelm was ""not a very art-interested person,"" his niece Daria told the news site. A journalist and art historian who knew Wilhelm told Live Science site that the prince had no arts collection at all. Tutankhamun is thought to have become a pharaoh at the age of nine and to have died about 10 years later. His rule would have probably passed without notice were it not for the 1922 discovery by Britain's Howard Carter of his nearly intact tomb. The lavish find revived interest in ancient Egypt and set the stage for subsequent battles over ownership of cultural masterpieces unearthed in colonial times. Tutankhamun became commonly known as King Tut and made into the subject of songs and films. International conventions and the British government's own guidance restrict the sale of works that were known to have been stolen or illegally dug up. The British Museum has been wrangling for decades with Greece over its remarkable room full of marble Parthenon friezes and sculptures. Egypt's own campaign to recover lost art gained momentum after numerous works went missing during the looting that accompanied former president Hosni Mubarak's fall from power in 2011. Cairo has managed to regain hundreds of looted and stolen artefacts by working with both auction houses and international cultural groups. But Egypt has been unable to substantiate its case with firm proof that the Tutankhamun bust was illegally obtained. Christie's told AFP that it would ""not sell any work where there isn't clear title of ownership"".

The Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority said Wednesday there were 63,072 tourist visits to Sri Lanka last month, a drop of 57% compared with June 2018, when the number was 146,828. The highest numbers were from India, followed by Australia, the United Kingdom and China. Almost 97% of tourists arrived by air. Arrivals for the first six months of the year were 1,008,449, a decline of 13.4 % compared with 2018, when 1,164,647 visitors arrived. Seven suicide bombers struck two Catholic and one Protestant church and three luxury hotels on April 21. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attacks, which were carried out by a local radicalized Muslim group known as National Thowheed Jammath. The blasts killed more than 250 people, including 45 foreigners mainly from China, India, the U.S. and the U.K. Tourism was Sri Lanka's third largest foreign currency earner last year, after remittances and textile and garment exports. Tourism accounts for 4.9% of Sri Lanka's GDP. Last year, 2.3 million tourists visited, generating $4.4 billion, a nearly 12% jump from 2017. Around half a million Sri Lankans directly depend on tourism while 2 million depend on it indirectly. The government expected an income of $5 billion from tourism this year, but after the blast, it said revenue would decline to $3.7 billion.

Thirteen other people were sentenced to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment by the Pabna court, according to media reports. On September 23, 1994, Hasina was leading a nationwide election campaign by rail and holding rallies at different stations. As her train reached Pakshey railway station in Pabna’s Ishwardi, it was attacked with crude bombs and gunshots. The attack continued till Ishwardi railway station. Hasina survived the assault carried out during BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia’s first term as prime minister. Expressing satisfaction over the verdict, public prosecutor Akteruzzaman Mukata said, “After a long legal battle, the court punished all 47 charge-sheeted accused according to proper witness and evidence.” Meanwhile, lawyers of the convicts rejected the verdict and said they will appeal to a higher court. The railway police, as plaintiff, had initiated a case against 135 people in connection with the attack. But the probe reportedly hit a snag during the BNP’s rule before picking up speed once the Awami League formed government in 1996. Police later submitted a charge sheet against 52 accused. Out of the 52 accused, five died during the trial proceedings. After the verdict, local BNP activists held a protest on the court premises while ruling Awami League supporters and activists held separate procession expressing satisfaction over the judgement. Hasina’s administration has been accused of suppressing dissent and jailing critics, including supporters of the BNP. Zia is in jail on corruption charges that she said were politically motivated.

The bill aims to stop multinationals from avoiding taxes by setting up headquarters in low-tax EU countries. Currently, the companies pay nearly no tax in countries where they have large sales like France. The bill foresees a 3% tax on the French revenues of digital companies with global revenue of more than 750 million euros ($847 million), and French revenue over 25 million euros. The bill adopted by the National Assembly goes to the Senate next week, where it is expected to win final approval. The tech industry warns it could lead to higher costs for consumers. It could affect US companies including Airbnb and Uber as well as those from China and Europe. It primarily targets those that use consumers' data to sell online advertising. The French finance ministry has estimated the tax will raise about 500 million euros ($566 million) a year this year but that should increase ``quickly.''

Rome's historic centre is on security lockdown for the visit with 50 streets blocked to traffic and Italian media reporting that mobile phone signals could be scrambled. Putin will be driven around in his six-metre-long (20-foot) armoured limo by a chauffeur who has been practising negotiating his way around the Eternal City's narrow streets. His talks with Italian leaders should be easier. Far-right Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini has often expressed admiration for Putin, and his coalition government advocates reviewing EU sanctions against Russia. On the eve of the visit, Putin praised Salvini and his Lega party for having a ""welcoming attitude"" to Russia. ""They are pushing for a rapid abolition of the anti-Russian sanctions introduced by the US and the EU,"" Putin said in an interview with Corriere della Sera. The US and EU have progressively imposed sanctions on Russia since its annexation of Crimea in 2014 and Moscow's involvement in the conflict in eastern Ukraine, including the shooting down of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17. Salvini has previously visited Moscow and been pictured in pro-Putin T-shirts. When his party won most Italian votes in May's European elections, Salvini posted a photo of himself with a picture of Putin in the background. ""Men like him (Putin) who act in the interest of their own citizens, there should be dozens in this country"", Salvini said last year. The Kremlin says Putin wants to discuss Russia-EU relations, the situation in Syria, Ukraine and Libya and Iran's nuclear programme. An EU summit last month extended economic sanctions targeting whole sectors of the Russian economy, including its crucial oil and gas industry, until the end of 2019. Italy has not vetoed the sanctions but the EU front appears less united thanks to Rome's pro-Russian overtures. Before talks with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and President Sergio Mattarella, Putin will have his third meeting with Pope Francis. Their last encounter was in 2015 when the pope urged all parties to the conflict in Ukraine to make a ""sincere effort"" for peace. The meeting lasted an unusual 50 minutes. Only audiences with former US President Barack Obama and French President Emmanuel Macron have been longer. Francis first met Putin in 2013, as the Roman Catholic Church sought to improve ties with the Russian Orthodox Church. Only in 2009 did the Vatican and Moscow re-establish full diplomatic ties which had been severed during Soviet times. Relations have improved since the coming to power in the same year of Patriarch Kirill, who headed up the Russian Orthodox Church's diplomatic arm for years. The Russian Orthodox Church has frequently accused the Catholic Church of proselytising in Russia, an Orthodox Christian country of 144 million. The pope in 2016 held a historic meeting with Kirill in Cuba, the first encounter between the heads of the two largest Christian churches since Christianity split into Western and Eastern branches in the 11th Century -- an event known as ""The Great Schism."" Kremlin advisor Yuri Ushakov said on Wednesday that ""for the time being a possible invitation for the pope to visit Russia is not on the agenda."" The pope and Putin will discuss ""preserving Christian holy sites in Syria"", the Kremlin said. Salvini and fellow Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio will attend a dinner for Putin in the evening, after which the russian president will meet his old friend and former premier Silvio Berlusconi, known for his sex scandals and ""bunga bunga"" parties.

The inquiry is preliminary and has been overshadowed by the ongoing trial, which centres on the 2011 purchase of a Nigerian oilfield by Eni and oil major Shell, but it is gathering momentum, said three sources familiar with the probe. Milan prosecutors have been questioning a growing number of people, and Eni itself is under investigation, over suspicions that a few company officials tried to discredit two key prosecution witnesses in the corruption case, the sources said. Eni has said in public statements that it knew of no attempt to obstruct justice and would consider itself a victim if any crime of obstruction were shown to have been committed. ""Eni declares itself an offended party from any point of view linked to alleged activities aimed at diverting any investigations carried on by any Italian prosecuting authority,"" the company said further in a statement to Reuters. Prosecutors have not laid any charges against Eni officials or the group itself and their investigation may not lead to charges. The 18-month-old probe is adding to the legal workload of top management, which has begun an internal investigation into possible obstruction, a source with knowledge of the matter said. In the corruption case, Eni and Shell are accused of buying Nigeria’s OPL 245 offshore oilfield in the knowledge that the vast majority of the $1.3 billion purchase price would be siphoned off to agents and middlemen in corrupt payments. Eni and Shell have denied any wrongdoing in that case, one of the industry's biggest corruption scandals. They are being tried in Milan along with some of their managers, including Eni Chief Executive Claudio Descalzi, who have also denied wrongdoing. In the obstruction investigation, prosecutors are looking into whether in 2015 and 2016 Eni's then head of legal affairs, Massimo Mantovani, and other yet-to-be-identified Eni officials sought to discredit two independent board members who later became witnesses in the Nigeria case, the three sources said. One of the two directors, Luigi Zingales, who has since left the board, told Reuters that at the time of the possible obstruction he and fellow independent director Karina Litvack were critical of the group's handling of the Nigeria case, including its oversight of a broker firm used in the deal. Litvack, still an Eni director, declined to comment. Eni lawyers denied in trial hearings that the company's anti-corruption controls were inadequate and in a statement to Reuters, the company said its governance and controls were effective, now and at the time of the oilfield purchase. ""Overall, Eni does not consider the statements by its former director Prof. Zingales a reasonable proxy to assess the governance and contractual functioning of ENI on OPL 245."" Prosecutors are reviewing whether Mantovani, who now works for a European subsidiary of Eni, directed a conspiracy to file false criminal complaints against the two directors, alleging they had criminally defamed CEO Descalzi, the three sources added. Mantovani, whose Rome and Milan offices were searched by prosecutors in February 2018, has denied any wrongdoing. His lawyer declined a request for comment. The Nigeria case was still in an investigative stage when the complaints were made against Zingales and Litvack, alleging they had defamed Descalzi by implicating him in corruption over the Nigeria purchase, the sources added. The anonymous complaints were investigated and dismissed by a Milan judge in September 2017. Court records in the Nigeria graft trial show that the two directors never testified that Descalzi had known or was involved in corruption, only stating that Eni had lacked proper anti-corruption controls. 'WRONG END OF THE STICK' Milan prosecutors are investigating whether a former legal adviser to Eni, Piero Amara, also took part in the suspected plot to discredit the two directors by passing the false complaints to prosecutors' offices in southern Italy, sources said. Amara's Rome house and offices have been searched as part of the investigation, most recently in May, they added. The prosecutors are looking into whether Amara was paid for his part in the alleged obstruction of justice, via a commercial transaction involving an Eni trading subsidiary and another oil-trading company that they believe belonged to him, Napag. In May 2018, the Eni subsidiary, Eni Trading and Shipping (ETS) -- at the time chaired by Mantovani -- paid 25 million euros for a polyethylene purchase from Napag, sources said. Napag did not respond to request for comment. Amara's lawyer, Salvino Mondello, told Reuters that Milan prosecutors ""got the wrong end of the stick"", saying his client had no involvement in Napag and was only a customer who had friendly relationships with the company. ""The prosecutors' idea that Amara is protecting Eni's management is proven wrong by the facts,"" Mondello said.

The family division court case scheduled on July 30 pits Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum against Princess Haya, daughter of the late King Hussein of Jordan and an accomplished Olympic equestrian on friendly terms with horse aficionado Queen Elizabeth II. The hearing is expected to focus on who will have custody of their two young children now that the princess has left Dubai. She is believed to be in Britain, where she owns a gated mansion on Buckingham Palace Gardens, a private street lined with some of the world's most expensive homes and cars. When The Associated Press asked via intercom for an interview with Princess Haya or one of her representatives, a man emerged to say there would be no comments made on her behalf. He didn't indicate whether she was in the residence. The clash between Sheikh Mohammed and Princess Haya is the latest sign of trouble in his extended family. Last year, a daughter of Sheikh Mohammed tried to flee Dubai after appearing in a 40-minute video saying she had been imprisoned on and off for several years and had been abused. Her friends say she was forcibly returned after commandos stormed a boat carrying her off the coast of India when she tried to flee the Emirates. The Sheikh, who is the vice president and Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates in addition to being the ruler of Dubai, is among the most influential figures in the Middle East. He also composes poetry, a long tradition among Gulf Arabs, and it was his own words that sparked the initial rumours that Haya had fled Dubai. The talk started after a verified Emirati Instagram account followed by the Dubai ruler's son posted a poem last week attributed to Sheikh Mohammed. The poem, titled ""You Lived and You Died,"" is about disloyalty, leading to speculation it is about Princess Haya. ""You betrayed the most precious trust, and your game has been revealed,"" the poem says. ""Your time of lying is over and it doesn't matter what we were nor what you are."" The harsh words caused reverberations and speculation throughout royal circles in the Middle East and beyond. The princess, 45, and Sheikh Mohammed, 69, were married in 2004 and have a daughter, 11, and son, 7, together. Both were educated at elite English universities and they share a love for horses. Media reports indicate she took the children with her when she left Dubai. Under Islamic law, a woman can at least nominally retain custody of her children in a divorce. Nonetheless, decisions about schooling, travel and lifestyles of the children often remain with the father in the Middle East. Given the Dubai ruler's power, it is unlikely Princess Haya would have had a say in her children's ability to leave the UAE had she not reportedly fled with them. Haya's half-brother is Jordan's current monarch, King Abdullah, who was pictured at her side when she wed Dubai's ruler, reportedly becoming his sixth wife. She is a former Olympic athlete who competed in equestrian show jumping in the 2000 Sydney Games, a taboo-breaking feat for women from traditional Muslim countries. Her love of sports and horse riding began early - she was just 13 when she became the first female to represent Jordan internationally in equestrian show jumping. Haya has long stood out from other wives of Gulf Arab rulers not only because of her Jordanian royal background and Olympic ambitions, but because she was seen and photographed in public. Most rulers' wives in the Gulf are never photographed and their faces and names aren't known to the public. But Princess Haya wasn't only visible at humanitarian events, often seated front row in Dubai by her husband's side, but was a stylish fixture in glossy magazines and at prestigious equestrian events in the UK, like the Royal Ascot and Epsom Derby. In a 2009 Daily Mail interview, the princess said she deliberately postponed marriage until she could meet a man ""who doesn't feel he has to mold me."" She was quoted as saying, ""You have to accept that you're in control of yourself but not your destiny."" The government of Dubai hasn't commented on the media reports about Princess Haya fleeing with her children to Europe.

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced to Parliament that Alek Sigley, 29, had been released following intervention from Swedish diplomats and had been taken to the Australian Embassy in Beijing. Later Thursday, Sigley flew to Tokyo's Haneda airport to reunite with his Japanese wife. He walked past reporters there without making any comments. Earlier, at Beijing's airport, he gave a peace sign and said ""I'm OK, I'm OK, I'm good. I'm very good,'' but did not respond to reporters' questions about what had happened in Pyongyang. His father, Gary Sigley, a professor of Asian studies at the University of Western Australia, said his son had been treated well in North Korea. It was a much happier outcome than the case of American college student Otto Warmbier, who was imprisoned in North Korea and convicted of attempting to steal a propaganda poster. Warmbier died shortly after being sent back home to the US in a vegetative state in June 2017. Sigley's friend and fellow student of North Korea, University of Technology Sydney academic Bronwen Dalton, said she had spoken to Sigley's wife, who was thrilled by his release. ""We were jumping up and down and we love Sweden,'' Dalton said. ""He's a fine, young, emerging Asian scholar, he is very applied to his studies. I really doubted whether he did actually anything wrong by the regime,'' Dalton added. Swedish diplomats had raised concerns about Sigley with North Korean authorities in Pyongyang, where Australia does not have an embassy. ""Swedish authorities advised the Australian government that they met with senior officials from the DPRK yesterday and raised the issue of Alek's disappearance on Australia's behalf,'' Morrison said, using the official acronym for North Korea. ""This outcome demonstrates the value of discrete behind-the-scenes work of officials in resolving complex and sensitive consular cases in close partnership with other governments,'' Morrison said. In an interview with Swedish public radio, Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom said the country's special envoy to North Korea, Kent Harstedt, ``raised the issue of this case at highest level'' in North Korea and the release happened during his visit there. North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency said the Swedish delegation led by Harstedt headed back home on Thursday after a four-day visit. It said the Swedes visited a stamp museum and shoe factory during their stay in North Korea, but made no mention of Sigley. The Pyongyang university student and tour guide had been out of contact with family and friends in Japan and Australia since Tuesday last week. He had been active on social media about his experiences in North Korea and had boasted about the extraordinary freedom he had been allowed as one of the few foreign students living in Pyongyang. Morrison's announcement was the first confirmation that he had been detained. Morrison said he discussed Sigley's disappearance with other world leaders attending the Group of 20 summit in Japan last week and accepted offers to find out what happened to him. Morrison dined with President Donald Trump in Osaka but declined to say with whom he discussed Sigley's disappearance. North Korea has been accused in the past of detaining Westerners and using them as political pawns to gain concessions. Leonid Petrov, an Australian National University expert on North Korea and a friend of Sigley, last week speculated that Sigley had been ""deliberately cut off from means of communications'' temporarily because Trump was in the region. Petrov said on Thursday that he had not been able to contact Sigley since he had been freed, but still suspected his disappearance was linked to Trump's meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Sunday. ""It was a time of sensitivity in North Korea after the visit of (Chinese President) Xi Jinping and before the visit by Donald Trump,'' Petrov said. ""I expected this to happen a couple of days earlier, but it was a good thing to see the Swedish government delegation arrive on Monday just after the summit. It was the right time to be there,'' Petrov added.

Fed up with what they say is worsening air pollution, a group of 31 concerned residents has sued President Joko Widodo, as well as the ministry of environment and forestry, ministry of health, and Jakarta's governor. The plaintiffs — which include activists, office workers and motorcycle taxi drivers — want to raise awareness about the issue and force the government to act. ""(The government) has neglected people's rights to breathe healthy air,"" lawyer Nelson Nikodemus Simamora told reporters after filing the lawsuit. ""They have not maintained air quality at a level that is healthy enough for the 10 million people living here."" Toxic smog saw Jakarta ranked as the most polluted city in the world for several mornings running last month, forcing residents to wear pollution masks and sparking a storm of social media criticism. Air Visual, an independent online air quality index (AQI) monitor, pegged Jakarta at the ""very unhealthy"" level of 231 on June 25, higher than notoriously polluted cities like India's capital New Delhi and Beijing in China. Environment groups blame the air pollution on a cocktail of vehicle fumes, smoke and emissions from coal-fired power plants that ring greater Jakarta. Greenpeace Indonesia last week recommended people don masks to protect themselves from respiratory illness. ""The number of unhealthy days for 2018 is twice as high as the figure for 2017,"" Bondan Andriyanu, climate and energy campaigner for the group, told AFP. ""The government should recognise the issue, they are still using outdated regulation from the '90s."" Public discontent has been growing, especially online where social media users have been posting pictures of the city blanketed in a grey haze. ""As a mother of two I'm worried about the air pollution issue,"" 35-year-old office worker Dita Nadine told AFP. ""The government should address the cause of the problem... how long will we let this problem continue?"" The environment ministry did not immediately respond to AFP's requests for comment on the lawsuit, but the head of Jakarta's environment agency, Andono Warih, played down the problem. On Monday, he denied that Jakarta had the world's worst air pollution, the Jakarta Post reported, citing lower government figures established using a different methodology.

Despite the orders, just 3,000 people were in shelters in the Kagoshima region on Thursday morning, an official tally showed. The rains come a year after torrential downpours in western Japan that killed over 200 people in flooding and landslides. One woman has so far been killed in the rains that began at the weekend, after her house was buried in a landslide. Several injuries have been reported along with small landslides that have buried cars. More than one million people in Kagoshima remained under evacuation order on Thursday morning, with additional orders being issued along with lower-level evacuation advisories. Television footage showed cars swept away by floods and rivers breaking their banks in Kagoshima. At an evacuation centre in the region, elderly residents sat on the floor eating, with their bedding and other belongings spread out around them. The evacuation order is issued when a natural disaster is highly likely to occur and municipalities repeatedly urge residents to leave their homes, although the instruction is frequently ignored. It is the most serious warning issued before a disaster actually occurs. The scale's highest level is activated once a disaster is declared and orders people to take measures to protect their lives. The Japan Meteorological Agency has warned that life-threatening landslides are possible. Heavy rain was moving northwest Thursday and forecast to bring downpours to central and eastern Japan in coming days. Kagoshima Governor Satoshi Mitazono said in a message Wednesday to residents that the situation was ""extremely dangerous"". ""A major disaster could happen anywhere, any time,"" he said, adding that he had requested help from the military. Japanese authorities are urging people to take shelter early after disastrous heavy rains last summer in the west of the country that killed more than 200 people. Many of the deaths were blamed on the fact that evacuation orders were issued too late and some people failed to heed them. Entire neighbourhoods were buried beneath landslides or submerged in flood waters during the disasters.

Home affairs minister Peter Dutton introduced the legislation based on British law as part of a raft of counterterrorism and asylum seeker bills in the first parliamentary session since elections in May. The law would give Dutton the power to prevent suspected Australian extremists from returning home for up to two years while law enforcement authorities made plans to manage the risk posed. The orders could also apply to Australians who intelligence agencies assess to be a ""risk to security for reasons related to politically motivated violence."" Dutton said 230 Australians had flown to Syria and Iraq to fight with extremist groups since 2012. ""Around 80 are still active in conflict zones. The advice of Australia's national security agencies is that many Australians of counterterrorism concern who have traveled to Iraq and Syria to engage in that conflict are likely to seek to return to Australia in the very near future,"" Dutton told Parliament. ""This bill will ensure that law enforcement agencies can effectively manage these returns in a way that will reduce the threat to the Australian community,"" he added. The order could not be applied to an Australian under 14 years old. When considering making an order against children aged 15 to 17, Dutton must make the child's interests his primary consideration. The orders can be appealed to review boards, but the reasons might not be revealed if the disclosure of that information was not in the public interest, Dutton said. Dutton said the need for such orders was highlighted on Tuesday when 20-year-old Sydney man Isaak el Matari was arrested and charged with plotting a terrorist attack in Sydney and attempting to fly to Afghanistan to fight with the Islamic State group. Matari had returned to Australia in June last year from Lebanon, where he had spent time in prison for allegedly attempting to travel to Syria to fight. He underwent a deradicalization program on his return to Sydney and was under continuous police surveillance. Australia continues to beef up its counterterrorism laws as questions are being asked about whether they impose too many restrictions on human rights and free speech. Police were widely accused of attempting to intimidate the media when they raided Australian Broadcasting Corp.'s Sydney headquarters and a News Corp. reporter's Canberra home in June in search of leaked government documents. Australia's three largest media organizations — ABC, News Corp. and Nine Entertainment — joined forces last week to demand legal reforms that would exempt journalists from national security laws passed since 2012 that ""would put them in jail for doing their jobs."" They also want a right to contest warrants such as those executed in Sydney and Canberra. The organizations have called for greater legal protections for public sector whistleblowers as well as reforms to freedom of information and defamation laws. Executives of the three organizations plus Seven West Media, SBS and Free TV met at Parliament House on Wednesday with Attorney-General Christian Porter and Communications Minister Paul Fletcher to discuss reforms. ABC Managing Director David Anderson said in a statement on behalf of the organizations after the meeting that ""we remain frustrated that a month after search warrants were carried out by the Australian Federal Police the fate of our journalists remains unclear.""

Christie's auction house expects the 28.5-centimetre (11-inch) quartz relic to fetch more than £4 million ($5 million, 4.5 million euros) at one of its most controversial auctions in years. The famous pharaoh's finely-chiselled face -- its calm eyes and puffed lips emoting a sense of eternal peace -- comes from the private Resandro Collection of ancient art that Christie's last sold in 2016 for £3 million. But angry Egyptian officials want the sale halted and the treasure returned. Christie's decision ""contradicts international agreements and conventions,"" Egypt's foreign ministry said on Wednesday. Former antiquities minister Zahi Hawass told AFP that the piece appears to have been ""stolen"" in the 1970s from the Karnak Temple complex. ""We think it left Egypt after 1970 because in that time other artefacts were stolen from Karnak Temple,"" Hawass said. Christie's counters that Egypt had never before expressed the same level of concern about a bust whose existence has been ""well known and exhibited publicly"" for many years. ""The object is not, and has not been, the subject of an investigation,"" it said in a statement to AFP Wednesday. The auction house has published a chronology of how the relic changed hands between European art dealers over the past 50 years. Its oldest attribution from 1973-74 places it in the collection of Prince Wilhelm of Thurn and Taxi in modern-day Germany. Yet that account was called into doubt by a report from the Live Science news site last month suggesting that Wilhelm never owned the piece. Wilhelm was ""not a very art-interested person,"" his niece Daria told the news site. A journalist and art historian who knew Wilhelm told Live Science site that the prince had no arts collection at all. Tutankhamun is thought to have become a pharaoh at the age of nine and to have died about 10 years later. His rule would have probably passed without notice were it not for the 1922 discovery by Britain's Howard Carter of his nearly intact tomb. The lavish find revived interest in ancient Egypt and set the stage for subsequent battles over ownership of cultural masterpieces unearthed in colonial times. Tutankhamun became commonly known as King Tut and made into the subject of songs and films. International conventions and the British government's own guidance restrict the sale of works that were known to have been stolen or illegally dug up. The British Museum has been wrangling for decades with Greece over its remarkable room full of marble Parthenon friezes and sculptures. Egypt's own campaign to recover lost art gained momentum after numerous works went missing during the looting that accompanied former president Hosni Mubarak's fall from power in 2011. Cairo has managed to regain hundreds of looted and stolen artefacts by working with both auction houses and international cultural groups. But Egypt has been unable to substantiate its case with firm proof that the Tutankhamun bust was illegally obtained. Christie's told AFP that it would ""not sell any work where there isn't clear title of ownership"".

The multiyear payout is independent of lawsuits filed by families of the 346 people killed in the two crashes, which happened in October 2018 and March of this year, a Boeing spokesman said. The funds will not go directly to the families, but will be given to local governments and non-profit organisations to help families with education and living expenses and to spur economic development in affected communities. Boeing also said it will match any employee donations through December. “The families and loved ones of those on board have our deepest sympathies, and we hope this initial outreach can help bring them comfort,” said Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg. Dozens of lawsuits have been filed against Boeing by families of Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crash victims. The company is in settlement talks over the Lion Air litigation and has separately offered to negotiate with families of Ethiopian Airlines victims, although some families have said they are not ready to settle. Wednesday’s cash pledge comes as Boeing faces probes by global regulators and US lawmakers over the development of the 737 MAX. The company has been criticised for what some have seen as a clumsy response to the crashes. Muilenburg and other executives have said safety is Boeing’s priority and have vowed to learn from the crashes. The 737 MAX was grounded worldwide in March, after the second crash. Boeing is working on a fix for software that has been identified as a common link in both crashes, which must be approved by US air regulators before the 737 MAX can fly again.

The visit, ostensibly following an invitation from Trump, will follow Pakistan’s purported crackdown on terrorist groups, including the possible “arrest” of Hafiz Saeed, leader of the proscribed LeT. Saeed is typically taken into state custody or house arrest whenever things get hot for Islamabad in the global arena and is quietly released later once international scrutiny fades. Ahead of the scheduled visit, Pakistan is also professedly cracking down on terror financing to meet criteria set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) although the state itself and its instruments such as ISI has been a supporter of such terror groups. Pursuant to FATF’s latest warning to Pakistan following its meeting in Orlando last week that it could be blacklisted because of lack of action (it is currently on the gray list), Islamabad reluctantly moved against Hafiz Saeed even as it complained that India was part of a rigged jury that sat in judgment on Pakistan’s actions. “We feel that we have done a lot. We are also clear and determined to do more. But we would not want the jury to be rigged. And there are already predetermined positions. Be it the statements issued by the Indian minister for finance or by their other senior leaders, publicly calling for the blacklisting of Pakistan,” Pakistan’s envoy to the US Asad Majeed Khan said at a think tank event in Washington DC last week. “Ironically, India is also the co-chair of (FATF’s) Asia Pacific Group, So you put yourself in our position and ask us what would our confidence level be in terms of the fairness of that jury which is sitting in judgment on our performance,” he added. New Delhi has been and continues to be skeptical of Pakistan’s actions because leading terrorist figures such as Hafiz Saeed, Masood Azhar, Zaki-u Rehman Lakhvi, and Dawood Ibrahim among others continue to be protected by the state despite copious evidence pointing to their involvement in terrorist attacks on India. Any evidence, from fingerprints to voice samples to terrorist captured alive and confessing on film (as it happened during 26/11) is dismissed as insufficient by Islamabad’s terrorism backing leaders, even though sections of the Pakistani media itself has called their bluff. Islamabad’s latest actions of initiating 23 charges of terrorism financing and money laundering against Saeed were described as “cosmetic steps” by New Delhi given its long sufferance of Pakistan’s subterfuge. But a combination of gullibility and a tactical need for Pakistan in order to extricate itself from Afghanistan appears to have led Washington to accept the bonafides of the latest action, at least on surface, and invite Khan to meet Trump. This despite Trump publicly berating Pakistan over Twitter as a country that sucked up American money while doing nothing for the US and cutting off all bilateral aid to Pakistan. Pakistan too appears ready to temporarily sacrifice its terrorist proxies because of its parlous financial situation that has caused it to go with a begging bowl to friends and allies, with modest returns. The Pakistani rupee has plunged precipitously over the past year, hitting close to Rs 160 per dollar, and Islamabad appears to have realized it cannot survive for long without Uncle Sam's munificence. Amid alarm bells for the economy, even the Pakistani military, which has lived sumptuously off the economy, has agreed to tighten its belt, and on Wednesday the IMF approved - with Washington's tacit nod - a USD 6 billion loan over a period of three years after Islamabad met a series of stringent conditions. It is the 22nd bailout package since Pakistan became member of the IMF in 1950.

""The present investigation has revealed that Jabir Motiwala is a top lieutenant in D Company who reports directly to Dawood,"" he added.

Dawood, who heads a vast and multifaceted illegal business, has emerged as India's most wanted terrorist after the 1993 Mumbai bombings. According to the US, Dawood maintains close links with terror outfit al-Qaeda. As a result, the US declared him a ""global terrorist"" and pursued the matter before the United Nations in an attempt to freeze his assets across the world and crack down on his operations. Dawood's aide Moti faces extradition to the US on charges of money laundering, extortion and conspiracy to import unlawful substances such as heroine.

Board approval will allow immediate disbursement of around $1 billion, with the remainder to be phased in over the period of the programme, subject to quarterly review, the IMF said, highlighting the need for Pakistan to agree to tough conditions for the coming three years. Just as important as the package itself, approval will also unlock an additional $38 billion from Pakistan's international partners over the programme period. ""Pakistan is facing significant economic challenges on the back of large fiscal and financial needs and weak and unbalanced growth,"" IMF first deputy managing director David Lipton said in a statement. The programme will require ""decisive fiscal consolidation"" and a multi-year plan to strengthen Pakistan's notoriously weak tax system as well as large scale reforms that are likely to pile pressure on the government of Prime Minister Imran Khan. Khan came to power last August, inheriting an economy plagued with problems. But he was initially deeply reluctant to turn to the IMF, which has provided more than 20 bailout packages to Pakistan over the decades. However, despite securing billions of dollars in loans from friendly countries including China, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, mounting economic headwinds forced his government to turn to the fund. With foreign exchange reserves shrinking to only $7.3 billion, less than the equivalent of two months' worth of imports, and the budget deficit set to top 7% of gross domestic product this year, Pakistan faces tough economic medicine to tackle problems that have been years in the making. Dominated by agriculture and textiles and with a large informal sector that pays no tax, the economy has struggled to develop export industries and successive governments have spent heavily to defend an overvalued exchange rate. The $60 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor, launched in 2015, had promised a new beginning. Its infrastructure projects were intended to become a new foundation for growth, but they also required heavy imports of capital equipment, widening the trade deficit. According to IMF forecasts, real GDP growth is expected to slow to 2.4% in the current fiscal year to June 2020, down from 3.3% in the year just ended. The IMF's terms call for a ""flexible market-determined exchange rate"" to help correct an unsustainable current account deficit and make industries more competitive, while trying to expand the tax base in a country where only 1% of the 208 million population file returns. The central bank, which controls the currency, has hiked interest rates to 12.25% and slashed the rupee to historic lows against the dollar, but this has piled more pressure on households facing inflation running at almost 9%. In addition, in a bid to cut public debt, the government has set ambitious tax and revenue plans, despite failing to meet the previous year's targets and hiked prices in the creaking energy sector, where mounting debt backlogs have acted as a growing drain on government resources. The programme also calls for expanded social spending to protect the most vulnerable. However, the combined package of belt-tightening measures has prompted anger from opposition parties, which say the government hesitated too long before turning to the fund. They have pledged a campaign of protests this month.

The visit, ostensibly following an invitation from Trump, will follow Pakistan’s purported crackdown on terrorist groups, including the possible “arrest” of Hafiz Saeed, leader of the proscribed LeT. Saeed is typically taken into state custody or house arrest whenever things get hot for Islamabad in the global arena and is quietly released later once international scrutiny fades. Ahead of the scheduled visit, Pakistan is also professedly cracking down on terror financing to meet criteria set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) although the state itself and its instruments such as ISI has been a supporter of such terror groups. Pursuant to FATF’s latest warning to Pakistan following its meeting in Orlando last week that it could be blacklisted because of lack of action (it is currently on the gray list), Islamabad reluctantly moved against Hafiz Saeed even as it complained that India was part of a rigged jury that sat in judgment on Pakistan’s actions. “We feel that we have done a lot. We are also clear and determined to do more. But we would not want the jury to be rigged. And there are already predetermined positions. Be it the statements issued by the Indian minister for finance or by their other senior leaders, publicly calling for the blacklisting of Pakistan,” Pakistan’s envoy to the US Asad Majeed Khan said at a think tank event in Washington DC last week. “Ironically, India is also the co-chair of (FATF’s) Asia Pacific Group, So you put yourself in our position and ask us what would our confidence level be in terms of the fairness of that jury which is sitting in judgment on our performance,” he added. New Delhi has been and continues to be skeptical of Pakistan’s actions because leading terrorist figures such as Hafiz Saeed, Masood Azhar, Zaki-u Rehman Lakhvi, and Dawood Ibrahim among others continue to be protected by the state despite copious evidence pointing to their involvement in terrorist attacks on India. Any evidence, from fingerprints to voice samples to terrorist captured alive and confessing on film (as it happened during 26/11) is dismissed as insufficient by Islamabad’s terrorism backing leaders, even though sections of the Pakistani media itself has called their bluff. Islamabad’s latest actions of initiating 23 charges of terrorism financing and money laundering against Saeed were described as “cosmetic steps” by New Delhi given its long sufferance of Pakistan’s subterfuge. But a combination of gullibility and a tactical need for Pakistan in order to extricate itself from Afghanistan appears to have led Washington to accept the bonafides of the latest action, at least on surface, and invite Khan to meet Trump. This despite Trump publicly berating Pakistan over Twitter as a country that sucked up American money while doing nothing for the US and cutting off all bilateral aid to Pakistan. Pakistan too appears ready to temporarily sacrifice its terrorist proxies because of its parlous financial situation that has caused it to go with a begging bowl to friends and allies, with modest returns. The Pakistani rupee has plunged precipitously over the past year, hitting close to Rs 160 per dollar, and Islamabad appears to have realized it cannot survive for long without Uncle Sam's munificence. Amid alarm bells for the economy, even the Pakistani military, which has lived sumptuously off the economy, has agreed to tighten its belt, and on Wednesday the IMF approved - with Washington's tacit nod - a USD 6 billion loan over a period of three years after Islamabad met a series of stringent conditions. It is the 22nd bailout package since Pakistan became member of the IMF in 1950.

"70072797"|"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/california-becomes-1st-state-to-ban-hairstyle-discrimination/articleshow/70072797.cms"|"[PTI]"|"SACRAMENTO: Governor Gavin Newsom signed into law on Wednesday a bill making California the first state to ban workplace and school discrimination against black people for wearing hairstyles such as braids, twists and locks. The law by Democratic Sen Holly Mitchell of Los Angeles, a black woman who wears her hair in locks, makes California the first state to explicitly say that those hairstyles are associated with race and therefore protected against discrimination in the workplace and in schools. ""We are changing the course of history, hopefully, across this country by acknowledging that what has been defined as professional hair styles and attire in the work place has historically been based on a Euro-centric model — based on straight hair,"" Mitchell said. Stephanie Hunter-Ray, who works at a makeup counter, says she typically wears her hair braided or in an afro, but one day she showed up to work with it straightened and styled in a bob. Her manager told Hunter-Ray her hair had never looked so normal. ""It bothered me,"" Hunter-Ray said in an interview at the hair salon she owns in Sacramento that specializes in natural hair styles. ""What do you mean by 'normal?' Your normal is not my normal. My normal is my 'fro or my braids."" Alikah Hatchett-Fall, who runs Sacred Crowns Salon in Sacramento, said she's had black men come into her salon asking to have their hair cut off because they can't find jobs. The law, she said, ""means that psychologically and mentally people can be at ease and be able to get the jobs they want, keep the jobs they want, and get promoted at the jobs they want."" California's new law, which takes effect January 1, is significant because federal courts have historically held that hair is a characteristic that can be changed, meaning there's no basis for discrimination complaints based on hairstyle. The US Supreme Court recently declined to hear the case of an Alabama woman who said she didn't get a job because she refused to change her hair. The issue burst into public view last December, when a black high school wrestler in New Jersey was told by a referee that he had to cut off his dreadlocks if he wanted to compete. California's Democratic governor said the video was a clear example of the discrimination black Americans face. ""His decision whether or not to lose an athletic competition or lose his identity came into, I think, stark terms for millions of Americans,"" Newsom said before signing the bill alongside Mitchell and half a dozen advocates. ""That is played out in workplaces, it's played out in schools — not just athletic competitions and settings — every single day all across America in ways subtle and overt."" Though California is the first state with such a law, New York City earlier this year issued legal guidance banning discrimination against someone based on their hairstyle. The beauty company Dove is part of a coalition pushing for more hairstyle protections, and Mitchell said she hopes other states follow California. Mitchell's bill adds language to the state's discrimination laws to say that ""race"" also includes ""traits historically associated with race,"" including hair texture and protective hairstyles. It further defines protective hairstyles as braids, twists and locks. The term locks, or ""locs,"" is the preferred term to dreadlocks, which has a derogatory connotation. At Hunter-Ray's studio, Exquisite U, on Wednesday, her stylists and customers reflected on the new law. Shereen Africa, who was having her hair re-braided by Elicia Drayton, said she used to work at a television station in Mississippi where a black anchor quit after facing resistance to wearing her hair in locks. Africa said she did not wear her hair in braids at the job, even though she wasn't on air, because the environment wasn't supportive of it. ""If I'm in a professional setting, I won't wear my hair in certain ways,"" she said. An anchor at a different Mississippi TV station made national news when she said she was fired after she stopped straightening her hair. ""You want to go to work and feel free,"" Drayton said. ""You don't want to have to feel like you have to put on a wig or you have to have your hair straight to please someone else.""

US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un held an impromptu summit on North Korean soil on Sunday, where they smiled and shook hands, ending a standstill in discussions. But in a quick shift in tone, Pyongyang's delegation to the United Nations on Wednesday said the US continues to be ""obsessed with sanctions"". It complained that while Trump invited Kim to hold talks, the US had also sent a letter to all UN member-states urging them to send back North Korean workers. The delegation claimed the letter - also signed by Britain, France and Germany - was sent on June 29, the same day Trump tweeted that he would like to shake Kim's hand during his visit to the Korean peninsula. ""What can't be overlooked is the fact that this joint letter game was carried out by the permanent mission of the United States to the UN under the instruction of the State Department, on the very same day when President Trump proposed (for) the summit meeting,"" said the press statement from the North Korean mission. It shows that the US is ""more and more hell-bent on the hostile acts"" against North Korea, even while it is seeking dialogue, it added. The US letter was in fact sent on June 27 and called on all countries to apply sanctions provisions that call for the return of all North Korean workers by the end of 2019 The UN estimates tens of thousands of North Koreans are sent abroad every year, mostly to China and Russia, working in slave-like conditions to generate hard currency for Pyongyang. ""We do not thirst for lifting of sanctions,"" the North Korean mission said, adding it was ""quite ridiculous"" for the United States to consider the restrictions a ""panacea for all problems."" UN sanctions ban all new contracts with North Korean workers and commit countries with existing migrant labourers from there to sending them back by the end of this year. In the letter, the four countries noted that only 34 countries had filed reports to the UN on what action they have taken. Trump became the first US president to ever visit North Korea on Sunday, stepping in to the Demilitarized Zone following a last-minute invitation to his counterpart on Twitter. It marked a thaw in the pair's hot-and-cold relationship, after their last meeting in Hanoi ended without agreement. As well as the working-level talks, Trump also floated the idea of sanctions relief -- repeatedly demanded by Pyongyang — and said he invited the North Korean leader to the White House. Analysts have been divided by Sunday's events, some saying they spurred new momentum into deadlocked nuclear talks, while others described them as ""reality show theatrics"".

On Monday, the first day of the extradition trial of Jabir Motiwala — who is accused of being Dawood’s top henchman — at Westminster magistrates’ court, John Hardy QC, representing the US government, said: “The FBI in New York is investigating the D-Company which is based in Pakistan, India and the UAE.” “The head is Dawood Ibrahim, an Indian Muslim living in exile in Pakistan. He and his brother have been fugitives from India since 1993 and over the past 10 years, D-Company operatives have conducted operations in the US, specifically money laundering and extortion. The FBI investigation has revealed Motiwala reports directly to Dawood and extortion, debt collection and money laundering are his main jobs,” Hardy said. The US government is seeking to extradite Motiwala to the US to face charges of conspiracy to commit extortion, blackmail, A-class drugs trafficking and money laundering. He is contesting the extradition. “Motiwala is said to be a high-ranking member of D-Company which operates in the subcontinent and UAE and has international reach,” Hardy said. The court heard how at least three FBI confidential sources met Motiwala — who lives in Karachi but travels extensively — in the US in 2011 and visited him in Pakistan in 2011 and 2012. “Motiwala made it clear he was with D-Company,” Hardy said. On the trip in December 2011 to Pakistan, the FBI confidential source said: “The D-Company works in narcotics-trafficking that generates large amounts of cash.” “In December 2011 in Pakistan Motiwala introduced one of the FBI confidential sources to his co-conspirator who is the lead money launderer for D-Company. During the meetings in Pakistan in 2011, the confidential source and Motiwala discussed debt collection and extortion and how for a fee D-Company uses (its) power for violence to resolve business disputes. Motiwala discussed debt collections by the D-Company in the US and abroad,” Hardy said. The FBI informant returned to the US late 2011 and stayed in touch with Motiwala by phone and email.

"70047528"|"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/vijay-mallya-wins-right-to-appeal-extradition-on-grounds-there-is-no-prima-facie-case/articleshow/70047528.cms"|"[NAOMI CANTON, TNN]"|"LONDON: The London high court ruled on Tuesday that fugitive tycoon Vijay Mallya may appeal against his extradition to India on his argument that no prima facie case is made out against him. The ruling will be seen as a major blow to the Indian investigating authorities. The decision followed a four-hour hearing at which Clare Montgomery QC, extradition barrister for Mallya, argued that there had been a series of faults with the decision by chief magistrate Emma Arbuthnot in December 2018 to send his case to the home secretary and that Sajid Javid had failed in his duty to check that Mallya would not be dealt with for different offences other than the ones he was being extradited for once in India. The Indian government made written submissions to the court but did not have a barrister in court. Montgomery put forward five grounds upon which she wanted leave to appeal, the first of which was that there was no prima facie case to answer. Justice George Leggatt, who presided over the case with Justice Andrew Popplewell, granted Mallya permission on Tuesday to appeal on the prima facie grounds, but rejected the other grounds. The other grounds were that prison conditions in India were inhuman, that the charges against Mallya were politically motivated, that he would not receive a fair trial in India and that he might be dealt with in India for other offences, beyond the ones he was being extradited for. The court heard that Mallya was facing more than 40 criminal cases in India, in some of which warrants had been issued for his arrest. Extradition barrister Malcolm Hawkes, of Doughty Street Chambers, said: “The fact he has been granted permission to appeal on the prima facie case is quite interesting as that is the bedrock of the case. There is quite a low threshold the government of India has to reach to persuade the British court there is a case to answer in India, so this suggests to me that government of India evidence is either weak or inadmissible.” Now that Mallya has been granted leave to appeal, a full hearing is expected to be listed at the high court in about four to six months. If Mallya wins that, he will be discharged. If he loses, he could still try to appeal in the Supreme Court if he can persuade the court there is a point of law of general public importance in his case. A Supreme Court hearing would likely take at least one year after the high court hearing. If Mallya wins his appeal in the high court, it would be open to the Indian government to try to appeal that decision in the Supreme Court, again having to meet the test of identifying a point of law of general public importance. Walking out of court Mallya, who was beaming, said: “The senior judges have decided that the prima facie case of the chief magistrate is appealable and I always said these were false charges against me with fake evidence. I am glad I won on the prima facie case. That deals with the government’s charges against me and that means the most to me. Where is the question of fraud? As far as what Kingfisher owes to the banks, I have offered to pay it all back. Now the unthinkable has happened. Jet has collapsed. Who would have thought this would happen? That is the fragile state of aviation in India. The government needs to do something about that. It is unfair that if a business fails, the promoter is accused of fraud almost automatically these days. That is not right,” he said as he lit up a cigar. His son, Siddharth, and girlfriend Pinky, were by his side. In order to send Mallya’s extradition order to Javid, chief magistrate Emma Arbuthnot had to determine there was sufficient evidence available to make a case to answer in India. In her judgment she had said the Indian government had established a prima facie case. The Indian government wants to extradite Mallya, former chief executive of Kingfisher Airlines and chairman of UB Group, to India, to face charges of criminal conspiracy and cheating in relation to three loans made by IDBI Bank to Kingfisher Airlines in 2009. The Indian government claims Mallya, in connivance with Kingfisher executives and banking officials, obtained the loans fraudulently by making misrepresentations about the profitability of the airline, and the value of and availability of securities, intending to make gains for himself and expose the bank to losses, and that Mallya then proceeded to launder the money. Reading out the judgment on granting leave to appeal, Justice Leggatt said: “We have decided that the appellant’s first grounds of appeal is at least reasonably arguable. The district judge found a prima facie case of fraud and misrepresentation but it is argued that many of these alleged misrepresentations she has found in her judgment are not the same ones alleged in the extradition request nor have they even been alleged by the government of India at the extradition hearing so they are not part of the case.

The Taliban detonated a powerful car bomb in an area of Afghanistan's capital housing military and government buildings, killing at least 16 people. The bomb went off during the morning rush hour in Kabul when the streets were filled with people, injuring 105 people, including 51 children and five women. The explosives also damaged schools and other infrastructure in the immediate vicinity. ""The Secretary-General is outraged and deeply saddened by the Taliban-claimed complex attack that took place on 1 July in a civilian-populated area of Kabul,"" a statement issued by the secretary general's spokesman said. Guterres ""reiterates that international humanitarian law explicitly prohibits indiscriminate attacks and attacks directed against civilians, and appeals to all parties to the conflict in Afghanistan to uphold their obligations to protect civilians"". The UN Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict, Virginia Gamba, also condemned the horrific attack. Several schools have reportedly been damaged by the explosions. ""I am appalled by this attack in which boys and girls have been killed and maimed, a result of blatant disregard for basic rules of war such as the protection of children and safe heavens in the conduct of hostilities. Children should be entitled to safety at all time, especially when at school or at home,"" she said. She expressed grave concerns at the continuous violence perpetrated by the Taliban and other parties to conflict in Afghanistan and called for immediate measures to be taken to ensure the safety and protection of children, the most vulnerable in times of war. Gambia called on the Afghan authorities to swiftly prosecute the perpetrators of this attack under national and international laws. Describing the attack as ""horrific"", Henrietta Fore, Executive Director of the UN Children's Fund, UNICEF, said, ""The deadly blast...did not spare children during one of their most mundane and important routines - being at school."" Fore said schools should be havens of peace, and the violence in or around them is never acceptable. The security situation in Afghanistan, which was ""already dire"", has recently deteriorated, and the ""violence, which keeps blighting futures and claiming young lives, must end"", she said. Generations of Afghan children, Fore said, have known nothing but war. ""It is more than time that they enjoyed a life free of violence and conflict."" The UN Mission in Afghanistan, UNAMA, tweeted that the UN was ""appalled"" by the bomb attack, and ""demands an end to indiscriminate blasts in civilian areas"".

The industry, which before the April attacks had expected a record number of foreign holiday makers in 2019 on the back of rave reviews in international travel magazines, saw arrivals plummet in May. The number of tourists dived to just 37,800 in May, down from 166,975 in the previous month, and 129,500 a year earlier, Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority figures showed. But the figures also showed an uptick since, with some 63,000 visitors arriving in June, a 66- per cent increase compared to May, but still way below the June 2018 figure of 146,828. Finance minister Mangala Samaraweera said last week that the damage to tourism from the April 21 attacks was less than intially feared. Even in the aftermath of the attacks, domestic tourists filled hotels which were able to retain staff and remain in business. Samaraweera had initially predicted that Sri Lanka could lose 30 percent of its tourism revenues, or about USD 1.5 billion, this year. But now he believes the loss will be less than USD 1 billion. The total number of holiday makers hit a record 2.33 million in 2018, up 10.3 percent compared to 2017. This year was expected to be another record high with arrivals jumping five percent in the first quarter before the Easter attacks devastated three churches and three luxury hotels. Sri Lanka topped the Best in Travel 2019 rankings of Lonely Planet, and this week the travel guide said the country remained its top pick. Many countries have softened their travel warnings on Sri Lanka which is, however, under a state of emergency since the attacks that also left nearly 500 people wounded.

The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty that limited medium-range missiles was concluded by Russia and the United States in 1987. Moscow suspended participation in the INF treaty in March after US President Donald Trump's White House announced it would ditch the agreement for alleged Russian violations of the terms. On Wednesday, Putin formalised the suspension by signing the bill which says the decision to resume the agreement is to be made by the Russian president. The INF deal resolved a crisis over Soviet nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles targeting Western capitals, but put no restrictions on other major military actors such as China. Together with another key arms control agreement known as New START, the INF was considered a cornerstone of global security. The agreement, which caps the number of nuclear warheads held by Washington and Moscow, expires in 2021. Putin has said he is ready to drop New START too, accusing Washington of being unwilling to negotiate an extension to the agreement.

Iran’s announcement on Monday that it had amassed more low-enriched uranium than permitted under the deal was confirmed by UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which monitors Iran’s nuclear programme under the deal.

Most of the funding (61%) is earmarked for early to mid-career scientists and scholars. Since 2007, the ERC has had a considerable impact on the European and associated countries' research landscape. In the last almost 10 years, it has funded close to 60 Indian researchers. The ERC grants are open to researchers of any nationality, including Indians, who intend to conduct their research activity in Europe. The eligibility for availing of the blue-sky research funding is PhD with some years of research. Researchers will have to submit their proposals to a scientific panel operating under the ERC. Based on the merit of his or her proposal, a researcher will be selected for the funding programme. While other EU research fundings are meant for researchers working in groups, the blue-sky research allows individual researchers to avail of grants. Blue-sky research is a scientific research in domains where ""real-world"" applications are not immediately apparent. It has been defined as ""research without a clear goal"" and ""curiosity-driven science"". Proponents of this mode of science argue that unanticipated scientific breakthroughs are sometimes more valuable than the outcomes of agenda-driven research. ERC president professor Jean-Pierre Bourguignon said: ""I am pleased that the ERC 2020 work programme will allow for funding researches of over a thousand excellent scientists who believe that Europe is the best place to follow their scientific curiosity. However, our continent hosts much more top talent with a wealth of creative ideas to bring to life. If Europe is serious about being a real powerhouse for science and innovation, major investment in R&I is needed, notably in blue-sky research via the ERC."" Every year, ERC selects and funds the very best, creative researchers of any nationality and age, to run projects based in Europe. It offers four core grant schemes: starting, consolidator, advanced and synergy grants. Besides adjustments to recently re-introduced synergy grant, the ERC scientific council decided to align ceilings of amounts that applicants can request to cover extraordinary costs exceeding normal grant ceilings of starting, consolidator and advanced grants. Previously, advanced grant applicants could request up to 1 million euro in additional funding, while starting and consolidator grant applicants could request up to 500 000 euro and 750 000 euro, respectively. The ceiling is now 1 million euro for all of three grants, while it remains 4 million euro for synergy grant. The decision aims to better reflect actual costs of doing research across scientific disciplines especially when it comes to major experimental and field work costs. To date, the ERC has funded over 9,000 top researchers at various stages of their careers, and over 50,000 postdocs, PhD students and other staff working in their research teams.

At a workshop in Bahrain last week, Kushner unveiled a $50 billion economic plan for the Palestinian territories, Jordan, Egypt and Lebanon. On Wednesday, he said he would have more to say about the way forward on the economic plan ""probably next week."" Sometime later this year, he is to outline a 50- to 60-page page plan that will offer proposals on resolving the thorny political issues between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Palestinians have harshly criticized the economic plan. In a conference call with reporters, Kushner said US President Donald Trump is ""very fond"" of Abbas and willing to engage with him at the right time. ""Our door is always open to the Palestinian leadership,"" Kushner said. He said he believes Abbas wants peace but ""certain people around him are very uncomfortable with the way we’ve approached this, and their natural reaction is to attack and say crazy things"" that are not constructive. But Kushner's comments on Palestinian refugees are likely to raise concerns among Palestinians. Whether the hundreds of thousands of refugees from the 1948 war of Israel's founding, which with their descendants now number around 5 million, will exercise a right of return has been among the thorniest issues in decades of difficult diplomacy. Israel has long ruled out any such influx as destabilizing, arguing that refugees should stay where they are or in a future Palestinian state. But prospects of such a state arising in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip are themselves in doubt. Asked by a Lebanese reporter whether the United States hoped Arab countries hosting Palestinian refugees would accept them permanently in exchange for funding, Kushner declined to answer directly, saying the matter would be addressed later. But he suggested a comparison between Jews displaced from Middle Eastern countries in 1948, many of whom Israel took in. ""Look, you have a situation when this whole thing started where you had 800,000 Jewish refugees that came out of all the different Middle Eastern countries and you had 800,000, roughly, Palestinian refugees,"" he said . ""And what's happened to the Israeli - to the Jewish - refugees, is they have been absorbed by different places whereas the Arab world has not absorbed a lot of these refugees over time,"" he said. ""I think that the people of Lebanon would love to see a resolution to this issue, one that is fair,"" he said. ""And I also think that the refugees, the Palestinian refugees who are in Lebanon, who are denied a lot of rights and who, you know, don't have the best conditions right now would also like to see a situation where there is a pathway for them to have more rights and to live a better life."" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long suggested a demographic tradeoff between Jewish and Palestinian refugees. Nikki Haley, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said during a Jerusalem visit last week that Washington has its own figure for Palestinian refugees. ""The number of actual Palestinian refugees is classified,” she told a conference hosted by the conservative Israel Hayom newspaper. “There are multiple people working to get it unclassified.""

The journey is not only a testament to the fox's stamina but also highlights the important role ice sheets serve for the migration of Arctic wildlife and the threat global warming poses to the ecological balance. Arnaud Tarroux, one of the researchers behind the study recording the fox's trek published by the Norwegian Polar Institute, warned that ""less ice... will mean less opportunities for this type of migration"". The arctic fox was equipped with a satellite tracker in July 2017 and set off from the island of Spitsbergen in the Norwegian Svalbard archipelago, about 1,000 kilometres from the North Pole, on March 26 2018. On July 1, 76 days after leaving Norway, the fox reached Ellesmere Island, one of Canada's northernmost communities, completing a journey of 3,506 kilometres. ""This species is even more enduring and faster than what has been observed in the past,"" Arnaud Tarroux told AFP Wednesday. ""It's a young female, less than a year old, therefore relatively inexperienced, literally going out to discover the world and surviving an Arctic crossing on her first attempt,"" he continued. Adding to the impressive feat is that the young vixen covered the first 1,512 kilometres to reach Greenland in just 21 days. ""This is the first observation that shows in detail that an arctic fox has migrated between different continents and ecosystems in the Arctic, and one of the longest migrations ever recorded for an arctic fox in such a short period of time,"" the Norwegian Polar Institute noted in a statement. The fox withstood the arid polar environments and moved at an average daily rate of 46.3 kilometres, with a daily record of 155 recorded while crossing Greenland. Why the fox opted to leave for Canada is unclear. ""It is quite possible that it is simply a series of coincidences that led her to find herself in an area of the Canadian arctic at the right time to find enough resources to be able to settle there,"" Tarroux said. The fox's current whereabouts are unknown since the tracking system stopped working in February 2019.

The airstrike raises further concerns about the European Union's policy of partnering with Libyan militias to prevent migrants from crossing the Mediterranean, which often leaves them at the mercy of brutal traffickers or stranded in squalid detention centers near the front lines. It could also lead to greater Western pressure on Khalifa Hifter, a Libyan general whose forces launched an offensive on Tripoli in April. The Tripoli-based government blamed his self-styled Libyan National Army for the airstrike and called for the UN to investigate. A spokesman for Hifter's forces did not immediately answer phone calls and messages seeking comment. Local media reported the LNA had launched airstrikes against a militia camp near the detention center in Tripoli's Tajoura neighborhood. Footage circulating online and said to be from inside the migrant detention center showed blood and body parts mixed with rubble and migrants' belongings. The airstrike hit a workshop housing weapons and vehicles and an adjacent hangar where around 150 migrants were being held, mostly Sudanese and Moroccans, according to two migrants who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. The migrants said three or four survived unharmed and about 20 were wounded. They said the rest were killed, indicating the final death toll could be much higher. Doctors Without Borders said the detention cell that was destroyed held 126 migrants. The aid group's Libya medical coordinator, Prince Alfani, said teams visited the center just hours before the airstrike. He said survivors fear for their lives, and he called for the immediate evacuation of the detention centers. The UN refugee agency also condemned the airstrike and called for an immediate end to efforts to return migrants to Libya. UNHCR spokesman Charlie Yaxley noted that the agency had warned less than two months ago that anyone inside the Tajoura detention center was at risk of being caught in the fighting around Tripoli. Then, an airstrike that hit nearby wounded two migrants. Yaxley said UNHCR is sending medical teams to the site after the latest airstrike. The head of the African Union, Moussa Faki Mahamat, also condemned the strike. He called for an independent investigation and said those responsible for the ``horrific crime'' should be held to account. The LNA launched an offensive against the weak Tripoli-based government in April. Hifter's forces control much of Libya's east and south but suffered a significant blow last week when militias allied with the Tripoli government reclaimed the strategic town of Gharyan, about 100 kilometers (62 miles) from the capital. Gharyan had been a key LNA supply route. Hifter's forces have targeted militia positions in Tajoura with airstrikes in recent weeks. The LNA said Monday it had begun an air campaign on rival forces in Tripoli after it lost control of Gharyan. Hifter's forces boast MiG fighter jets supplied by neighboring Egypt, as well as drones, attack helicopters and mine-resistant vehicles. It was not immediately clear what munitions were used in the airstrike early Wednesday. Oded Berkowitz, a security analyst focused on the Libyan conflict, said Hifter's LNA flies ``a handful of obsolete aircraft'' that are ``in poor condition.'' He said it has received spare parts from Egypt and possibly Russia, as well as decommissioned aircraft from both countries. ``Egypt and the UAE have been conducting air operations on behalf of the LNA, but there are no indications that the UAE transferred aircraft to the LNA,'' he said. Fathi Bashagha, the interior minister in the Tripoli-based government, claimed that foreign countries allied with Hifter were behind the attack. He told The Associated Press that Hifter's foreign backers ``went mad'' after his forces lost Gharyan. He did not name any countries or provide evidence to support his claim. He also denied any weapons were being stored at the detention facility. The fighting for Tripoli has threatened to plunge Libya into another bout of violence on the scale of the 2011 conflict that ousted longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi and led to his death. Hifter says he is determined to restore stability to the North African country. He is backed by Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia while his rivals, mainly Islamists, are supported by Turkey and Qatar. His campaign against Islamic militants across Libya since 2014 won him growing international support from world leaders who are concerned that Libya has become a haven for armed groups and a major conduit for migrants bound for Europe. His opponents, however, view him as an aspiring autocrat and fear a return to one-man rule. Libya became a major crossing point for migrants to Europe after Gadhafi's overthrow, when the North African nation was thrown into chaos, armed militias proliferated and central authority fell apart. At least 6,000 migrants from Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, Sudan and other nations are locked in dozens of detention facilities in Libya run by militias accused of torture and other abuses. Most of the migrants were apprehended by European Union-funded and -trained Libyan coast guards while trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea to Europe. The detention centers have limited food and other supplies for the migrants, who often end up there after arduous journeys at the mercy of abusive traffickers who hold them for ransom money from families back home. The UN refugee agency has said that more than 3,000 migrants are in danger because they are held in detention centers close to the front lines.

Myanmar Now editor Swe Win had been on trial for two years after posting an article on Facebook criticising the preacher abbot Wirathu. The monk is notorious for spewing Islamophobic vitriol, in particular against the Rohingya minority, and is now himself on-the-run from the law. His supporters in 2017 pressed charges against the journalist under the country's telecommunications law, often used against reporters and activists. But the court dismissed the case Tuesday, Swe Win's lawyer Ywut Nu Aung told AFP. ""All charges were completely dropped,"" she said, explaining that four prosecution witnesses had contravened court orders to turn up more than 20 times. The article posted by Swe Win quoted an abbot calling for Wirathu to be expelled from monkhood for publicly praising the killers of a respected Muslim lawyer. Ko Ni, a close confidant of civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, was shot dead in January 2017 while cradling his grandson. Swe Win told AFP Wednesday he was relieved his ordeal was over but said the court should never have accepted the case. ""Criticising someone for praising a murder is not a crime,"" he said. Describing the emotional and financial burden on him and his family, Swe Win said he made the 16-hour return trip from Yangon to the Mandalay court 71 times in two years. Wirathu's supporters have vowed to continue the legal fight against the reporter. The abbot himself is currently facing charges for sedition but remains at large. He recently gave several provocative speeches at nationalist rallies, making obscene remarks about Suu Kyi and urging people to worship soldiers like ""Buddha"". Facebook blacklisted him last year for his incendiary posts against the Rohingya. Rights groups say the posts helped whip up animosity, laying foundations for a military crackdown in 2017 that forced some 740,000 to flee to Bangladesh. The dismissal of the case against Swe Win was likely because of the government's ""new, highly negative view"" of Wirathu rather than any commitment to freedom of expression, Phil Robertson from Human Rights Watch said. Myanmar is currently ranked 138th in the world for press freedom with the number of defamation cases dramatically rising since Suu Kyi's government came to power in 2016.

A spokesperson of Pakistan’s Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) said cases have been registered against them in Lahore, Gujranwala and Multan for collecting funds for terrorism through assets/properties held as trusts and non-profit organizations (NPOs). “On July 1 and 2, Punjab CTD registered 23 cases against the leadership of Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD), Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Falah-e-Insaniyat Foundation (FIF) for making assets from terrorism financing through trusts/NPOs, including Dawat-ul-Irshad Trust, Muaz-Bin-Jabal Trust, Al-Anfaal Trust, Al-Hamd Trust and Al-Madina Foundation Trust,” the spokesperson said in a statement. Large scale investigations into the assets and properties owned by JuD, LeT and FIF, according to CTD, revealed that they had made these assets from funds of terrorism financing and later used these assets to raise more funds for further terrorism financing. “Hence, they committed multiple offences of terrorism financing and money laundering under the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997. They will be prosecuted in anti-terrorism courts for the commission of these offences. These assets/NPOs have already been taken over by the government in compliance with the UN’s sanctions,” the CTD spokesperson said. The JuD and LeT leaders who have been booked, include Hafiz Saeed, Abdul Rehman Makki, Malik Zafar Iqbal, Ameer Hamza, Muhammad Yahya Aziz, Muhammad Naeem, Mohsin Bilal, Abdul Raqeeb, Dr Ahmad Daud, Dr Muhammad Ayub, Abdullah Ubaid, Muhammad Ali, Abdul Ghaffar and others. The cases came as a consequence of the most recent crackdown against terror outfits. The crackdown itself happened after the unusually tough language used by FATF against Pakistan at the recent Orlando plenary. The global body asked Pakistan to implement all 27 points of its action plan by October, failing which it would take further action, even blacklisting Pakistan. The FATF had flagged four key areas where Pakistan had taken no action. Pakistan was criticised for not starting terror financing investigations against UN-designated terrorist leaders. The current action is being seen in that light. FATF also asked Pakistan to immediately freeze weapons stores, ammunition dumps etc; implement sanctions against UN listed terror entities and not give exemptions to terrorist leaders. Earlier this year, Pakistan had banned the JuD and its welfare wing, FIF, the two organisations headed by Saeed. Since then, the government has clamped down on JuD’s facilities and sealed its seminaries, besides taking administrative control of its pharmacies, health units, schools and ambulances across the country.

Pakistan Hindu Welfare Seva Trust president, Sanjesh Dhanja on Tuesday informed TOI that the girl, identified as Payal, was allegedly abducted when she left home for her tuition class. In March this year, the abduction of two Hindu teenage girls had led to a war of tweets between the then external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj and Pakistan’s then federal minister for information and broadcasting Chaudhary Fawad Hussain. Sindh chief minister’s special assistant Veerji Kolhi, a bonded labourer who is now a human rights activist, too uploaded the news about Payal’s abduction on his Facebook page late on Tuesday evening. “A 18-year-and-7-month-old student Payal Kumari was allegedly abducted by her teacher Kamran Soomor from Thatta. She went for tuition on June 29 at 8am but didn’t return home by 2.30pm. Then her parents came to know that her teacher, Kamran Soomro was also missing,” he wrote on Facebook. According to Veerji’s post, the police have registered an FIR and have also arrested the brothers of the alleged kidnapper — Imran, Amjad and Ayoob. Kolhi was appointed special assistant to the Sindh chief minister along with four others. He is brother of Pakistan People’s Party Senator Krishna Kumari Kolhi. The minority Hindu community in Pakistan has been troubled by the increase in the incidents of abduction and forced conversion of Hindu girls to Islam. In February and March this year, the Pakistan’s Hindu leadership had highlighted the issue of the kidnapping of two sisters, Raveena and Reena, who allegedly were kidnapped and forcibly converted to Islam and then married to men in their forties in Dhaka town of Sindh’s Gotki district.

At a workshop in Bahrain last week, Kushner unveiled a $50 billion economic plan for the Palestinian territories, Jordan, Egypt and Lebanon. On Wednesday, he said he would have more to say about the way forward on the economic plan ""probably next week."" Sometime later this year, he is to outline a 50- to 60-page page plan that will offer proposals on resolving the thorny political issues between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Palestinians have harshly criticized the economic plan. In a conference call with reporters, Kushner said US President Donald Trump is ""very fond"" of Abbas and willing to engage with him at the right time. ""Our door is always open to the Palestinian leadership,"" Kushner said. He said he believes Abbas wants peace but ""certain people around him are very uncomfortable with the way we’ve approached this, and their natural reaction is to attack and say crazy things"" that are not constructive. But Kushner's comments on Palestinian refugees are likely to raise concerns among Palestinians. Whether the hundreds of thousands of refugees from the 1948 war of Israel's founding, which with their descendants now number around 5 million, will exercise a right of return has been among the thorniest issues in decades of difficult diplomacy. Israel has long ruled out any such influx as destabilizing, arguing that refugees should stay where they are or in a future Palestinian state. But prospects of such a state arising in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip are themselves in doubt. Asked by a Lebanese reporter whether the United States hoped Arab countries hosting Palestinian refugees would accept them permanently in exchange for funding, Kushner declined to answer directly, saying the matter would be addressed later. But he suggested a comparison between Jews displaced from Middle Eastern countries in 1948, many of whom Israel took in. ""Look, you have a situation when this whole thing started where you had 800,000 Jewish refugees that came out of all the different Middle Eastern countries and you had 800,000, roughly, Palestinian refugees,"" he said . ""And what's happened to the Israeli - to the Jewish - refugees, is they have been absorbed by different places whereas the Arab world has not absorbed a lot of these refugees over time,"" he said. ""I think that the people of Lebanon would love to see a resolution to this issue, one that is fair,"" he said. ""And I also think that the refugees, the Palestinian refugees who are in Lebanon, who are denied a lot of rights and who, you know, don't have the best conditions right now would also like to see a situation where there is a pathway for them to have more rights and to live a better life."" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long suggested a demographic tradeoff between Jewish and Palestinian refugees. Nikki Haley, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said during a Jerusalem visit last week that Washington has its own figure for Palestinian refugees. ""The number of actual Palestinian refugees is classified,” she told a conference hosted by the conservative Israel Hayom newspaper. “There are multiple people working to get it unclassified.""

The couple was also accused of plotting the murder of their adopted son Gopal Sejani’s brother-in-law. However, the court turned down the request for extradition because life sentences for multiple murders do not get reviewed in Gujarat, where the victims were murdered. India had requested the extradition of Nairobi-born PIO Arti Dhir, 54, and her Indian husband Kaval Mahendrasinh Raijada, 30, who reside in London, in order to stand trial in Gujarat in relation to six allegations of conspiracy to commit murder, murder, attempt to commit murder, kidnapping, abduction for the purpose of committing murder and abetting a crime. Handing down the judgment, chief magistrate Emma Arbuthnot said: “I find there is a circumstantial prima facie case that Ms Dhir and Mr Raijada acting together and with others committed the offences set out above.” But she discharged the couple saying extradition would be incompatible with Article 3 of the European Convention of Human Rights. This is because there is no possibility of a review either at state level or by the President of India of a life sentence the couple would likely receive if convicted for double murder, she said. While Dhir’s family hails from Gurdaspur in Punjab, Raijada’s hails from Keshod in Gujarat. Both are alleged to have conspired with five others to murder Gopal in Gujarat and then split the proceeds from a claim on the insurance policy Dhir took out for Gopal worth Rs1.3 crore. The couple, who have been out on conditional bail, adopted Gopal in India in 2015 when he was 11 because Dhir could not have children. Gopal never moved to London. Instead, Gopal was kidnapped and stabbed by two hitmen on a motorbike on February 8, 2017, in Keshod. He died on February 11, 2017. His brother-in-law Harsukhbhai Kardani was also stabbed and died on February 17, 2017. The defendants are said to have arranged for the child to be killed with a number of others, including Raijada’s father and one Mr Mund in India. The motive is said to be financial as a wealth builder policy which was in essence a life insurance policy was set up for Gopal in 2015. In the event of Gopal’s death, it would pay 10 times the value of the annual premium of Rs1.3 crore. Dhir was the proposer and would benefit. The magistrate said “there was strong evidence of money being sent from the defendants’ London bank account to the man who organised the killing. Relevant emails were exchanged between the UK and India. This evidence means it is not impossible for a prosecution to be initiated here"".

The different areas of the 2,500 square metres exhibit are all inspired by their real counterparts in the Gir forest and nearby villages. For instance, the vibrant high street in the exhibit is modelled on the bustling village of Sasan Gir and the Maldhari community that lives so closely alongside the lions. The Land of Lions was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 2016. Since then, more than £3.6m have been garnered from scores of visitors. Land of the Lions shows how the people of Gujarat are striving to conserve the rare cat and how ZSL is working with government institutions in India to protect this incredible species, including providing training on patrol monitoring and veterinary care. The success story of Asiatic lions in Gir has become a model of conservation, with constant patrols against poachers. The protected area of Asiatic lions is spread over 1,452 sq km and includes five regions, including the Gir National Park, the Gir sanctuary, Matiyana and Paniya. About half of the population is outside the protected areas, closer to human settlements. “Protected by law, the lions play an important role in the local community who deeply value the presence of the big cats. But due to their limited range, this population of approximately 600 are at threat from disease outbreak and conflict with humans in villages less comfortable with their presence,” according to Edwards. ZSL London Zoo’s designers visited the lions’ wild home in Gujarat for inspiration and ideas and worked with members of the community there, and with London’s Gujarati community, to ensure the exhibit could be true to the India they know. “Railway tracks cross the lion paddock, exactly as the train tracks cut through the Gir forest and the trains are often halted by lions ahead!” “Every corner of our exhibit was inspired by the real Land of the Lions: The Gir Forest National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary. Even the sounds heard around Land of the Lions are true to life. During our visit to India we recorded soundscapes of street and forest life in Gujarat to ground Land of the Lions in reality,” she says. Rickshaws, bicycles, sacks of spices, maps, rangers’ huts, and even a life-size truck – including lots of items sourced and shipped from India – help to create a vibrant and exciting space, both inside and out of the lions’ domain, highlighting the unique proximity in which Asiatic lions live alongside people in their native Indian habitat. Providing cover to the pride There are more than 442 shrubs, 47 trees, and 46 species of plants — all of which provide cover to the pride to practise their hunting skills — deep shade for sunny days and full sunlight for basking. There are multiple high vantage points, which the big cats like to lie on to survey their territory, spread over two different paddocks, alongside a range of indoor and outdoor dens for the pride.

Compared to weather stretching back more than a century, the three-day temperature peak from June 26-28 in France was four degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than an equally rare June heatwave would have been in 1900, the World Weather Attribution team told journalists in a briefing. Global readings, meanwhile, taken by the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) showed European temperatures were around 2C hotter than normal, and globally Earth was 0.1C hotter than the previous June record. The heatwave last week smashed national records for the hottest single day as scorching weather spread across Europe from the Sahara. It was so intense that temperatures were as much as 10C higher than normal across France, Germany, northern Spain and Italy, C3S said. Global warming probably amplified France's devastating hot spell by far more than five times, said Friederike Otto, acting director of the Environmental Change Institute at the University of Oxford. ""Models are very good at representing large-scale seasonal changes in temperatures,"" she explained. ""On localised scales, climate models tend to underestimate the increase in temperature."" The findings, presented as a report and to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, focused on metropolitan France and the southern city of Toulouse, where climate statisticians were coincidentally meeting during the heatwave. Based purely on temperature records, extreme scorchers like the one last week are now 100 times more likely than in 1900, said Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, a senior researcher at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute and co-author of the new report. ""But we are unable to say that this is just because of climate change,"" he said. Air pollution, the ""urban heat island"" effect, soil moisture, cloud cover and a host of other factors can also affect the intensity of heatwaves. And models designed to work on a different scale are consistently ""biased"" such that they underestimate temperature peaks. ""Given what we know about the observation data and the biases of the models, this is our most conservative estimate as to the contribution of climate change,"" Otto told AFP. ""The likely role is much higher."" Merging satellite data with historic temperature charts, the Copernicus team found June 2019 was 3C hotter across Europe than the baseline average between 1850-1900. ""Our data show that the temperatures over the southwestern region of Europe during the last week of June were unusually high,"" said Jean-Noel Thepaut, head of C3S. ""Although this was exceptional, we are likely to see more of these events in the future due to climate change."" Curiously, France's heatwaves tend to spike higher than previous records compared to countries to its north and south, the World Weather Attribution findings showed. France, Italy, Spain and some central European nations all posted all-time temperatures peaks, with dozens of deaths attributed to the week-long heatwave. The final death toll is likely to be far higher, but will only show up months from now in statistical records as ""excess deaths"". A 2003 heatwave in France claimed at least 15,000 lives, according to government figures.

The 751-seat parliament — based in Strasbourg, France — is more fragmented than ever after a vote in May that saw solid gains by the liberals and Greens as well as the far right and eurosceptics in the 751-seat chamber. With Brexit delayed until as late as October 31, the deep political divisions in Britain were on full display in the eastern French city as 73 British MEPs arrived to parliament. Brexit firebrand Nigel Farage, a veteran of EU chamber since 1999, led the charge warning of a ""turquoise takeover"" in the UK if the ruling conservatives failed to deliver a divorce. With 29 elected representatives, his Brexit Party — whose official colour is turquoise — is the national party with the largest delegation, just ahead of the Northern League of Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini with 28 seats. Opposite Farage were the anti-Brexit Liberal Democrats, who also performed well in the EU elections and arrived in Strasbourg with bright yellow t-shirts emblazoned with ""Bollocks to Brexit"" and ""Stop Brexit"". In theory, the new parliament should have only 705 seats if Brexit were taken into account. When Brexit happens, 27 of the British seats are to be redistributed to other countries and another 46 set aside for future EU enlargements. The opening session was also marked by a protest by Catalan separatists outside the parliament in support of three of their own who are blocked by Madrid from taking office. As MEP delegations arrived to the chamber, at least 4,000 demonstrators waved the Catalan flag in front of the European Parliament. These include Carles Puigdemont, the former head of the Catalan regional government who lives in Belgium to escape a Spanish arrest warrant after leading an attempted secession in 2017. The others are his running mate Toni Comin, and the pro-independence activist Oriol Junqueras, who is in pre-trial detention in Spain. Their seats will remain empty in a situation that ""depends on the Spanish authorities, not the European Parliament,"" a parliament spokeswoman told AFP. Despite a Eurosceptic push, the pro-European bloc will keep a comfortable majority, with more than two thirds of the votes after adding up those of the conservative EPP (182 MEPs), Social Democrats (154), Renew Europe centrists (108) and Greens (75). As ever the biggest establishment party force will be the CDU/CSU, the alliance between the formation of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her Bavarian sister party, which will also have 29 deputies between them. This delegation forms the backbone to the European People's Party, the parliament's biggest political family, whose internal divisions have so far blocked progress on filling top EU posts. The EPP and the S&D can no longer agree on major decisions alone and centrist and Green elected officials are determined to use this new opportunity to advance their political priorities. But centrists allied to French President Emmanuel Macron also want to play a pivotal role, and deliver on the French leader's ambitions to shake up the EU.

Disappointed Venezuelans lose patience with Guaido as Maduro hangs on CARACAS/PUNTO FIJO, Venezuela (Reuters) - Four days before Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido launched a military uprising in a bid to oust President Nicolas Maduro, he told supporters at a rally outside the capital, Caracas: “In the next few days, we’ll decide our destiny.” The 35-year-old, who had risen to national prominence three months before, finished his speech with his usual rallying cry to Venezuelans desperate for the end of 20 years of Socialist rule: “We’re on track!” Yet after the April 30 insurrection swiftly unraveled, with troops remaining in their barracks and key government officials refusing to change sides, many Venezuelans aren’t so sure. Interviews with more than two dozen people across Venezuela - as well as fresh polling data - suggest that many people have grown frustrated by the slow pace of change amid the hardships of daily life. Several said they were losing hope that Guaido could dislodge Maduro. “We’re on track but it’s the wrong track,” said Rafael Narvaez, a taxi driver in the western coastal city of Punto Fijo. Narvaez said he had been full of hope on April 30 when he saw Guaido appear with military officers in a video posted on Twitter saying it was time to rise up against Maduro. “I thought that finally the moment had come to recover our country,” Narvaez, 43, said. “Now I’m disappointed.” Analysts said the most likely outcome now is for the status quo to continue as Maduro gains confidence that his crackdown on the opposition will go relatively unpunished and Guaido seeks a new strategy to keep a weary public energized. When Guaido, the speaker of the National Assembly, proclaimed a rival presidency in January in a bold challenge to Maduro, he injected new hope into Venezuela’s fragmented opposition. With most Western nations saying Maduro’s reelection last year was rigged, Guaido cited the constitution to announce an interim presidency until fresh elections could be held. Washington backed him and imposed tough new sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry, with the aim of forcing Maduro and his allies from power. Maduro, who took office in 2013 following the death of his political mentor, Hugo Chavez, has overseen an economic collapse that has left swaths of the once-wealthy country without reliable access to power, water, food and medicines. More than 4 million Venezuelans have emigrated and the Organization of American States warned this week that figure could double by the end of next year. Guaido has gained control of some Venezuelan assets in the United States, appointed diplomats overseas and unveiled an economic plan to rebuild Venezuela. But his promises of amnesty have failed to sway the armed forces, which remain loyal to Maduro. The opposition’s momentum has slowed since the April 30 uprising. Attendance at Guaido’s public rallies has dropped and the opposition has held no major protests since then. A march called for Friday will be a litmus test for Guaido’s support. Maduro, who retains the loyalty of key allies Russia and China, has branded Guaido a U.S. puppet. With a swift removal of Maduro not in sight, the opposition says it is knuckling down for a more protracted campaign and seeking to build a grassroots organization to press for elections without Maduro. Yon Goicoechea, a member of Guaido’s policy team, acknowledged there was “fatigue” among Venezuelans. “We have to fight against demobilization and despair,” he said. “We Venezuelans have to keep consistent in our support for Guaido and be patient.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."|"EU Parliament to elect its president on July 3"|"Tue Jul 02 14:24:00 CEST 2019"|"[world]"

""A terrorist attack at Abha International Airport...led to the injury of 9 civilians - eight Saudis and one Indian national,"" Coalition for the Support of Legitimacy in Yemen spokesperson Colonel Turki al-Maliki said in a statement. All injured are stable and under treatment at hospitals, Colonel al-Maliki was quoted as saying by the state-owned Saudi Press Agency (SPA). He blamed the Houthi militia for the attack, which took place shortly after midnight on Tuesday. ""In the face of these acts of terrorism and the immoral violations by the Houthi terrorist militia, the command of the coalition forces continues to carry out strict measures to deter these terrorist militias in order to protect the civilian and civilian assets,"" Colonel al-Maliki said. ""The terrorist elements responsible for the planning and execution of this terrorist attack will be held accountable in accordance with international humanitarian law and its customary rules,"" he added. Air traffic at the airport was not affected by the incident, tweeted the airport authorities. Earlier, the Houthi-run Al-Masirah TV said the rebels ""launched a wide operation targeting warplanes at Abha international airport"" with drones. The UAE strongly condemned the attack. In a statement, the UAE foreign ministry and International Cooperation said the security of the UAE and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is indivisible."" ""Any threat or danger to the (Saudi) Kingdom's security is considered a threat to UAE's security and stability,"" it said in a statement. The Yemeni rebels have stepped-up attacks in recent weeks against Saudi Arabia, targeting key facilities. On June 12, a missile attack on Abha airport by the Houthis injured 26 civilians, including an Indian. On June 23, another attack on Abha airport killed a Syrian national and injured 21 others. The Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen in March 2015 to push back an advance by the Houthis and to restore to power President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi. Since then, the conflict has killed tens of thousands of people, mostly civilians, pushing the Arab world's poorest country to the brink of famine. The Saudi-led coalition members include the UAE, Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, Sudan, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and Djibouti. The UN describes the Yemen conflict as the world's worst humanitarian crisis, with 24.1 million -- more than two-thirds of the population -- in need of aid.

Khan also revealed that the incarcerated former prime minister Sharif's sons tried to secure the release of their father with the help of ""two friendly countries."" Khan did not reveal the names of the two countries but said they just conveyed him the message but did not press for Sharif's release. ""They told me that we will not interfere,"" said Khan, who was accompanied by the adviser on Finance, Hafeez Sheikh, and Federal Board of Revenue Chairman, Shabbar Zaidi. Sharif, 69, has been serving a seven-year prison term at the Kot Lakhpat Jail in Lahore since December 24, 2018 when an accountability court convicted him in one of the three corruption cases filed in the wake of the apex court's July 28, 2017 order in the Panama Papers case. Sharif and his family have denied any wrongdoing and allege that the corruption cases against them were politically motivated. In May, the apex court rejected Sharif's review petition seeking bail on medical grounds and permission to go abroad for medical treatment. Khan said that those convicted for corruption would not be allowed to go away until they gave back the stolen money. ""They need to return the country's money first then they can go anywhere they want,"" he said. ""If Nawaz (Sharif) wants to go abroad for his medical treatment then he should return the looted money first and if Asif Ali Zardari has such an issue he should return the money,"" Khan told ARYNewsTV on Monday. ""The NRO will not be offered,"" he said, referring to a deal similar to the National Reconciliation Ordinance issued by former dictator Pervez Musharraf, under which cases against a large number of politicians and political workers were dropped. ""Two NROs issued by Musharraf to [PML-N's 'supreme leader'] Nawaz Sharif and [PPP Co-Chairman] Asif Ali Zardari destroyed the country... Later, both of them also gave NROs to each other,"" Khan said. The prime miniser added, ""Money launderers are being kept as VIPs. I have asked the law ministry to shift them to a jail where regular prisoners are kept."" ""A plea bargain can be allowed and no foreign country can do anything. They (Sharif and Zardari) will have to pay the money,"" he said. Former president Zardari is in the custody of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) for his role in three corruption cases. He has been named in a multi-million dollar money laundering case along with his sister Faryal Talpur. According to the NAB, the duo made transactions of Rs 150 million through alleged fake bank accounts. Khan also spoke about the economy and said that it would improve as the difficult time was over. Khan said his government had spent $ 10 billion on debt servicing on loans taken by the previous governments.

"70035819"|"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-elites-love-of-exotic-wildlife/articleshow/70035819.cms"|"[AFP]"|"KARACHI: Bilal Mansoor Khawaja beams as he runs his palms over the ivory coat of a white lion, one of thousands of exotic animals at his personal ""zoo"" in Karachi, where a thriving wildlife trade caters to Pakistan's gilded elite. ""These are... (some) of the rarest animals I own,"" boasts the 29-year-old industrialist of his leashed lion. Pakistani laws make it easy to import exotic animals, but once inside the country regulation is almost non-existent. This has led to an untold number of such creatures -- especially big cats, seen as symbols of wealth and power -- being imported or bred across Pakistan in recent years, much to the horror of helpless wildlife officials. Social media is littered with videos of wealthy Karachiites cruising with lions sitting in the front seats of luxury SUVs, while newspapers have featured reports of arrests of residents brazenly taking their big cats out for strolls and drives. Khawaja estimates there are up to 300 lions within Karachi's city limits alone, kept in gardens, inside rooftop cages, and at farm houses across the sun-baked metropolis of about 20 million -- notorious for its grinding traffic, crumbling infrastructure, and lack of greenspaces. Khawaja calls his handful of lions and a tiger the ""crown jewels"" of a larger collection of more than 4,000 animals he has amassed in recent years. He insists his collection -- made up of some 800 different species -- is not about status or prestige but simply a manifestation of his love for pets. ""We Pakistanis have a problem: where our heart is soft, it's very soft. Where it's hard, it's very hard,"" he gushes. To care for his flock, he has more than 30 people working in shifts and four vets on staff. The entire operation costs a fortune, Khawaja admits, although he refuses to provide an estimate of just how much he shelled out for his personal zoo. But the cost and the series of minor injuries he has accrued over the years at the hands of his prized pets are well worth it, he claims. ""With every injury my love for these animals... grows more,"" he smiles. His nine-acre property where a portion of his animals, including zebras, flamingos, and horses, reside is smack in the middle of a dense neighbourhood in the megacity. Exotic animal dealer Aleem Paracha, who claims to be one of the top three importers of exotic animals in Karachi, says that for 1.4 million rupees ($9,000) he can deliver a white lion to a client in up to 48 hours -- and do so entirely legally. Certificates from the countries of origin along with permits from authorities are provided for any animal brought into Pakistan in accordance with an international treaty to protect endangered species. But Paracha says there is also a network of breeders across Pakistan that can also provide lions at a moment's notice, including at least 30 in Karachi. ""In Karachi, lion farming is going very well,"" he explains. And while indigneous species are fiercely protected in Pakistan, the same protections are not extended to imported animals. The government has guidelines regarding the treatment and type of enclosures big cats and other exotic species should be provided with. But ""the law is silent"" on breeding, explains Javed Mahar, head of Sindh province's wildlife department. Uzma Khan, a technical advisor with the World Wildlife Fund, says there is not even an authority monitoring government-run zoos, which are notorious for neglect, let alone the private sector. ""There's lots of private breeders and they are very shady,"" Khan adds. Meanwhile owners like Khawaja may have the means and passion to provide the hearty diet for their animals, but others have been known to fall short. Karachi veterinarian Isma Gheewala says lions suffering from calcium deficiencies are common at her clinic, where she says she has treated between 100 to 150 big cats over the years. ""The bones become extremely brittle,"" she explains. ""And even if they jump like a foot down, they will injure some bone or the other and then it takes a long time for the animals to recover."" But both Paracha and Khawaja dismiss claims they are doing anything harmful by taking exotic species out of their natural habit and raising them in Pakistan. ""A lot of animals, either they're extinct or they're on the edge of being extinct,"" argues Khawaja, adding: ""I don't want the next generations to not see these animals."" But conservationists like Khan at the WWF dismiss such arguments. She explains: ""An animal in captivity is not the way it is in the wild. ""What's the point of having an animal which is not hunting, which is in a cage not showing its natural behaviour?""

The Metropolitan Police force said the body of an unidentified man was found in a residential garden in south London's Clapham area on Sunday, and it's believed he fell from a plane. He has not yet been identified. Police said a post-mortem would be held to determine the cause of death. Kenya Airways said police traced the body to its Nairobi-London flight. A bag, water and food were discovered in the plane's landing-gear compartment after it landed. The airline called the death ``unfortunate'' and said it was cooperating with British and Kenyan authorities. Stowing away in a plane's undercarriage is exceptionally dangerous. Experts believe roughly three-quarters of stowaways do not survive because of the extreme cold and lack of oxygen as the plane reaches cruising altitude. Though not common, stowaways have in the past plunged to the streets of London as planes lowered their landing gear. In September 2012, a 30-year old from Mozambique, Jose Matada, died after falling from the undercarriage of a Heathrow-bound flight from Angola.

The rush-hour blast, which sent a plume of smoke into the air and shook buildings nearly two kilometres (1.2 miles) away, was followed by gunmen storming a building and triggering a gun battle with special forces in the Puli Mahmood Khan neighbourhood of the Afghan capital. The health ministry said at least one person had been killed and 93 wounded. Among them were 50 children, the education ministry said in a statement, adding that most had been hurt by flying glass and were in stable condition. Some social media images purportedly taken at a hospital showed wounded, stunned children in school uniforms, still clutching books as they arrived for treatment. In its statement, the education ministry said five schools had been partially damaged, and asked ""all sides involved in fighting to guarantee the safety of students, teachers, education workers and schools"". The Taliban claimed the attack, which came just two days after the insurgents began a seventh round of talks with the US in Qatar as Washington eyes a breakthrough before Afghanistan's September presidential election. Militant spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said the insurgents had targeted a defence ministry building in the area, which was quickly blocked off by Afghan forces and ambulances, with helicopter gunships seen overhead as gunfire continued. Authorities have not confirmed the target, but Interior ministry spokesman Nasrat Rahimi said the area had been cordoned off by special forces who were ""bringing down"" the attackers, with at least two killed. ""Security forces also rescued 210 civilians from buildings nearby,"" he said. AFP reporters could hear gunshots and multiple smaller explosions as fighting continued nearly seven hours after the first blast. ""We were sitting inside the office when the world turned upside down on us,"" Zaher Usman, an employee at a branch of the culture ministry, which he said stands just 150 metres (yards) from the blast. ""When I opened my eyes, the office was filled with smoke and dust and everything was broken, my colleagues were screaming,"" Usman told AFP by telephone. Shams Amini, a spokesman for the Afghan Football Federation, told AFP that the blast occurred near their HQ gates, and said some colleagues had been injured. Nearby Shamshad TV station, which was attacked in 2017, aired images of broken glass and damage to its offices. ""I was terrified,"" Shamshad anchor Hashmat Stanikzai told AFP. A media watchdog said seven Shamshad journalists were among the wounded. The attack came as the US was set to begin a third day of negotiations with the militants in Doha. There was no immediate confirmation if they would go ahead after the blast. With the attack still ongoing, the Taliban spokesman in Doha again insisted that the insurgents will not negotiate with Kabul. ""Once the timeline for the withdrawal of foreign forces is set in the presence of international observers, then we will begin the talks to the Afghan sides, but we will not talk to the Kabul administration as a government,"" Suhail Shaheen tweeted. A potential deal would see the US agree to withdraw its troops after more than 17 years in Afghanistan, igniting deep concerns among Afghans who fear Washington will rush for the exits and allow the militants to return to some semblance of power. In return, the Taliban would guarantee the country would never again become a safe haven for violent extremism, as happened with al-Qaida before the September 11, 2001 attacks. However, US officials have insisted that ""nothing is agreed until everything is agreed"", including intra-Afghan talks.

""The two officials should be brought before a magistrate for their criminal negligence to prevent the April 21 attacks,"" de Livera said in a letter to the acting police chief. ""Their negligence amounts to what is known under international law to be grave crimes against humanity."" De Livera ordered acting police chief Chandana Wickramaratne to record statements from both suspects and produce them before a magistrate without delay. The attorney general said a presidential commission of inquiry had found ""major lapses"" by Fernando, who has since resigned from his position which was directly under President Maithripala Sirisena. While Fernando is the most senior defence official to face action, Sirisena suspended police chief Jayasundara after he refused to step down over the handling of the attacks. Jayasundara and Fernando have testified before a parliamentary inquiry and accused Sirisena of failing to follow established protocols in assessing threats to national security. Authorities have admitted that warnings sent by India of an impending attack by a local group, the National Thowheeth Jama'ath (NTJ), were ignored. Three churches and three luxury hotels in Colombo were hit by suicide bombers. Some 45 foreign nationals were among the dead and 500 people were injured in the attacks. The tourist hotspot has been under a state of emergency since. Sri Lanka's State Intelligence Service (SIS) has also been criticised for failing to act on the Indian warnings, but no-one from the state spy service has been put under investigation. Sirisena, who is also defence minister and law and order minister, has faced allegations that he too could have prevented the attacks. The president has objected to a parliamentary investigation into the attacks and ordered police not to co-operate. The hearings, however, have gone ahead. Indian intelligence shared information about the targets — gleaned from a jihadist in Indian custody — as early as April 4, more than two-and-a-half weeks before the attacks.

The explosion occurred as the streets in the capital were packed with morning commuters. Officials and police were at the scene of the blast and few details were available. Ambulance sirens screamed throughout the downtown area as they rushed to the scene. Mohammad Karim, a police official in the area of the attack, said a car bomb exploded outside a defense ministry building. Militants then ran into a nearby high-rise located in a crowded market and began firing down on the ministry. Police and special Afghan security forces were swarming the area and cordoned it off. A restaurant owner in the area, Mohammad Farooq, said the explosion blew out the windows of a nearby private school, wounding several students. Kabul's chief police spokesman, Firdous Faramaz, confirmed the explosion but did not provide details on the target or the type of explosive device. Health ministry official Wahid Mayer said at least 65 were wounded. He said it is difficult to reach the area because of the ongoing gunbattle between police and militants. The capital has been relatively quiet in recent months following a spate of bombings, many claimed by the local Islamic State affiliate. The Taliban, who have also carried out attacks in Kabul, said they had no claim of responsibility for Monday's blast. In recent months most Taliban attacks have targeted Afghan and U.S. military installations or convoys. The explosion came as the latest round of talks between the United States and the Taliban moves into a third day in the Middle Eastern state of Qatar, where the militant group maintains a political office. The Taliban said their focus during the talks is on getting an announcement of a timetable for the withdrawal of US and NATO troops from Afghanistan. The announcement is likely to be accompanied by a Taliban promise to hold intra-Afghan talks and agree to an eventual cease-fire. Suhail Shaheen, spokesman for the Taliban's political office in Doha, told The Associated Press on Monday that ""our main concern is to make sure a timeline for troop pullout is announced"". Taliban officials have previously told the AP they want all foreign troops withdrawn within six months, while Washington has pushed for a longer timeline of a year to 18 months. The Taliban have refused to hold talks with the Afghan government, calling it a US puppet. They say Washington is the final arbiter on the troop withdrawal, which the insurgents see as the central issue. Washington accelerated attempts to find a negotiated end to America's longest war with the appointment last September of Afghan-born American Zalmay Khalilzad, who was a special presidential representative to Afghanistan and later US ambassador in Kabul in the years immediately following the ouster of the Taliban. During a visit last week to the Afghan capital, US secretary of state Mike Pompeo said Washington would like to see an agreement before September 1, considered an ambitious deadline by analysts but likely linked to Afghan presidential polls scheduled for later that month. Washington has expressed concern the elections could hamper a peace deal and has quietly advocated for an interim administration for up to two years following an agreement.

In a rare public appearance, Joseph (Yossi) Cohen said his agency had formed a task force designed to spot peacemaking opportunities in a region where only two Arab states, Egypt and Jordan, have full ties with Israel. “The Mossad today espies a rare opportunity, perhaps for the first time in Middle East history, to arrive at a regional understanding that would lead to a comprehensive peace accord,” he told the Herzliya Conference, an annual international security forum near Tel Aviv. “Common interests, the fight against rivals such as Iran and Jihadist terrorism, the close relations with the White House and channels of communication with the Kremlin all combine to create what might be a one-time window of opportunity,” Cohen said. The United States convened Arab and other dignitaries in Bahrain last week to encourage investment in the Palestinian economy that might help renew peace talks with Israel. The Palestinians, seeing a pro-Israel bias in the Trump administration and a ruse to deny them their goal of full statehood, boycotted the Manama meeting. Israel, which sent only a non-official delegation, saw in the event a chance to bolster its wider ties to the Arab world. Washington hopes wealthy Gulf states will bankroll a U.S. plan for trade and investment, which expects donor nations and investors to contribute $50 billion to Palestinian and neighbouring Arab state economies. But the Palestinians and many Arabs in the region dismissed the economic plan as pointless without a political deal, a goal that repeatedly eluded previous peace efforts. “THUGGISH BEHAVIOUR” Cohen, whose speech alluded to the Palestinians only in the context of threats against Israel from the armed factions, said many Arab countries “cannot stand Iran’s thuggish behaviour”. He cited Iran’s nuclear programme, assistance for guerrillas in Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and elsewhere and alleged responsibility for a recent spate of sabotage strikes on oil tankers in the Gulf. Iran denies any role in those incidents. Cohen said Israel’s warming of relations with Oman, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited last October, followed “a lengthy covert effort by the Mossad” to seek out closer ties. He pointed to what he termed “an expanding group of responsible, serious countries” - which he did not name - in the region that have “open channels of communication with Israel”, but no formal relations, and cooperate with it in various ways. With Iran threatening to exceed the limitations of a 2015 deal capping its nuclear projects, and which the United States withdrew from last year, Cohen reaffirmed Israel’s policy that it would not allow its arch-foe to get a bomb. “The Mossad or the State of Israel did not sign the nuclear deal (and) will do everything to ensure that Iran will never have nuclear weaponry,” he said. On Monday, two sources told Reuters Iran had breached the limit of its enriched uranium stockpile set in the 2015 deal, defying a warning by European co-signatories to stick to the deal despite U.S. sanctions. Iran denies ever seeking to acquire a nuclear bomb. “Currently, it’s about uranium enrichment at a relatively low percentage, and in amounts that are not large. The threat is to step up enrichment and increase the amounts,” Cohen said, before news of the enrichment breach. “Just imagine what will happen if the material stockpiled by the Iranians becomes fissionable, at military-enrichment grade, and then an actual bomb. The Middle East, and then the entire world, will be a different place. Therefore, the world must not allow this to happen.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."|"Israeli spymaster says 'one-time' chance for peace with Arabs sharing Iran worries"|"Mon Jul 01 18:47:00 CEST 2019"|"[world]"

""Iran has crossed the 300-kilogramme limit based on its plan,"" Zarif told ISNA, saying Tehran had set out its intentions ""very clearly"" in May. The United States withdrew from the nuclear deal last year and reimposed biting sanctions on Iran as part of its ""maximum pressure"" campaign. In retaliation on May 8 Tehran announced it would no longer respect the limit set on its enriched uranium and heavy water stockpiles. It also threatened to go further and abandon more nuclear commitments unless the remaining partners — Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia — helped it to circumvent sanctions, especially to sell its oil. The EU said Friday after a crisis meeting aimed at salvaging the deal that a special payment mechanism set up to help Iran skirt the sanctions, known as INSTEX, was finally ""operational"" and that the first transactions were being processed.

The semi-official Fars news agency quoted a source as saying that the United Nations’ International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) had measured the stockpile on Monday. The IAEA was not immediately available for comment. Enriching uranium to a low level of 3.6% fissile material is the first step in a process that could eventually allow Iran to amass enough highly-enriched uranium to build a nuclear warhead. Last Wednesday, the IAEA verified that Iran had roughly 200 kg of low-enriched uranium, just below the deal’s 202.8 kg limit, three diplomats who follow the agency’s work told Reuters. On Monday, the IAEA was not immediately available for comment. After talks on Friday in Vienna, Iran said European countries had offered too little in the way of trade assistance to persuade it to back off from its plan to breach the limit, a riposte to U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision last year to quit the deal and reimpose economic sanctions. The deal between Iran and six world powers lifted most international sanctions against Iran in return for restrictions on its nuclear work aimed at extending the time Iran would need to produce a nuclear bomb, if it chose to, from roughly 2-3 months to a year. Iran says its nuclear programe is solely for peaceful purposes, including generating power. In May, Washington piled pressure on Tehran by ordering all countries to halt imports of Iranian oil, and tensions have been growing in the Gulf ever since. Washington has dispatched extra forces to the Middle East, and U.S. fighter jets came within minutes of conducting air strikes on Iran last month after Tehran downed an unmanned American drone. In a speech on Monday broadcast live on state TV, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said: “Iran will never yield to pressure from the United States ... If they want to talk to Iran, they should show respect ... “Never threaten an Iranian ... Iran has always resisted pressure, and has responded with respect when respected.” Trump has called for negotiations with Iran with “no preconditions”, but Tehran has ruled out talks until the United States returns to the nuclear pact and drops its sanctions.

Police used riot shields and pepper spray to push back hundreds of helmeted protesters who tried to advance down closed streets toward the harborfront venue, where the Chinese and Hong Kong flags were raised together and two helicopters and a small flotilla passed by. Hong Kong leaders, mainland China representatives and invited guests watched the ceremony on a screen inside the city's cavernous convention center instead of outside as they normally do. The government cited inclement weather after intermittent light rain earlier in the morning. City leader Carrie Lam said a series of protests and marches that have attracted hundreds of thousands of students and other participants have taught her that she needs to listen better to the youth and people in general. Lam has come under withering criticism for trying to push through legislation that would have allowed suspects to be extradited to the mainland to face trial. ""This has made me fully realize that I, as a politician, have to remind myself all the time of the need to grasp public sentiments accurately,'' she said in a five-minute speech to the gathering. She insisted her government has good intentions, but said ""I will learn the lesson and ensure that the government's future work will be closer and more responsive to the aspirations, sentiments and opinions of the community.'' Security guards pushed pro-democracy lawmaker Helena Wong out of the room as she walked backward shouting at Lam to resign and withdraw the ""evil'' legislation. She later told reporters she was voicing the grievances and opinions of the protesters, who could not get into the event. An annual march Monday afternoon was expected to be larger than usual because the proposed extradition bill has awakened broader fears that China is eroding the freedoms and rights guaranteed to Hong Kong for 50 years under a ""one country, two systems'' framework. Two marches in June against the legislation drew more than a million people, according to organizer estimates. The government has suspended debate on the bill indefinitely, but protest leaders want it formally withdrawn and Lam's resignation. They also are demanding an independent inquiry into police actions during a June 12 protest, when officers used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse protesters who blocked the legislature on the day debate on the bill had been scheduled to resume. The police say the use of force was justified, but have since adopted softer tactics, even as protesters besieged police headquarters in recent days, pelting it with eggs and spray-painting slogans on its outer walls. The area around Golden Bauhinia Square, where the flag-raising ceremony took place, was blocked off from Saturday to prevent protesters from gathering to disrupt it. Protesters started setting up barricades across nearby streets about 4:30 a.m., leading to a standoff with police blocking access to the square. They began moving toward the police about 45 minutes before the 8 a.m. ceremony. The line of officers drove them back with plastic shields and batons, the retreating protesters pointing open umbrellas to ward off pepper spray. ""We are horrified, this is our obligation to do this, we are protecting our home,'' said Jack, a 26-year-old office worker who would only give his first name. ``I don't know why the government is harming us. It's harming the rule of law, the rule of law is the last firewall between us and the Chinese Communist Party.'' Television footage showed protesters on an overpass throwing eggs and an orange and white construction barricade at police as they battled other protesters below.

Rana Sanaullah, a member of Pakistan’s National Assembly and PML-N’s president of Punjab province, was arrested by the anti-narcotics force (ANF) on the Islamabad-Lahore motorway. “Huge amounts of illicit drugs were recovered from Sanaullah’s car. However, the weight is being measured to know the exact amount,” ANF officials alleged. Maryam Nawaz, PML-N vice-president and daughter of jailed former PM Nawaz Sharif blamed PM Imran Khan for the arrest, accusing him of being “directly behind” the arrest. “What has ANF got to do with Rana Sanaullah? It could not get more absurd. He has been arrested for his bold & courageous stance. Jaali-e-Azam (PM Imran Khan) being the small & petty-minded man that he is, is directly behind his arrest.

He described the arrest as the worst example of lawlessness and political vendetta. Sharif alleged it was another example of using state institutions against political opponents. He demanded government produce Sanaullah before a court of law. Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairman Bilawal Bhutto also tweeted his condemnation of the arrest, calling it an attempt at “political victimization”. “Arrest of president Punjab PML-N by Anti-Narcotics force is obviously desperate attempt at political victimization. Sanaullah has been a vociferous critic of PPP in the past & is currently one of the most vocal critics of the regime. Arrests expose govts weakness & desperation,” Bilawal said.

Muhammad Ajmal committed the attack as revenge for a suspected affair by his wife Kiran, said Imran Mehmood, a District Police Officer for the city of Multan, where the killings occurred. Ajmal returned to Pakistan from Saudi Arabia, where he worked as a tailor, 25 days ago intending to carry out the killings, he said. Mehmood said Ajmal confessed to the killings. “This is clearly an honour killing. He saw a picture of his wife with another man and believed she was having an affair,” Mehmood said. “He does not repent his actions.” In addition to killing his wife and their two children, Ajmal also killed his three sisters-in-law, two of their children, and his mother-in-law. Ajmal and his father, who was with him at the time of the murder, are both in custody and have been charged with murder, Mehmood said. Police are searching for his brother, who is also believed to be involved. The deaths add to the hundreds of women and girls killed in Pakistan each year, according to human rights groups, by family members angered at the perceived damage to their honour, which may involve eloping, fraternizing with men or any infringement of conservative values regarding women. Kiran’s brother Ali Raza told Reuters that Ajmal and his sister were having marital problems and she had recently moved back to Pakistan and was living with her family. “I am left with just my father, my whole family is gone,” he said. Mehmood said Ajmal has not been assigned an attorney yet and Reuters was unable to contact any of his family members for a comment. Pakistan adopted legislation against honour killings in 2016, introducing tough punishment and closing a legal loophole that allowed killers to walk free if pardoned by family members. Police in Pakistan’s most populous province of Punjab, where honour crimes have been rampant, said recently that the number of such killings had fallen since the law was introduced but rights groups estimate that nearly 1,000 such killings take place annually.

A notice about the route guidelines issued to pilots by the CAA stated that Pakistan’s airspace for nine eastern routes for flights to and from India was to remain shut for another fortnight. Meanwhile, the two southern routes that Pakistan had opened for Indian flights in April will remain functional. Without giving further details on closure of airspace, it said the government will review the matter after two weeks. Islamabad had shut the airspace on February 26 this year following the Indian airstrikes inside Pakistan on a Jaish-e-Mohammad terror camp in Balakot, in retaliation to a suicide bombing that killed 44 Indian security personnel in Pulwama, Kashmir on February 14. On June 21, well-placed sources had told TOI that Pakistan was likely to keep the airspace shut for India until there was some assurance from New Delhi that Balakot-like incident will not be repeated in future. The ban, according to sources, will remain in place until the issue is raised and resolved at the top level between Islamabad and New Delhi. On March 27, Pakistan had opened its airspace for all flights except for New Delhi. Since May 15 the ban on eastern airspace has been extended four times. Stating that the closure was due to security and diplomatic reasons, a top CAA official said on the condition of anonymity that in the last four months of the ban, flag carriers of both the countries had incurred huge losses. Since the closure of Pakistani airspace, the Indian aviation industry, according to media reports, is incurring more losses than Pakistan.

The PIA operations for Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur and New Delhi have been suspended since Feb 26. Before the ban, PIA operated four flights to Kuala Lumpur, two to Bangkok and two to New Delhi in a week.

Her apartment complex in Fairless Hills, about 30 miles northeast of Philadelphia, is the same one where officials removed 20 venomous snakes from another apartment in March. Officials aren't sure if the cobra had escaped from that unit. Wildlife officials say people who spot snakes should call police and let experts handle the situation.

Harris, 54, who was born in the US to an Indian mother and a Jamaican father who were both immigrants, has directly confronted critics before who have questioned her black heritage. Harris, Senator from California, was the target of birtherism-like attack, the latest jabs to racism faced by former President Barack Obama, CNN reported. ""Birtherism,"" promoted by some Republicans, including President Donald Trump before he assumed the presidency, was a movement that denied former President Obama was a natural-born US citizen, implying he was ineligible to be president. ""Kamala Harris is *not* an American Black. She is half Indian and half Jamaican,"" the critic, who identified as African American, tweeted on Thursday. ""I'm so sick of people robbing American Blacks (like myself) of our history. It's disgusting. Now using it for debate time at #DemDebate2? These are my people not her people. Freaking disgusting,"" the critic tweeted. The viral tweet by right-wing personality Ali Alexander, has also gone by the name Ali Akbar, The New York Times reported. The tweet was however, re-tweeted by President Trump's son Donald Trump Jr. Trump, a valuable Republican surrogate as his father faces a bruising 2020 race, posted the tweet of unverified information, then asked his more than three million followers: ""Is this true? Wow,"" the report added. ""Don's tweet was simply him asking if it was true that Kamala Harris was half-Indian because it's not something he had ever heard before,"" said the spokesman, Andy Surabian, ""and once he saw that folks were misconstruing the intent of his tweet, he quickly deleted it."" Harris officially launched her campaign in January for the US presidential election next year. If elected, Harris would create history by becoming the first woman in the White House. Lily Adams, the campaign communications director for Harris, dismissed the attack, explaining that people, including President Trump, used similar rhetoric to question Obama's birthplace. Obama was born in Hawaii. ""This is the same type of racist attack his father used to attack Barack Obama,"" Adams told CNN. ""It didn't work then and it won't work now."" Harris has often resisted sharing her personal background on the campaign trail. But during Thursday's debate, she confronted former Vice President Joe Biden about his history opposing busing and said she herself had been bused to a public school. Biden, however, defended Harris on Saturday, saying in a tweet that ""racism has no place in America."" ""The same forces of hatred rooted in 'birtherism' that questioned @BarackObama's American citizenship, even his racial identity, are now being used against Senator @KamalaHarris,"" Biden said. ""It's disgusting and we have to call it out when we see it."" Of the 2020 Democratic hopefuls, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren appeared to be the first on Saturday to defend Harris. ""The attacks against @KamalaHarris are racist and ugly,"" Warren tweeted. ""We all have an obligation to speak out and say so. And it's within the power and obligation of tech companies to stop these vile lies dead in their tracks."" Other Democrats on the campaign trail chimed in. Washington Governor Jay Inslee accused the Trump family of ""peddling birtherism,"" an apparent reference to the president's attacks against Obama. US Representative Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, also compared the online attacks, which claim Harris is not a black American because her father is Jamaican, to ""birtherism,"" whose proponents claimed incorrectly that Obama was born in Kenya. ""The attack on @KamalaHarris is racist and we can't allow it to go unchecked,"" Ryan tweeted. ""We have a responsibility to call out this birtherism and the continued spread of misinformation."" Indian-Americans constitute 1 per cent of the American population and are one of the fastest growing minorities in the country.

The large crowds, most of them dressed in white or blue, illustrated the ideological fissures now running through the finance hub as it experiences its worst political unrest in a generation. Hong Kong saw two record-breaking rallies earlier this month by protesters opposed to a now postponed plan to approve extradition to mainland China. But it has also been rocked by unprecedented clashes. On 12 June police used tear gas and rubber bullets to clear largely young anti-extradition protesters from around parliament. The police classified the demonstration as a riot and defended their tactics but opponents have accused officers of using excessive force and called for an independent inquiry. Twice in the last two weeks the city's police headquarters has been blockaded by angry crowds. Sunday's rally -- comprised of a noticeably older demographic, some waving Chinese flags -- was smaller than the huge anti-extradition marches but nonetheless showed that the police and pro-Beijing establishment still had plenty of supporters. ""I can't put up with peoples' behaviour towards police,"" 70-year-old demonstrator Frances Yu told AFP. A 54-year-old office worker, who gave his surname as Wong, said officers were trying to ""maintain order"" and that anti-extradition demonstrators had gone too far. ""It's like they went crazy, those who charged, lambasted police... I find it so senseless,"" he told AFP. Many supporters turned out with children in tow, portraying themselves as a silent and peaceful majority. But there were also tense moments. At one of the subway entrances near the rally some half a dozen pro-democracy protesters were hissed and booed by a much larger crowd of police supporters, some of whom shouted profanities. Police and other supporters had to step in to calm tempers. Others screamed insults at journalists and at pro-democracy protesters camped out at the entrance to parliament. Much of the artwork and posters pinned to the city's parliament walls by anti-extradition protesters were torn down by police supporters as they passed by. The pro-democracy camp will hold another rally on Monday, with organisers expecting a huge turnout. The extradition protests were the latest manifestation of growing fears, especially among young Hong Kongers, that China is trampling on the city's unique freedoms and culture -- aided by the pro-Beijing government. Years of protests calling for Hong Kongers to be able to elect their leaders have won no concessions from Beijing. There is also a staunchly nationalist, pro-establishment strain that runs through the city, especially among older generations, who regard pro-democracy protesters with disdain.

The two men shook hands warmly and expressed hopes for peace when they met for the third time in just over a year on the old Cold War frontier that for decades has symbolised the hostility between their countries, which are technically still at war. Trump, escorted by Kim, briefly crossed a military demarcation line into the North. Moments later, they returned to the South Korean side and joined South Korea's President Moon Jae-in for a brief chat, marking an unprecedented three-way gathering. Trump and Kim then held a closed-door meeting for nearly an hour. ""The meeting was a very good one, very strong ... We agreed to work out details,"" Trump said. ""We'll see what can happen,"" He said both sides would set up teams to push forward stalled talks aimed at getting North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, adding he was in no rush for a deal. Trump and Kim met for the first time in Singapore in June last year, and agreed to improve relations and work towards the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. But there has been little progress since then. A second summit in Hanoi, Vietnam, in February broke down after the two sides failed to narrow differences between a US demand for North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons and a North Korean demand for sanctions relief. Kim looked relaxed and smiled as he chatted with Trump amidst a throng of press photographers, aides and bodyguards. ""I was surprised to see your message that you wanted to meet me,"" he told Trump, referring to Trump's Saturday offer, in a Twitter posting, to meet. ""This is an expression of his willingness"" to work towards a new future, Kim said. 'GREAT DAY' Kim said it would be a great honour if Trump visited his capital of Pyongyang. ""To cross that line was a great honour,"" Trump said, referring to his brief incursion into the North Korean side of the DMZ. ""It's a great day for the world,"" he said. ""We moved mountains"" to arrange the meeting at such short notice, he said. Trump arrived in South Korea late on Saturday for talks with Moon after attending a Group of 20 summit in Osaka, Japan, during which he made the surprise, spur-of-the-moment offer to meet Kim, who accepted it. Trump and Kim met in the so-called Joint Security Area (JSA), which is patrolled by soldiers from both Koreas. Moon joined the two after their initial handshakes. Trump said he had ""plenty of time"" and was in ""no rush"" to reach a deal. ""We want to get it right,"" he said. North Korea has pursued nuclear and missile programmes for years in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions, and easing tensions with North Korea is one of the US president's top foreign policy priorities. The DMZ was set up after the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a truce, leaving North Korea and a US-led UN forces still technically at war.

The attack comes as a new round of talks between the United States and the Taliban to end the 18-year long war in Afghanistan entered a second day in Qatar. The militants rammed four armoured vehicles packed with explosives into a government compound in Maruf district late Saturday, a police spokesman in southern Kandahar province said. ""Unfortunately 11 policemen were martyred and 27 more injured,"" Qasim Afghan told AFP. Eight election workers who were stationed at the centre to register voters ahead of the presidential polls in September were also killed in the attack, said Zabiullah Sadaat, a spokesman for Afghanistan's Independent Election Commission (IEC). Afghanistan's twice-delayed presidential election is now slated for September 28. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, with a spokesman tweeting that their fighters had captured the district centre, killing 57 security forces. Afghanistan's interior ministry however rejected the claim, saying in a statement that the militants had been beaten back and 25 insurgents killed. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani condemned the ""barbaric and unforgivable"" attacks, which are the latest in a relentless wave of assaults by the Taliban, who now hold sway over about half of the country and regularly target government forces. The insurgents killed at least 25 members of a pro-government militia in an attack in northern Baghlan province on Saturday. The violence comes amid stepped-up efforts by the United States to find a negotiated end to America's longest war, with Washington and the Taliban opening a fresh round of negotiations in Doha on Saturday.

Palestinian minister for Jerusalem affairs Fadi al-Hadami was detained and was being questioned for ""activities in Jerusalem"", Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told AFP. Hadami's arrest was most likely due to recent activities that have included accompanying Chile's president during a visit to Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque complex, a source close to the minister told AFP. On Tuesday, Hadami was seen alongside Chilean President Sebastian Pinera on a tour of the flashpoint holy site, enraging Israel, which said it constituted a violation of regulations and a breach of understandings reached with Santiago for the head of state's visit. The status of Al-Aqsa, known to Jews as the Temple Mount and located above the Western Wall, is one of the most sensitive issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It is the holiest site in Judaism and the third-holiest for Muslims after Mecca and Medina, administered by the Muslim Waqf but secured by Israeli police. Chile later said Pinera's visit was private, with Hadami's presence not part of official protocol. The arrest follows days of violent unrest in Jerusalem. Overnight Saturday, Israeli police ""continued dealing with riots and disturbances in a number of neighbourhoods when stones were thrown at officers and fireworks fired at them,"" Rosenfeld said in a statement. Two officers were wounded and six suspects arrested, Rosenfeld said. The continued unrest follows the shooting of a 20-year-old Palestinian in the east Jerusalem neighbourhood of Issawiya by Israeli police, after he had allegedly thrown fireworks at them. The young man, identified as Mohammed Obeid, died of his wounds, according to the Palestinian health ministry. Israel occupied east Jerusalem and the West Bank in the 1967 Six-Day War. It later annexed east Jerusalem in a move never recognised by the international community. Israel sees all of Jerusalem as its undivided capital, while the Palestinians see east Jerusalem as the capital of their future state.

The world's two largest economies are in the midst of a bitter trade war, which has seen them level increasingly severe tariffs on each other's imports. In a sign of significant progress in relations on Saturday, Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump, on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Osaka, agreed to a ceasefire and a return to talks. However, the official China Daily, an English-language daily often used by Beijing to put its message out to the rest of the world, warned while there was now a greater likelihood of reaching an agreement, there's no guarantee there would be one. ""Even though Washington agreed to postpone levying additional tariffs on Chinese goods to make way for negotiations, and Trump even hinted at putting off decisions on Huawei until the end of negotiations, things are still very much up in the air,"" it said in an editorial late Saturday. ""Agreement on 90 percent of the issues has proved not to be enough, and with the remaining 10 percent where their fundamental differences reside, it is not going to be easy to reach a 100-percent consensus, since at this point, they remain widely apart even on the conceptual level."" Trump also offered an olive branch to Xi on Huawei Technologies Co, the world's biggest telecom network equipment maker. The Trump administration has said the Chinese firm poses a national security risk given its close ties to China's government, and has lobbied U.S. allies to keep Huawei out of next-generation 5G telecommunications infrastructure. The Chinese government's top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, in a lengthy statement about G20 released by the Foreign Ministry following the delegation's return to Beijing, said the Xi-Trump meeting had sent a ""positive signal"" to the world. Though problems between the two countries remain, China is confident as long as they both follow the consensus reached by their leaders they can resolve their problems on the basis of mutual respect, Wang said in the statement released late Saturday. Trump's comments on Huawei, made at a more than hour-long news conference in Osaka following his sit-down with Xi, generated only a cautious welcome from China. The word ""Huawei"" was not mentioned at all in the top diplomat's appraisal of G20. Wang Xiaolong, the foreign ministry's special envoy of G20 affairs and head of the ministry's Department of International Economic Affairs, said if the United States does what it says on Huawei then China would of course welcome it. ""To put restrictions in areas that go beyond technology and economic factors will definitely lead to a lose-lose situation. So if the U.S. side can do what it says then we will certainly welcome that,"" Wang told reporters. The pause in tensions is likely to be welcomed by the business community, and markets, which have swooned on both sides of the Pacific due to the trade war. Jacob Parker, vice-president of China operations at the US-China Business Council, said returning to talks was good news for the business community and added much needed certainty to ""a slowly deteriorating relationship"". ""Now comes the hard work of finding consensus on the most difficult issues in the relationship, but with a commitment from the top we're hopeful this will put the two sides on a sustained path to resolution."" China's position as the trade war has progressed has become increasingly strident, saying it would not be bullied, would not give in to pressure, and that it would ""fight to the end"". Taoran Notes, an influential WeChat account run by China's Economic Daily, said the United States was now aware that China was not going to give in, and that tariffs on Chinese goods were increasingly unpopular back home. ""We've said it before - communication and friction between China and the United States is a long-term, difficult and complex thing. Fighting then talking, fighting then talking, is the normal state of affairs,"" it said.

It is part of the civilian effort to help defend the last major rebel stronghold from Assad and his Russian allies who have been pounding it for weeks. Abu Abdo, 51, says he is playing his part by collecting old tyres to be burned by fighters to create a smoke screen from hostile warplanes. ""We go to places where tyres are repaired, collect them and take them to the fighters,"" said Abu Abdo, 51, as he piled tyres into the back of a truck with the help of his sons in the town of Salqin. ""These tyres have no value but protect (the fighters) and keep the enemy busy,"" said Abu Abdo, as two of sons sat atop the pile of tyres in the back of the truck. In recent years, Assad's opponents have poured into northwestern Syria from other parts of Syria that have been taken from rebels. The region, which includes Idlib province and parts of neighbouring provinces, has an estimated 3 million inhabitants, about half of whom had already fled fighting elsewhere according to the United Nations. With nowhere else for these people to flee, many have a stake in fending off the attack on the northwest. To this end, activists and religious leaders launched a campaign in May called ""fire an arrow with them"". Volunteers at work in a kitchen in the town of Atarib are preparing 2,000 meals a day for fighters as part of the campaign. Yellow rice is spooned from large vats into polystyrene trays and lentil soup is poured into bags ready for delivery to fighters. ""The car leaves from here to the frontlines under air strikes and surveillance sometimes,"" said a 40-year-old man at work in the kitchen who gave his name as Abu Wael. ""God willing we continue so these meals reach the fighters."" Filling sand bags, digging trenches At a nearby quarry, sacks that once contained rice were being filled with grit for use as sandbag defences. ""We are filling according to the demand of the frontline. The command centre, for example, requests 200 bags or 1,000 bags for one position,"" said Khaled al-Jamal, 26, at work with a group of other volunteers. He finished his high school education but was unable to register at university once the war began in 2011. He hopes his effort will help fighters so ""all their effort is directed at repelling the regime"". In Salqin, men use shovels, pick axes and pneumatic drills to dig a trench in an olive grove as part of another civilian campaign, this one called ""the Popular Resistance Battalions"". A long way from the frontline, Yehya al-Sheikh, 38, says the trench he is digging with others will provide protection from air strikes for a family living nearby. ""We came to dig trenches to defend ourselves and our people and to support our Mujahideen brothers against Bashar al-Assad."" Some 300,000 people in the northwest have been uprooted since late April and local sources have reported that hundreds of civilians including women and children have been killed, the UN 0ffice for the coordination of humanitarian affairs says. The territory is largely controlled by Tahrir al-Sham, a jihadist group representing the latest incarnation of the Nusra Front, formerly al-Qaida’s Syrian wing, though groups fighting under the banner of the Free Syrian Army also have a presence.

Moro, who was a powerful judge before joining President Jair Bolsonaro's cabinet in January, has faced calls for his resignation over leaked chats purportedly showing he worked with prosecutors in the so-called Car Wash probe to keep Lula, a popular leftist, out of the 2018 presidential race. Demonstrators took to the streets in Brazil's main cities, including the capital Brasilia, Rio de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte, to show their support for Moro, who is considered a hero by many Brazilians fed up with corrupt leaders. In the latest messages published by The Intercept investigative website, prosecutors expressed concern that Moro had a personal and political agenda in the probe and were unhappy over his appointment to the far-right government, which they feared would undermine the credibility of the probe. Moro has questioned the authenticity of the leaked chats and dismissed claims that he had been biased in the Car Wash cases. He recently told a Senate committee that he had been the victim of ""revenge"" over his anti-corruption efforts. No one has been untouchable in the Car Wash probe, which began in 2014 and upended Brazilian politics by uncovering large-scale looting of state oil company Petrobras. Scores of top players across the political spectrum as well as business figures have been taken down. But critics say Moro — who handed Lula his first conviction for taking bribes and money laundering in 2017, effectively ending both his election hopes and decades of center-left rule in Brazil -- targeted the former president and his popular Workers' Party (PT) most of all. The Supreme Court last week postponed debate on whether Moro had been impartial. Lula, who led Brazil through a historic boom from 2003 to 2010, has denied all the corruption charges against him. He has long argued they were politically motivated to prevent him from competing in the 2018 election that was ultimately won by Bolsonaro.

Work on the Beijing Daxing International Airport officially ended on schedule Sunday, ready for a September 30 inauguration -- on the eve of the anniversary of the foundation of the People's Republic on October 1, 1949 by Mao Zedong. Celebrations of that event will see President Xi Jinping reviewing a huge military parade through the centre of Beijing, with the opening of the futuristic hub a fitting embodiment of the ""Chinese dream"" he has offered his fellow citizens. Located 46 kilometres south of Tiananmen square, the new airport will operate at full capacity in 2025, with four runways and the potential to receive 72 million passengers per year. By 2040 the hub is expected to have expanded to eight runways including one for military use, and will be able to welcome 100 million passengers per year -- which will make it the world's largest single terminal in terms of traveller capacity, according to its designers. Atlanta airport, in the United States, can currently receive more than a hundred million passengers, but across two terminals. The current Beijing Daxing International Airport -- the world's second largest -- is already overflowing, with just over 100 million passengers annually. Air transport is booming in China as living standards increase along with peoples' desire to travel. Indeed, it will pass the US to become the world's biggest aviation market by the mid-2020s, according to the International Air Transport Association. The country will see 1.6 billion plane journeys each year from 2037 -- a billion more than in 2017, the organisation estimates. China's capital -- with its 21 million people -- expects to welcome 170 million passengers in 2025, split between the two airports. At 700,000 square metres -- about the size of a hundred football pitches -- the new structure will be one of the world's largest airport terminals. The building was designed by Anglo-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid, who died in 2016, in conjunction with the engineering subsidiary of Aeroports de Paris. Inside, it stands out for its flowing, curved lines and use of light that filters down to the lowest levels of the building through openings in the roof. Underneath the terminal is a train station and metro line that will allow travellers to reach the city centre in 20 or so minutes. The project cost 120 billion yuan ($17.5 billion), or 400 billion if rail and road links are included. State television channel CCTV reported that the SkyTeam alliance, which includes Delta Air France and KLM, will move over to the new airport along, along with its partner Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlines. The third largest Chinese airline, Air China, is expected to keep flying the bulk of its flights from Beijing Capital International Airport.

He also accused Putin of hypocrisy for saying that he wanted LGBT people to be happy after reports that gay scenes in ""Rocketman"", the movie based on the singer's life, had been censored in Russia.

Several people have died around the continent in incidents that authorities are linking to the weather. A massive wildfire spanning 10,000 acres raged in Spain, sparked when a pile of chicken dung spontaneously combusted in the heat. Several countries have reported record temperatures this week, and France hit its all-time heat record on Friday: 45.9°C (114.6 F) in the small southern town of Gallargues-le-Montueux, according to French media. The French national weather service activated its highest-level heat danger alert for the first time, putting four regions around Marseille and Montpellier in the south of the country under special watch Friday. About 4,000 schools were closed because they couldn’t ensure safe conditions. Authorities canceled several cultural and sport events and many end-of-school-year carnivals. City halls were also sending volunteers to visit the elderly at home to ensure they had fans and water. In the northern Paris suburb of Saint-Denis, the Salvation Army day center, which allows migrants living in the streets to take showers, also provided them with lots of bottled water. “This heatwave is exceptional by its intensity and its earliness,” French PM Edouard Philippe told reporters. “Measures have been taken for the most vulnerable people,'” he said. “But given the intensity, it’s the entire population who must be careful today ... both for oneself and for loved ones and neighbors.” Italy put 16 cities under alerts for high temperatures, and civil security services distributed water to tourists visiting famed sites around Rome under a scorching sun. The heat killed at least three people as temperatures soared in central and northern Italy, while hospitals in the financial capital Milan saw a 35% rise in emergency visits due to heat-related conditions. Demand for power in the city surged as people cranked up air conditioning causing sporadic blackouts in stores and restaurants. Temperatures are forecast to ease in the coming days but will remain hot. Heat was also blamed for the deaths of two people in Spain, private news agency Europa Press reported on Friday. An 80-year-old man collapsed and died in the street in Valladolid, in northwest Spain, the agency said, and a 17-year-old boy died in the southern city of Cordoba after diving into a swimming pool and losing consciousness. Four people have drowned in France this week, and a 12-year-old girl drowned in a river near Manchester, England. France’s health minister and British police warned people to swim only in authorised areas. France has also seen an uptick in so-called street-pooling, or illegally opening fire hydrants. A 6-year-old child is in life-threatening condition after being hit by water shooting from a cracked-open fire hydrant in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis, broadcaster France-Info reported. More than 200 firefighters dealt with dozens of fires in the Gard region, in southeastern France, and a highway was closed for safety reasons. More than 600 firefighters and six water-dropping aircraft were battling the worst fire in two decades in Catalonia on Friday, as Spain is forecast to endure the peak of its heat wave, with temperatures expected to exceed 40°C (104°F). In Berlin, a police unit turned water cannons — usually used against rioters — on city trees, to cool them down. The World Meteorological Organisation said on Friday that temperature records for this time of year have been broken in Germany, France, Spain, Switzerland and Austria. It had said this week that 2019 was on track to be among the world’s hottest years, and 2015-2019 would then be the hottest five-year period ever. It said the heatwave was “absolutely consistent” with extremes linked to the impact of greenhouse gas emissions.

Temperatures in France's southern Gard region hit an all-time high of 45.9 degrees Celsius (114.62°F) on Friday - hotter than in California's Death Valley - sparking scores of fires that burned 550 hectares of land and destroyed several homes and vehicles. One man died while competing on Saturday in a cycling race in the southwestern Ariege region, in the foothills of the Pyrenees. The 53-year-old crashed after feeling unwell, local public prosecutor Laurent Dumaine said on Sunday, adding police were investigating the precise cause of death. The race was called off after several participants were taken sick due to the heat, organisers said. Another cyclist died in the southern region of Vaucluse, with authorities attributing the man's collapse to the heatwave. Meteorologists say a weakening of the high-level jet stream is increasingly causing weather systems to stall and leading summer temperatures to soar. Five of Europe's hottest summers in the last 500 years have happened in this century. Some 25 out of around 90 administrative departments in France have adopted limits on water use including for agriculture, which could affect harvest yields for summer crops like maize that are often irrigated. ""The heatwave has also hit the vineyards of Herault, widespread damage observed,"" Jerome Despey, a wine producer in France's southwestern Herault region and head of the local chamber of agriculture said on Twitter, posting photos of shrivelled grapes. Extreme risk In Spain, 40 out of 50 regions have been put under weather alert with seven of them considered to be an extreme risk, the national weather agency said. Temperatures in Girona, in northeastern Spain, reached 43.9 degrees on Friday - the highest ever recorded in the Catalan city. Most of the wildfires that hit Spain in recent days were stabilized over the weekend, but firefighters were struggling to control a blaze in the central provinces of Toledo and Madrid, that has burned more than 20 sq km (7.7 sq miles) since Friday. Temperatures eased slightly on Sunday although the Spanish national meteorological agency predicted the mercury could stay over 40 degrees Celsius in some parts of the country, in particular in the northeast. At least seven heat-related deaths have been reported in recent days: In addition to the two French cyclists, two people have died in Spain and three in Italy. Race against global wrming Germany's weather service warned of ""extreme"" heat on Sunday, forecasting peak temperatures of up to 39 degrees Celsius from Saxony in the east to the upper Rhine in the west. That's just below an all-time high of 40.3 Celsius. People enjoy bathing at a beach by the Baltic Sea in Travemuende, Germany on June 30, 2019. In Frankfurt, 3,000 athletes took part in an IronMan endurance race despite the heat. Female race leader Sarah True of the United States collapsed within a kilometre of the finish line of the closing marathon stage. True, who had already completed a 3.8 km swim and 185 km bike ride, was carried off the course and had to be restrained by first-aid workers concerned for her wellbeing, live footage broadcast by Germany's ARD public television showed. ""It felt like a race against global warming - you could have fried an egg on my head,"" said Sebastian Kienle, who finished second in the men's race. The World Meteorological Organization said this week that 2019 was on track to be among the world's hottest years on record, which would make 2015-2019 the hottest five-year period. The European heatwave was ""absolutely consistent"" with extremes linked to the impact of greenhouse gas emissions, according to the WMO. Addressing thousands of people in St. Peter's Square for a Sunday address and blessing, Pope Francis said he was praying for those suffering most from the heat wave - the sick, the old, construction workers and those who had to labour outdoors.

Racist trolls began attacking Harris within hours of the Democratic debate on Thursday in which she claimed the black heritage and questioned her fellow Democrat Joe Biden’s record on race. From questioning her eligibility to run for the White House in a replay of the “birther” issue they used against Barack Obama, to suggesting she was not sufficiently black because her mother was Indian (her father was Jamaican), right-wing trolls sought to undermine Harris’ bid for the Democratic nomination that has got a boost after her performance in last week’s debates. The attacks were implicitly and briefly endorsed by President Trump’s son Donald Trump jr., who retweeted, and then deleted, an alt-right commentator named Ali Alexander, who argued that “Kamala Harris is implying she is descended from American Black Slaves. She’s not. She comes from Jamaican Slave Owners. That’s fine. She’s not an American Black. Period.” Harris was also attacked by some African-Americans who claimed she was wrongly usurping their blackness. ""Kamala Harris is *not* an American Black. She is half Indian and half Jamaican,"" a critic, who identified as African American, wrote. ""I'm so sick of people robbing American Blacks (like myself) of our history. It's disgusting. Now using it for debate time at #DemDebate2? These are my people not her people. Freaking disgusting."" Although it is well-documented that Harris was born in Oakland, California (just as it was well-recorded that Barack Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii), conspiracy theorists and racists trolls fueled posts that she was either an ""anchor"" baby or born in Canada to maintain that she is ineligible to run for the White House. ""Anchor baby"" is a term used to refer to a child born to a non-citizen mother in a country that has birthright citizenship that will help the mother and other family members gain legal residency. That attack misfired when left-wing trolls argued that Trump's own children could be construed as anchor babies since he married immigrant women who may not have been US citizens when the children were born. Harris’ mother Shyamala Gopalan was a cancer researcher who immigrated to the US from Chennai (then Madras) and her father Don Harris was an economics professor. They met as graduate students at Stanford. Kamala and her sister Maya, who is also a Democratic operative who has worked on the Hillary Clinton campaign, had a mixed upbringing, going to both a Hindu Temple and a Baptist church. The controversy over race, ever present in U.S politics, surfaced at the debate itself when Harris told Democratic front-runner Biden that his past stance against federally-mandating busing black students to white schools was personally hurtful because she had benefited from that educational opportunity as a little girl. ""That little girl was me,"" Harris said emotionally, identifying herself as a Black American. Her performance led to a surge of support fundraising in her fight for the Democratic nomination against front runners Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren, all of whom were polling higher numbers than her. By some accounts she raised $2 million within 24 hours after the debate, with her team cranking up her outreach using highlights from the debate where she upstaged her opponents. Still, her fellow Democrats aspiring to clinch the party nomination backed her against the racists' attacks. “The attacks against @KamalaHarris are racist and ugly,” Warren tweeted shortly after.

And it’s… https://t.co/crRCa0HnT8 &mdash; Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) 1561835669000 “We all have an obligation to speak out and say so. And it’s within the power and obligation of tech companies to stop these vile lies dead in their tracks.” Bernie Sanders sneered: “Donald Trump Jr. is a racist too. Shocker.” And from Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg: “The presidential competitive field is stronger because Kamala Harris has been powerfully voicing her Black American experience.

Addressing the final sitting of the budget session in the National Assembly (NA), Khan quoted former US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice as saying in her biography that former military ruler Gen Pervez Musharraf was asked by Washington to drop corruption cases against members of the current Opposition. “The US wanted these people in power because they had promised to protect Washington’s interests,” he said. “Condoleezza Rice’s account showed that those talking about ‘selected’ were themselves manufactured in the nursery of military dictatorship,” he added. During Khan’s speech, only members of the treasury were present as opposition lawmakers had walked out of the session in protest against the speaker’s ruling that the house was in order despite lack of quorum was pointed out by the Opposition. Last week, NA’s deputy speaker had banned the use of the word “selected” to describe PM Khan. Since Khan took over last year, opposition lawmakers in Pakistan’s NA and Senate have been calling him a “selected” PM. It is widely believed by critics and independent observers that the powerful military had cleared the path for him and his Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party to form government by allegedly rigging polls last year. The word was first used for Khan by Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, who had referred to him as a “selected” PM while congratulating him in the opening session of NA last year. Since then, the prefix “selected” has continuously been used in press conferences, on TV talk shows and at public rallies. Talking about the ban on the word “selected” in Parliament, leader of the opposition in NA Shahbaz Sharif said the word was neither inappropriate nor abusive. “What word should we use as its replacement,” he asked.

Trump then became the first sitting American leader to step into North Korea. The brief photo-op, another historic first in the yearlong rapprochement between the two technically warring nations, marks a return to face-to-face contact between the leaders since talks broke down during a summit in Vietnam in February. But it does little to erase significant doubts that remain about the future of the negotiations and the North's willingness to give up its stockpile of nuclear weapons. Trump's brief crossing into North Korean territory marked the latest milestone in two years of roller-coaster diplomacy between the two nations, as personal taunts of ""little rocket man"" and threats to destroy the other have been ushered out by on-again, off-again talks, professions of love and flowery letters. ""I was proud to step over the line,"" Trump told Kim as they met in a building known as ""Freedom House"" on the South Korean side of the village. ""It is a great day for the world."" Kim hailed the moment, saying of Trump, ""I believe this is an expression of his willingness to eliminate all the unfortunate past and open a new future."" He added that he was ""surprised"" when Trump invited to meet by a tweet on Saturday. Peering into North Korea from atop Observation Post Ouellette, Trump told reporters before meeting Kim that there has been ""tremendous"" improvement since his first meeting with the North's leader in Singapore last year. Trump claimed the situation used to be marked by ""tremendous danger"" but ""after our first summit, all of the danger went away."" But North has yet to provide an accounting of its nuclear stockpile, let alone begin the process of dismantling its arsenal. The meeting at the truce city of Panmunjom also represented a striking acknowledgement by Trump of the authoritarian Kim's legitimacy over a nation with an abysmal human rights record. Trump's summit with Kim in Vietnam earlier this year collapsed without an agreement for denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. He became the first sitting U.S. president to meet with the leader of the isolated nation last year, when they signed an agreement in Singapore to bring the North toward denuclearization. North Korea's nuclear threat has not been contained, Richard Haas, the president of the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations, tweeted Sunday. Haas added that the threat of conflict has subsided only because ""the Trump administration has decided it can live (with) a (North Korean) nuclear program while it pursues the chimera of denuclearization."" Substantive talks between the nations have largely broken down since the Vietnam summit. The North has balked at Trump's insistence that it give up its weapons before it sees relief from crushing international sanctions. The U.S. has said the North must submit to ""complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization"" before sanctions are lifted. Every president since Ronald Reagan has visited the 1953 armistice line, except for George H.W. Bush, who visited when he was vice president. The show of bravado and support for South Korea, one of America's closest military allies, has evolved over the years to include binoculars and bomber jackets. Trump, ever the showman, sought to one-up his predecessors with a Kim meeting. The leaders met at a time of escalating tensions. While North Korea has not recently tested a long-range missile that could reach the U.S., last month it fired off a series of short-range missiles. Trump has brushed off the significance of those tests, even as his own national security adviser, John Bolton, has said they violated U.N. Security Council resolutions.

""US companies can sell their equipment to Huawei,"" Trump told reporters in Osaka hours after sealing a tariff truce with Chinese President Xi Jinping. ""We're talking about equipment where there's no great national security problem with it."" It was not immediately clear whether Trump's comment marked a material change in the stance toward Huawei, which has essentially been barred on national security grounds from accessing crucial American technology or operating in the US market. The US fears that systems built by Huawei — the world leader in telecom network equipment and number two smartphone supplier — could be used by China's government for espionage via built-in secret security ""back doors"". Huawei vigorously denies that and says the US has never provided proof to substantiate it. Last month the US government added Huawei to an ""entity list"" of companies barred from receiving US-made components without permission from Washington. Trump's comment on its face does not mark a change from current practice. But it could be read by financial markets as a positive signal that his administration may be open to negotiating on Huawei when bilateral trade talks resume. However, any softening on Huawei could meet resistance from a bipartisan US congressional movement that is calling for a hardline on the firm. A Huawei spokesperson told AFP the company had no inital comment. Trump has imposed tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports in an effort to force Beijing into intellectual property protection and other reforms of a trading system that Washington says gives China huge unfair advantages. But Trump and Xi struck a ceasefire deal on Saturday, with Washington vowing to hold off on further tariffs and the two sides agreeing to restart trade negotiations. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week that Xi planned to ask Trump in Osaka to ease up on Huawei as a precondition for signing a possible trade deal. Asked by reporters in Osaka what was discussed regarding Huawei, a Chinese foreign ministry official said he did not know, but that China would welcome lifting the US ban. ""Putting restrictions on technology will lead to a situation where all sides lose. So if the US lifts the sanctions, we would welcome that,"" said the official, Wang Xiaolong.

According to media reports, the wife of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum - the Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE - is believed to be in hiding in London. The princess, the half-sister of King Abdullah of Jordan, is said to be seeking a divorce after initially fleeing to Germany with her children Jalila, 11, and Zayed, seven where she requested political asylum. She is understood to have taken 31 million pounds with her to start a new life, reports say. Oxford educated Princess Haya has not been seen in public since May 20 and her social media accounts, which are usually full of photos of her charitable work, have not been active since February. Unconfirmed reports in Arab media say that a German diplomat helped the princess ""escape"" from Dubai, leading to a potential diplomatic crisis between the two countries. It is claimed that German authorities refused a request from Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Maktoum, one of the world's richest men, to return his wife to Dubai. Two sources close to the Dubai royal family were cited as saying by media reports that Princess Haya has indeed left the country and is seeking a divorce. It comes after one of the Sheikh's daughter's Princess Latifa attempted to flee from her father and Dubai. She was captured on a boat off the Indian coast and has since disappeared, but is believed to have been returned to the UAE. Princess Latifa said abuse forced her to flee the kingdom with human rights groups claiming that she is being held in captivity in Dubai. Radha Stirling, Chief Executive of watchdog Detained in Dubai, said: ""Whenever someone applies for political asylum, obviously, it is because their lives are in danger, and because they have suffered severe abuses and violations of their human rights. ""We already know that Princess Latifa, Sheikh Mohammed's daughter, fled the UAE seeking asylum and alleging unspeakable abuse at the hands of her father. ""Now, it seems, Princess Haya, Sheikh Mohammed's wife, has also fled the country and sought refuge in Germany."" She said there are now ""serious questions"" about what prompted Princess Haya to flee.

Singapore joins dozens of other cities around the world in celebrating gay pride this weekend but it is the only one where gay sex is criminalised, although the law is not enforced. Pressure for change in the city-state has increased since India's top court struck down colonial-era criminalisation of homosexuality last year. Elsewhere in the region, Taiwan recently became the first Asian country to legalise same-sex marriage. ""The majority of Singaporeans are tolerant. But for us to be accepted, we have a long way to go,"" said Elaine, 26, a banker who attended the rally with her girlfriend. ""But I'm happy that the government doesn't stop or disallow events like this to happen,"" she added, asking to give only her first name. Under the law, a man found to have committed an act of ""gross indecency"" with another man could be jailed for up to two years, although prosecutions are rare. The law does not explicitly ban homosexual acts between women. Previous legal challenges to overturn the ban have failed but shortly after the landmark Indian court ruling, a Singapore DJ filed a new court challenge against the colonial-era law. For 32-year-old public relations executive Devane Sharma, the criminalisation of gay sex has repercussions on the society even if prosecutions do not take place. ""The government often says that the law isn't really enforced so it's okay, but there are ripple effects on the rest of society, especially in matters on sexual health and workplace discrimination,"" Sharma said. The gay pride rally has been held since 2009 under stringent public assembly laws at Speakers' Corner, an area set aside for demonstrations, performances and exhibitions for citizens and permanent residents only. During its six decades since independence, Singapore has emerged as a modern, wealthy city-state. Lawmakers, however, remain cautious over social reforms, partly due to sensitivities stemming from the ethnic and religious mix among Singapore's 5.6 million inhabitants. But there was an optimistic mood among the marchers at Saturday's rally: ""It's a matter of time. I think within a few years, the law will (be repealed). I am hopeful,"" Sharma said.

The award-winning website Bellingcat said late Friday that its joint analysis with the BBC helps establish the command structure Moscow's GRU network of foreign agents used to poison former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and conduct other attacks. London and Washington identify the GRU as Russia's main security threat to Western interests abroad. Russia denies involvement in the Skripal case and calls other allegations against the GRU- including its attempted hacking of the world's chemical weapons watchdog in The Hague last year- politically motivated. The findings ""shed light on the likely chain of command for this (and other) GRU overseas operations, with one coordinating senior officer communicating with headquarters in Moscow while the team on the ground receive limited to no new instructions,"" the Bellingcat report said. ""Evidence obtained by us on other international operations involving the same team suggests that this is a stable GRU operational model."" Britain's Metropolitan Police said it could not comment on an ""ongoing investigation"". British officials have identified the two Russians suspected of delivering the nerve agent to Salsbury as GRU agents Alexander Mishkin and Anatoly Chepiga. Both men entered Britain using false passports and were captured on CCTV footage walking around the southern English town shortly before Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found slumped over on a park bench. They fell into comas but survived and have since gone into hiding. Mishkin and Chepiga later told Russian television that they were tourists who went to Salsbury to look at the local cathedral. Western intelligence agencies suspect that the Kremlin ordered Skripal's killing in retribution for his past exposure of Russian spies. Bellingcat discovered in February that a GRU agent named Denis Sergeev- alternatively spelled as Sergeyev- was also in Britain at the same time. The website found that Sergeev was in Bulgaria during the 2015 poisoning of a local arms dealer who suffered similar symptoms to Skripal's. Bulgaria has asked Britain and Russia for cooperation after reopening that case. Joint findings by the BBC and Bellingcat detail Sergeev's movements and mobile phone communications while in London in March 2018. The BBC's report established that Sergeev was a major general- a rank just three below that of an army commander. ""The involvement of a GRU major general would indicate the unusually high importance of the operation,"" Bellingcat wrote. The BBC found that Sergeev used messaging apps such as WhatsApp and Telegram to communicate with both the two Russians in Salsbury and his Moscow commander. Bellingcat said Sergeev's Moscow contact was using an unregistered mobile phone card that ""does not produce a regular 'footprint' left by regular numbers"". The BBC's Russian Service separately reported that Sergeev and his wife ""listed the address of the GRU training academy as their own home on an official registry"". Russian President Vladimir Putin told the Financial Times in an interview published on Thursday that he viewed ""treason (as) the gravest crime possible"". ""I am not saying that the Salisbury incident is the way to do it ... but traitors must be punished,"" Putin told the newspaper.

Despite Washington's concerns and threats over Ankara's push to buy Moscow's S-400 missile defence system, Erdogan reiterated that the purchase was a ""done deal"". Erdogan said the S-400 was expected to be delivered in the first half of July. He said Turkey previously held talks with former president Barack Obama's administration for the similar Patriot system, but Congress did not allow the deal to move forward.

Earlier today, Trump arrived at Osan Air Base in Gyeonggi Province on Air Force One plane and was received by South Korean and US officials including the country's Ambassador to South Korea, Harry Harris, Yonhap News Agency reported. Trump then boarded a Marine One helicopter which took him to a US military base in Yongsan located in central Seoul. He continued the rest of the journey by a car to reach the South Korean presidential office or the Cheong Wa Dae, where he was received by Moon. The two leaders then took a stroll around the office complex and shared cocktail drinks together before holding a dinner meet at Sangchunjae pavilion, a beautiful structure modelled after a traditional Korean house, according to the news report. The dinner meeting comes ahead of Trump's scheduled visit to the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) on Sunday. The DMZ serves as the de facto border between North Korea and South Korea. In his previous visit in 2017, Trump had planned to visit DMZ along with Moon but was shelved due to poor weather conditions. During the ongoing visit, Trump is expected to hold a meeting with over a dozen South Korean business leaders at a hotel before holding bilateral talks with Moon. Resuming the stalled denuclearisation talks between the US and North Korea is expected to feature during the negotiations. Talks between the two countries hit a roadblock after the second summit in Vietnam ended abruptly with no joint statement being released. The two sides reportedly failed to resolve their differences over sanction waiver. North Korea tested multiple short-range missiles last month as a sign of apparent frustration over the stalled negotiations and continuing sanctions. Pyongyang has repeatedly insisted that the removal of sanctions will help spur economic growth, while Washington has reaffirmed that sanctions will not be removed till the communist country completely stopped its nuclear weapons programme. After wrapping up his engagements in Osaka, Trump had expressed his wish to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-un at the DMZ. ""While there, if Chairman Kim of North Korea sees this, I would meet him at the Border/DMZ just to shake his hand and say Hello(?)!"" he tweeted. A few hours later, North Korea reciprocated Trump's tweet and said that it was a ""very interesting suggestion."" ""If this is realised, it would serve as another meaningful occasion in further deepening the personal relations between the two leaders and advancing the bilateral relations,"" North Korea's First Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui said in a statement carried by KCNA.

Kicked out of the G-20's more exclusive cousin G-8 in 2014 for annexing Crimea, Putin is now not the only one defending illiberal views on issues ranging from sexuality to immigration, even winning a vague endorsement from US counterpart Donald Trump. ""The liberal idea has become obsolete. It has come into conflict with the interests of the overwhelming majority of the population,"" Putin told the Financial Times in an interview ahead of the summit. He criticised Germany for welcoming immigrants, saying multiculturalism was letting immigrants ""kill, plunder, rape"" without punishment - and was understanding to Trump's idea of building a wall on the Mexican border. On Saturday, he repeated that western liberal policies on sexuality and gender identity were being forced on people, often children, and that parents who opposed this were ""often jailed."" ""Overreach"" by proponents of liberalism is what caused protests in Europe and Trump's surprise election, Putin said. Putin's views, undiplomatically expressed in a language usually reserved for his domestic working class constituency rather than global leaders, touched a few nerves in Osaka and beyond. ""What I find really obsolete are authoritarianism, personality cults, the rule of oligarchs, even if sometimes they may seem effective,"" EU President Donald Tusk said. Elton John accused Putin of hypocrisy: while the Russian leader denied violating rights of LGBT community, John's recent film Rocketman was heavily censored in the country to cut out all scenes of gay intimacy. French President Emmanuel Macron also countered, saying: ""I am convinced that, in a world full of uncertainty, liberal democracies still have a lot to offer."" But Trump, asked if he agreed with Putin, said the Russian leader ""sees what's going on"", before adding that US cities San Francisco and Los Angeles are ""sad"" because they are run by an ""extraordinary group of liberal people."" A political veteran first elected president in 2000, Putin had initially adhered to liberal ideas, but his advisers from those days are some of his biggest critics now. Since then, he has punished opposition, silenced media and sided with most Russians in criticising the liberal economic policies of predecessor Boris Yeltsin. Criticism followed by sanctions from the West was met with increasingly anti-Western policies, while lobbying of the Russian Orthodox Church has increased in recent years, resulting in conservative laws. Opposition politicians point out that pro-Kremlin figures or media figures who uphold Putin's conservative, anti-Western rhetoric often have mansions in Europe, while their children attend Western schools, suggesting that the traditionalist and patriotic fervour is just an act. But Putin's public lashing of western liberalism could be a bid to unite right-wing or conservative forces that oppose liberal values, analyst Vladimir Frolov said. ""It's a bid for a crusade against liberalism,"" he told Dozhd television channel.

Judge Haywood S. Gilliam, Jr. in Oakland acted in two lawsuits filed by California and by activists who contended that the money transfer was unlawful and that building the wall would pose environmental threats. ""All President Trump has succeeded in building is a constitutional crisis, threatening immediate harm to our state,"" said California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who led a 20-state coalition of attorneys general in one lawsuit. Speaking Saturday at a press conference marking the end of the Group of 20 summit in Osaka, Japan, Trump called the decision ""a disgrace."" ""So we're immediately appealing it and we think we'll win the appeal,"" he went on to say. ""There was no reason that that should have happened. And a lot of wall is being built."" The decisions are in line with Gilliam's ruling last month that blocked work from beginning on two of the highest-priority projects one spanning 46 miles (74 kilometers) in New Mexico and another covering 5 miles (8 kilometers) in Yuma, Arizona. But the fight is far from over. The US 9th Circuit Court of Appeals is expected to take up the same issue of using military money next week. At issue is President Donald Trump's February declaration of a national emergency so that he could divert $6.7 billion from military and other sources to begin construction of the wall, which could have begun as early as Monday. Trump declared the emergency after losing a fight with the Democratic-led House that led to a 35-day government shutdown. The president identified $3.6 billion from military construction funds, $2.5 billion from Defense Department counterdrug activities and $600 million from the Treasury Department's asset forfeiture fund. The judge Friday didn't rule on funding from the military construction and Treasury budgets. In the second suit, brought by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of Sierra Club and the Southern Border Communities Coalition, the judge determined that the use of the $2.5 billion for two sectors of the wall was unlawful, although he rejected environmental arguments that wall construction would threaten species such as bighorn sheep.

In an oblique swipe at Trump's messaging, which some commentators saw as a pressure tactic before his meeting with Modi, India's new external affairs minister S Jaishankar tweeted, ""India-US relations are guided by the Big Picture- the Vision set out by our leaders,PM Modi & President Trump in 2017.

In fact, along with India, Japan and Germany were also subjected to a Trump twitter-lashing ahead of the summit. He complained that under existing treaty provisions, if the United States were attacked, Japan would only ""watch it on a Sony television,"" and he called Germany a security freeloader.

Many U.S analysts and historians have pointed out that the Trump either does not know or ignores historical events relating to World War Two that compelled Germany and Japan to accept US security umbrella. The President's critics also pointed out that in contrast with his rants against allies and partners, Trump refrained from any criticism of Russia and its leader Vladimir Putin, who are accused of manipulating the 2016 US Presidential election to favor Trump, and Saudi Arabia, whose leader is said to be responsible for the death of a dissident columnist and who has close business ties with the Trump family. Trump's critique of India's tariff hike ignored, willfully or otherwise, the basis for it: New Delhi raised raised tariff's on 28 categories of imports in retaliation to the US increasing tariffs on aluminum and steel, and its revocation of a preferential trade status for more than $5 billion in imports from India.

There's only one catch -- at 1,000 euros ($1,130) a kilo, it may well be the most expensive cheese in the world. Since 2012, Simic and his team of farmers have been milking a herd of more than 200 donkeys who live on a nature reserve northern Serbia called Zasavica. Their milk has similar properties to breastmilk and is touted by Simic as a cure for a range of ailments, including asthma and bronchitis. ""A human baby can take this milk from the first day, without having it diluted,"" he says, calling it a ""wonder of nature."" While a lack of scientific studies make it difficult to assess its health properties, the milk is high in protein and has been recognised by the UN as a good alternative for those with allergies to cow's milk. But ""what no one in the world does, and could never make, is the donkey cheese,"" Simic says of his flagship product. Donkey milk has low levels of casein -- a type of protein that acts as a binding agent in cheese-making. But a staff member at Zasavica discovered that portions of donkey milk could be mixed with some from goats in order to craft the crumbly mounds of cheese. The mixture also helps make up for the fact that donkeys produce less than a litre of milk a day -- a fraction of the 40 litres a cow can provide. The farm sells between six and 15 kilos of cheese a year, mainly to foreigners and tourists who visit, says Simic. They also produce donkey milk soap and liquor. For Simic, the business is also a way to protect the Balkan donkey, an animal that has become less prevalent as machines take their place in agriculture. ""We are maintaining the need for this animal and now there are more and more donkey farms, the demand for donkeys is higher... which is a very good thing for us and the region,"" he says. The unique product made headlines in 2012 after false rumours spread that Serbia's tennis star Novak Djokovic had bought up an annual supply -- which he denied.

Wang, 43, was sentenced to four-and-a-half years in prison in January for ""subverting state power"" following a closed-door trial. A prominent lawyer who defended political activists and victims of land seizures, Wang vanished in a sweep aimed at courtroom critics of Communist authorities known as the ""709"" clampdown because the arrests started on July 9, 2015. Wang was held incommunicado for over 1,000 days without access to his family or a lawyer prior to his trial and authorities have repeatedly denied requests by his wife Li Wenzu to visit him in jail. ""My husband's health has deteriorated during the long incarceration, he had lost so much weight,"" Li told AFP. ""When I asked him what he had for breakfast, he kept scratching his head. But he couldn't remember,"" she said. ""It was really emotional. This was the first time my son and I got a chance to see him after being separated for four years."" The couple's six-year-old son, Wang Guangwei, was a toddler when his father disappeared. Li saw her husband at the Linyi jail in the eastern province of Shandong, where he was transferred in May after years spent at a detention centre in Tianjin. ""I felt like he was not the earlier Wang Quanzhang,"" his sister Wang Quanxiu, who was also at the meeting, told AFP. ""He was very agitated when he spoke to us. He had made a draft about what to discuss and had to constantly keep looking at his notes to remind himself of what to say,"" she said. Wang Quanzhang was the last of more than 200 lawyers and activists swept up in the 2015 crackdown to be tried or released. Li, who has actively protested against her husband's detention and sentencing, has repeatedly demanded proof of life from the authorities. She was placed under de facto house arrest the day before Wang's December 26 trial to prevent her from attending. Earlier that month, before Wang's court date was announced, Li and three supporters shaved their heads and tried to submit a petition to a Beijing court, protesting against his detention. In April last year, she attempted to march 100 kilometres (60 miles) to the Tianjin detention centre where Wang was previously held. Earlier this week, a video was posted on Twitter showing Li shouting over the prison wall asking whether Wang Quanzheng was alive. It was only on Thursday morning that she received a call from Shandong provincial authorities saying she would be allowed a 30-minute visit. ""I've never really known if he was alive all these years, and finally there was a clear message I can meet him,"" Li tweeted Thursday. Authorities had also called Wang Quanxiu Thursday at about 11 am and told her she could meet her brother at 2 pm that day. ""I rushed to the Linyi jail as soon as I received the call, but when I got there it was already 5 pm so I missed the chance to see him that day,"" Wang Quanxiu said. ""We have been calling the prison authorities all week to no avail, and then suddenly they changed their mind."" The timing of the meeting, which coincides with the G20 summit in Japan, has led to speculation that the Chinese Communist Party ""might be offering a compromise"" to embellish China's checkered human rights record, said Chan Yue, an activist from the Human Rights Concern Group in Hong Kong. Beijing has stepped up its crackdown on civil society since President Xi Jinping took power in 2012, tightening restrictions on freedom of speech and detaining hundreds of activists and lawyers.

According to the report, the Iraqi diplomat was told the attack by Iraqi protesters on the Bahraini Embassy in Baghdad was ""an irresponsible behavior that is strongly rejected.'' The attack, apparently carried out by supporters of Iranian-backed Iraqi militias, is unlikely to mar relations between Iraq and Gulf Arab nations, which have steadily been improving since Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi took office. Also, Iraqi President Barham Saleh received a call Friday from the king of Bahrain. King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa praised the relations between the two counties and ways of ``boosting them, for the good of the two peoples,'' Saleh's office said. The embassy attack sought to denounce a conference held in Bahrain to promote peace between Arabs and Israelis. The protesters broke through the main gate, took down Bahrain's flag and replaced it with a Palestinian one. No one was hurt in the incident. Iraqi security officials said 54 people have been detained for taking part in the attack. Bahrain's Foreign Ministry said those behind the assault ``should be brought to justice.'' An Iraqi security official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations, said precautionary measures have been taken in Baghdad to protect diplomatic missions. Bahrain's flag was raised again at the embassy on Friday. Iraq is home to Iran-backed militias and the embassy attack comes amid tensions between the United States and Iran. Iraq has close relations with both Washington and Tehran and has been trying to ease tensions between them. The crisis gripping the Mideast stems from President Donald Trump's withdrawal of the US last year from the nuclear deal between Iran and other world powers and his imposing of crippling new sanctions on Tehran.

Iran is threatening to exceed the maximum amount of enriched uranium allowed it by the deal, in retaliation for crippling US economic sanctions imposed in the past year. It is just days away from that limit, diplomats say, and going over it could unravel the accord. Senior officials from Iran and the deal’s remaining parties will meet with the aim of saving the pact. But with European powers limited in their ability to shield Iran’s economy from US sanctions, it is unclear what they can do to provide the large economic windfall Tehran wants. On Friday, Iran’s Fars news agency quoted foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi as saying, ""I think this meeting can be the last chance for the remaining parties...to gather and see how they can meet their commitments towards Iran."" Mousavi said that despite supporting Iran’s stance in several statements, the remaining signatories - Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia - had failed to take any action. Fars also quoted Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi, who is in Vienna, as saying Iran had run out of ""strategic patience"", and adding, ""Iran will not tolerate remaining unilaterally committed to the nuclear deal."" He said he hoped the Vienna meeting could lead to ""tangible"" action, the agency said. The European powers have set up a mechanism for barter trade called Instex, in an effort to protect at least some of Iran’s economy from the US sanctions. Instex would net out amounts at either end but is not yet operational and diplomats have said it will only be able to handle small volumes of items such as medicine, not the large oil sales Iran is seeking. ""We should see how much money can be transferred via Instex,"" Mousavi said. ""If it’s an artificial mechanism, Iran will surely not accept it."" Trade between Germany and Iran has collapsed under the impact of US sanctions, data published by Funke newspapers showed, supporting Iran’s assertion that Europe is failing to help preserve the nuclear non-proliferation deal it signed.

Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the Osaka meeting, Rebiya Kadeer said strong world pressure was essential to free an estimated one million people, mostly ethnic Uighurs, held in internment camps in western China. ""(The) entire Uighur people are facing (an) existential threat, and its real and urgent,"" Kadeer, the 72-year-old head of the World Uyghur Congress, said through an interpreter. Chinese officials describe the camps as voluntary ""vocational education centres"" where Turkic-speaking Uighurs receive job training. But rights groups and former inmates describe them as ""concentration camps"" where Uighurs and other minorities are being forcefully assimilated into China majority ethnic Han society. Kadeer said Uighur culture could vanish if ""strong actions"" are not taken by China's trading partners. ""I call (on) European countries who are economically dependent on China to wake up and stand up against Chinese genocide of Uighurs and take practical actions immediately."" More than 100 demonstrators later gathered in Osaka to protest against the camps, as well as moves in Hong Kong to diminish the Chinese city's unique freedoms. Kadeer's presence in Osaka will no doubt anger China, which labels her a dangerous separatist and has previously condemned Japan for allowing her entry. Kadeer extended her thanks to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the summit's host, for resisting Beijing's pressure. Xinjiang is a remote, resource-rich region bordering on central Asia that has long seethed with sporadic violence over Uighur allegations of Chinese repression. Kadeer was a successful Xinjiang businesswoman hailed in the 1990s by China as proof that its policies were good for the country's many ethnic minorities. But she fell out with authorities and was jailed six years after complaining about Uighur repression. She was released and went abroad in 2005, settling in the United States and becoming leader of the World Uyghur Congress, which advocates respect for Uighur culture. China accuses her of instigating deadly Uighur rioting in Xinjiang in 2009 that killed at least 197 people, according to state media. She strongly denies the charge.

""At the moment the situation is incredibly tense, getting worse and worse,"" Carola Rackete, captain of the Sea-Watch 3 told journalists in Rome, via a live video-link from the ship. ""It's very difficult for them all psychologically,"" said the 31-year old, who has become a symbol of defiance and a left-wing hero in Italy for challenging Interior Minister Matteo Salvini's ""closed-ports"" policy. She has warned that those rescued are victims of trauma and are being hit hard by the uncertainty over their fate. The Dutch-flagged Sea-Watch 3 has been stuck in the Mediterranean, during a heat wave, since rescuing 53 migrants drifting in an inflatable raft off the coast of Libya on June 12. The most vulnerable people were evacuated, but Salvini insisted the rest were unwelcome. On Wednesday, after over two weeks at sea, and as tempers on the small boat frayed, Rackete decided she had no choice but to enter Italian waters illegally to bring the remaining 42 migrants to safety. Salvini has called for her to be slapped with a hefty fine and face legal action, and he wants the ship seized. While a sick 19-year-old migrant and his young brother were evacuated from the vessel Thursday, on Friday the ship was still stuck off the island of Lampedusa. It had tried to enter the port -- where demonstrators have been massing in support -- but was blocked by police. ""The mood on the ship is quite bad,"" Rackete said. Salvini has said the migrants can only disembark if they head straight to the Netherlands, where the Sea-Watch 3 is registered, or to Germany. The head of the far-right League party has seen his popularity inch steadily upwards on the anti-immigrant platform. On Thursday, EU Migration Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos said Brussels was ""closely involved in coordinating with the member states to find a solution for relocating the migrants on board Sea-Watch 3 once they are disembarked."" According to Italian media reports, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte had a long chat with his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Osaka in Japan on Friday. Five Italian left-wing MPs spent the night onboard the ship in a gesture of solidarity. ""We'll remain onboard until all of the migrants have disembarked,"" said Graziano Delrio, who was the minister in charge of the Italian coastguard between 2015 and 2018. Salvini has called for the Sea-Watch 3 to be seized and its crew to be arrested for aiding and abetting illegal immigration. Despite Salvini's hard-line stance, migrants are continuing to arrive, even if not in the same numbers as during the period between 2014 and 2017.

At the heart of the meeting in Vienna is Iran's desire for European countries to deliver on promises of financial relief from US sanctions. Iran is insisting that it wants to save the agreement and has urged the Europeans to start buying Iranian oil or give Iran a credit line to keep the accord alive. The regular quarterly meeting of the accord's so-called joint commission, which brings together senior officials from Iran, France, Germany, Britain, Russia, China and the European Union, is meant to discuss implementation of the deal. The 2015 agreement aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions in exchange for relief from economic sanctions. The United States withdrew from the accord last year and has imposed new sanctions on Iran to cripple its economy, in hopes of forcing Tehran into negotiating a wider-ranging deal. US President Donald Trump said on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Japan that ""there's no rush"" to ease the tensions with Iran. ""There's absolutely no time pressure,"" he added. ""I think that in the end, hopefully, it's going to work out. If it does, great. And if doesn't, you'll be hearing about it."" Iran recently quadrupled its production of low-enriched uranium. It previously said it would surpass a 300-kilogram stockpile limit set by the accord by Thursday, but an Iranian official said that it was 2.8 kilograms below that limit Wednesday and there would be no new assessment until ""after the weekend."" It is currently a holiday weekend in Iran. European countries are pressing for Iran to comply in full with the accord, though they have not specified what the consequences would be of failing to do so. But Iranian officials maintain that even if it surpasses the limit, it would not be breaching the deal, and say such a move could be reversed quickly. The Europeans also face a July 7 deadline set by Tehran to offer long-promised relief from US sanctions, or Iran says it will also begin enriching its uranium closer to weapons-grade levels. On Thursday, Iranian state television reported that foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif sent a letter urging European signatories to the accord to implement their commitments, saying Iran's next steps depend on that. Britain, France and Germany are finalizing a complicated barter-type system known as INSTEX to maintain trade with Iran and avoid US sanctions, as part of efforts to keep the nuclear deal afloat. It would help ensure trade between Iran and Europe by allowing buyers and sellers to exchange money without relying on the usual cross-border financial transactions. Tensions have been rising in the Middle East. Citing unspecified Iranian threats, the US has sent an aircraft carrier to the region and deployed additional troops alongside the tens of thousands already there. The US has been worried about international shipping through the Strait of Hormuz since tankers were damaged in May and June in what Washington has blamed on limpet mines from Iran, although Tehran denies any involvement. Last week, Iran shot down a US Navy surveillance drone, saying it violated its territory; Washington said it was in international airspace. On Thursday, US Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook met with top European diplomats in Paris. He told The Associated Press that he wants them to get tougher on Iran, instead of clinging to the nuclear deal. War with Iran is ""not necessary,"" Hook said. ""We are not looking for any conflict in the region,"" he said. But if the US is attacked, ""we will respond with military force."" The U.S. is trying to drum up support for an international naval force in the Persian Gulf, notably to protect shipping. German Chancellor Angela Merkel met Trump Friday on the sidelines of the G-20 summit. She said they discussed Iran ""and the question of how we can get into a negotiating process, which I advocated very strongly."" Chinese President Xi Jinping, also attending the summit, said that the Gulf region stands ""at a crossroads of war and peace,"" news agency Xinhua and state broadcaster CCTV reported. ""China always stands on the side of peace and opposes war,"" Xi said, calling on all sides to remain calm, exercise restraint and promote dialogue. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the world can't afford a conflict. He said it was ""essential to de-escalate the situation"" and avoid confrontation.

""We reject the unilateral imposition of sanctions,"" said Fu Cong, director general of the Chinese foreign ministry's department of arms control. The United States, which is trying to force Iran to renegotiate an agreement limiting its nuclear programme, at the end of May tightened sanctions to include a full ban on Iran's exports of oil and has threatened to punish nations which refuse to go along. ""For us energy security is important and the importation of oil is important to Chinese energy security and also to the livelihood of the people,"" said Cong. The sanctions have led to a plunge in Iranian oil exports, a key source of revenue for the government. But according to an International Energy Agency report earlier this month Iran was continuing to export some oil, although it was difficult to say to which countries the crude was being shipped. ""We do not accept this so-called zero policy of the United States,"" said Cong, who was speaking on the sidelines of a meeting on the implementation of the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal. The deal with European powers, Russia and the United States relaxed trade restrictions on Iran in exchange for limits on its nuclear programme, but President Donald Trump has pulled Washington out of the agreement.

The record was set in the village of Villevieille in the southern department of Gard, which registered a high of 45.1 degrees Celsius. The previous record stood at 44.1 degrees Celsius in the same area during the notorious August 2003 heatwave, Meteo-France told AFP. The centre of Carpentras was almost deserted in the middle of the day, with cafe owners contemplating empty terraces which usually would be packed. ""We have never seen this!"" one exclaimed. At least two deaths linked to the heatwave were reported in Spain. After feeling dizzy while helping harvest wheat in the southern Andalusia region, a Spanish teenager collapsed with convulsions when he took a dip in a swimming pool to cool off. He was rushed to hospital in the town of Cordoba where he later died, the regional government said. Elsewhere in Spain, a 93-year-old man collapsed and died on the street in the northern city of Valladolid, police said, giving heatstroke as the cause of death. Heat-related deaths have also been reported in Italy, France and Germany, mainly among the elderly. France remains haunted by the memory of the devastating heatwave of August 2003 which exposed the shortcomings of emergency services at the height of the summer holidays. That year, nearly 15,000 people are estimated to have died because of the heat, many of them elderly people at home. ""I want to appeal to the sense of responsibility of citizens -- there are avoidable deaths in every heatwave,"" said French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe. In Montpellier, 81-year-old Suzette Allegre was up early to do her shopping. By 8:00 am, ""the sun is already burning hot and you can smell the pollution,"" she told AFP, saying she was rushing home to barricade herself indoors. Scientists warn that global warming linked to human fossil fuel use could make such scorchers more frequent. French Health Minister Agnes Buzyn warned those tempted to plunge into cold water, both young and old, to do so only in designated public bathing areas, adding that four people had drowned since the beginning of the week. On Thursday, Buzyn complained that despite a barrage of public health warnings on radio, TV and on public transport, some parents were still leaving their children in hot cars and joggers were out exercising in the midday heat. Also Thursday, a six-year-old Syrian child was seriously injured in the Saint-Denis neighbourhood north of Paris after being catapulted into the air by water gushing from an open fire hydrant and then crashing to the ground. In the Italian city of Milan, a 72-year-old homeless man was found dead at the main train station on Thursday after falling ill due to the heatwave. A day earlier, at least four people died in Germany in bathing accidents. In Spain, firefighters were continuing to battle a large forest fire in the northeastern Catalonia region. Catalonia's forest service said the fire likely began when an ""improperly managed"" pile of manure at a chicken farm spontaneously combusted in the extreme heat. Hundreds of firefighters backed by troops and aerial water bombers were trying to bring it under control. They were hampered by roasting 44-degree temperatures and very low humidity according to David Borrell, head of the Catalan fire department. Spain's north-east was on red heatwave alert denoting ""extreme risk"". The stifling temperatures have caused air quality to nosedive in some European cities, prompting local authorities to take anti-pollution measures. In Paris, Lyon and Marseille, authorities have banned the most polluting cars from the roads in recent days.

The comments came as May met Putin on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Japan's Osaka, their first formal face-to-face since the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal last year. ""She told the president that there cannot be a normalisation of our bilateral relationship until Russia stops the irresponsible and destabilising activity that threatens the UK and its allies - including hostile interventions in other countries, disinformation and cyber attacks,"" the spokesperson said. May also told Putin that Britain ""has irrefutable evidence that Russia was behind the attack"" on the former spy. ""The prime minister underlined that we remain open to a different relationship, but for that to happen the Russian government must choose a different path."" London has made clear that May's meeting with Putin does not represent a thawing of ties with Russia, despite calls from Putin for the two countries to ""turn the page"". Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Russian president and May first met one-on-one, accompanied only by their translators. ""In this format May spoke about the Skripal affair, she raised this issue and got necessary answers from the Russian president,"" Peskov told reporters on a conference call. They later discussed trade and economic ties with members of their delegations, he said. Peskov said ""there is an understanding"" of the need to revive bilateral economic cooperation ""in the interests of the two countries' business."" The two leaders also discussed the Ukraine, Syria and Iran crises, he added. Ties between Moscow and London have been severely strained since the March 2018 poisoning of the former Russian spy and double agent Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the English city of Salisbury. The incident led to dozens of tit-for-tat diplomatic expulsions and a breakdown in already fragile relations between Moscow and London. Russia has repeatedly denied any part in his killing. Earlier this month, Putin said it was time to ""turn the page"" on the countries' difficult relationship after the poisoning. ""Global issues related to national interests in the economic and social spheres and global security are more important than games of security services,"" the Kremlin leader said at the time. Skripal sold secrets to Britain and moved there after a 2010 spy swap. Last year, he and his daughter were poisoned with a military-grade nerve agent, the first use of chemical weapons in Europe since World War II. London says the attempted assassination was ""almost certainly"" approved by the Russian state. The G20 will be one of May's last trips as prime minister as Britain awaits a new leader. Former foreign minister and London mayor Boris Johnson is the favourite to succeed her in an election that will be decided in a vote by members of the ruling Conservative party. The winner will be announced on July 23, and will formally take office the next day. Putin has voiced hope relations could improve under a new PM.

The EU said in a statement on Thursday that Sri Lanka's planned executions will send the wrong signals to the international community and investors. It said it will monitor Sri Lanka's commitments to international conventions upon which hinges a preferential trade deal with the country. Sri Lanka has a lucrative market access to the EU through the generalized scheme of preferences plus. The concessions were withdrawn over alleged abuses immediately after a long civil war, which ended in 2009. President Maithripala Sirisena's government took steps toward reforms and commitments on human rights to secure the program back on being elected to office in 2015. But Sirisena said this week he had signed the death warrants for four drug convicts and they would be executed soon. Sirisena told a school function on Friday that he had decided to resume executions to save the youth from narcotics and that he has explained his position to UN chief Antonio Gutteres during a telephone conversation on Thursday night. Sri Lanka last executed a prisoner in 1976. ""The death penalty is a cruel, inhuman and a degrading punishment, and the EU unequivocally opposes its use in all circumstances and all cases,"" the EU statement said. ""While the Sri Lankan authorities have cited the need to address drug-related offences, studies show that the death penalty fails to act as a deterrent to crime."" Sri Lanka has been grappling with drug-related crimes for years and is believed to be used by the peddlers as a transit hub. In April, police publicly destroyed 770 kilograms (1,695 pounds) of drugs seized in 2016 and 2017. Police have seized 731 kilograms (1,608 pounds) of heroin, 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) of cocaine and 1,607 kilograms (3,535 pounds) of marijuana so far this year.

"69992494"|"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/lawsuit-seeks-to-block-georgia-law-that-bans-most-abortions/articleshow/69992494.cms"|"[AP]"|"ATLANTA: A federal lawsuit filed Friday in Atlanta is the latest effort by abortion providers and advocacy groups to challenge a wave of restrictive abortion laws passed in conservative states. Lawyers with the American Civil Liberties Union, Planned Parenthood and the Center for Reproductive Rights filed the lawsuit challenging a new Georgia law that effectively bans abortions about six weeks into a pregnancy. The lawsuit, filed on behalf of Georgia abortion providers and advocacy groups, asks a judge to prevent the law from taking effect and to declare it unconstitutional. If it's not blocked, the law is set to take effect Jan. 1. ""The U.S. Supreme Court has clearly held that a woman has the freedom to make one of the most intimate decisions that she can make,'' ACLU of Georgia legal director Sean Young said. The so-called heartbeat law bans abortion once a fetal heartbeat can be detected, which can occur as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, before many women know they're pregnant. It is one of a spate of laws passed recently by Republican-controlled legislatures in an attack on the US Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that said a woman has the right to choose whether to have an abortion. The legislation makes exceptions in the case of rape and incest, if the woman files a police report first. It also allows for abortions when the life of the woman is at risk or when a fetus is determined not to be viable because of a serious medical condition. It also declares an embryo or fetus a ""natural person'' once cardiac activity can be detected, saying that is the point where ""the full value of a child begins.'' That would make the fetus a dependent minor for tax purposes and trigger child support obligations. ``This law is an affront to the dignity and health of Georgians,'' the lawsuit says. ``It is in particular an attack on low-income Georgians, Georgians of color, and rural Georgians, who are least able to access medical care and least able to overcome the cruelties of this law.'' The lawsuit was filed against Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, Attorney General Chris Carr, state health officials and six district attorneys whose jurisdictions include the areas where the abortion providers who brought the suit practice. Kemp's office declined to comment Friday, referring requests for comment to Carr's office. Kemp acknowledged when he signed the law in May that a court challenge was likely. But he said then that he was undeterred. ""I realize that some may challenge it in the court of law,'' Kemp said at the time. ""We will not back down. We will always continue to fight for life.'' A spokeswoman for Carr did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. But in response to a letter in April from Democratic state Sen. Jen Jordan asking Carr for his opinion on the law's constitutionality citing ""the possibility of substantial legal fees,'' Carr's office said it was his duty to defend state laws and that the office generally doesn't comment on the constitutionality of state statutes. Women choose to have abortions ``for a variety of deeply personal reasons'' that include family circumstances, medical concerns and financial situation, the lawsuit says. If the law takes effect, some women who are able will travel out of state for the procedure, but other women will remain pregnant and give birth against their will or will seek to end their pregnancies outside of a clinical setting putting them at risk for harm, the lawsuit says. The law could also have a chilling effect on health care providers in the state as its ``vague language threatens clinicians with prosecution for any medical care they provide to pregnant patients that could harm an embryo/fetus,'' the lawsuit says. The new definition of a fetus as a ""natural person'' appears to apply throughout the Georgia code with implications that are ``vague and potentially vast,'' the lawsuit says. Louisiana , Kentucky , Mississippi and Ohio have passed similar bills barring abortion once there's a detectable fetal heartbeat. Missouri's governor signed a bill approving an eight-week ban on abortion, with exceptions only for medical emergencies. A new Alabama law bans virtually all abortions, even in cases of rape or incest, and makes performing an abortion at any stage of pregnancy a felony punishable by 10 to 99 years or life in prison for the provider. None of the bans has taken effect and all are expected to be blocked by the courts while legal challenges move forward.

"69993580"|"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-harris-and-tulsi-gabbard-made-impact-during-dem-debate-as-trump-torches-it-as-boring/articleshow/69993580.cms"|"[Chidanand Rajghatta, TNN]"|"WASHINGTON: Senator Kamala Harris and Congresswomen Tulsi Gabbard, two White House aspirants with strong India connections in a crowded field of more than 20 Democratic candidates, gained most traction and garnered most attention in two days of debates aimed at assessing potential challengers to Donald Trump in the 2020 Presidential elections. Tulsi Gabbard, a fourth-term lawmaker from Hawaii and self-professed Hindu-American, stole the show in the first debate on Wednesday night featuring ten Democratic White House aspirants. Nearly 40 per cent voters named her the winner in a Drudge Report poll, pushing Elizabeth Warren to second place with 12 per cent, while Google Trends showed she was the most-searched candidate during the debate. In the second debate on Thursday night, pundits declared California Senator Kamala Harris, whose Tamilian mother Shyamala Gopalan immigrated from Chennai, a clear winner after she torched a strong field that included former vice-president and front-runner Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, among others. The fact that Harris and Gabbard eclipsed Biden and Sanders, who are both considered front runners of the pack out to win the Democratic nomination to challenge Trump, suggested American voters, particularly young millennials, may be tiring of old white men who continue to dominate US politics despite the profound demographic changes in America. In deference to the changes, at least three candidates Bete O’Rourke, Cory Booker, and Pete Buttegieg reverted to Spanish in response to some questions. But more broadly, women seemed to win more acclaim than men in the debate with Senator Elizabeth Warren too earning praise for her detailed policy prescriptions reflecting the leftward tilt of the party under pressure from young rank and file. However, it was Kamala Harris’ decimation of “Uncle Joe” on Thursday night that made headlines, with one pundit declaring she had won the debate with “prosecutorial zeal” and “her forensic destruction of Joe Biden may prove to be a game changer.” The pivotal moment came when Harris schooled Biden on racism in America amid a raging controversy about the former vice-president and seven-term Senator’s contention that he could work with segregationist colleagues in more congenial times in the Senate, which has sometimes been referred to as the “oldest white boys network in the world.” “I do not believe you are a racist and I agree with you when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground. But I also believe — and it’s personal, it was hurtful — to hear you talk about two United States senators who built their reputations and careers on the segregation of race in this country. It was not only that; you also worked with them to oppose bussing,” Harris charged, as she torched Biden’s conviviality with racist Senators amid an argument over bussing, an arrangement to overcome segregation in schools by transporting all children together. “There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bussed to school every day. That little girl was me, ” Harris added, referring to herself as the “only black person on stage.” Even as Biden protested that she was mischaracterizing his stand and he has strong anti-racist credentials, Harris would go on to school the panel amid loud crosstalk during the debate, telling them, “Hey guys… America does not want to witness a foodfight…they want to know how we can put food on the table.” While her punchlines drew the loudest applause, the two-day Democratic debate was notable for detailed policy discussions on issues such as healthcare and education. But in distant Japan, President Trump could not seem to take his eyes off the debate even though he had declared it “boring” as he headed out to the G-20 summit. “I am in Japan at the G-20, representing our Country well, but I heard it was not a good day for Sleepy Joe or Crazy Bernie. One is exhausted, the other is nuts - so what’s the big deal?” Trump tweeted, after telling German Chancellor Angela Merkel that he would rather be talking to her than watch the debate. There were more observations on his Twitter feed on the Democratic debate than on the G-20 summit, including sneering asides about a technical glitch on NBC, the broadcast network at briefly interrupted the debate. “Truly unprofessional and only worthy of a FAKE NEWS Organization, which they are!” Trump gibed.

Joe Biden, vice president under still highly popular ex-president Barack Obama, came in as the frontrunner but the 76-year-old stumbled when attacked by younger rivals in the second of two televised debates in Miami, each featuring 10 candidates. As the only black woman in the 2020 race, Harris already stands out, but she stole the show by attacking Biden's record on race relations, leaving him literally speechless. Harris, a senator and former attorney general of California, pinned down Biden on his past opposition to school busing programs that forced integration of segregated school systems in the 1970s -- and Biden faltered. ""My time is up,"" he finally said. Although he'd meant that he had run out of the few seconds granted by moderators on the crowded debate stage, his words went viral on Twitter as a symbolic admission that he is a man of yesteryear in a party demanding radical change. The radical spirit was on full display both Thursday and in the first debate Wednesday, showing the barriers facing a centrist like Biden on the way to the nomination. Harris and popular self-described socialist Bernie Sanders joined lesser players in supporting, to various degrees, free healthcare for all, forgiving of student debt, restrictions on private firearms, and an end to Trump's tough crackdown against illegal immigration. At Wednesday's debate, leftist Senator Elizabeth Warren led the same charge. While these issues are at the heart of what most agree are the deepest problems in the United States, they are also notorious ideological minefields and never have so many presidential candidates offered such uncompromising solutions. Trump, on the other side of the world at the Japan G20 summit, gloated. ""All Democrats just raised their hands for giving millions of illegal aliens unlimited healthcare. How about taking care of American Citizens first!?"" he tweeted. ""That's the end of that race!"" It's too early to say whether Biden, an affable, but gaffe-prone figure, will see his big polling lead melt away. Trump certainly thinks so. ""Not a good day for Sleepy Joe or Crazy Bernie. One is exhausted, the other is nuts,"" Trump summarized with his characteristic insults on Twitter. But the rough treatment, which also included Sanders recalling that Biden had voted for going to war in Iraq, could instead harden the former VP ahead of what will be a brutal battle with Trump. ""While Biden didn't soar, we doubt he was fatally damaged by any of this,"" veteran politics watcher Larry Sabato said in his post-game analysis. ""Nonetheless, as frontrunner, Biden can look forward to many more attacks. Whether this sharpens Biden for the campaign against Trump (should he win the nomination) or deconstructs Biden on his way to losing the Democratic nod, we cannot guess."" Despite an impressive resume and compelling personal story as a black woman who rose to the top, Harris, 54, has struggled to gain traction in a field dominated by two elderly white men -- Biden and Sanders -- and also featuring the intense Warren. Thursday night, she broke free. In what could only have been a carefully rehearsed attack, drawing on all her experience as a courtroom prosecutor, she first disarmed Biden by saying she was sure he was no racist. But then she began to question his history on the fraught issue, cornering him with the point that he'd once opposed busing. In fact, busing was hugely controversial and not all opposition was motivated by wanting racial segregation. But Harris, her voice quivering with emotion, had an ambush to complete. ""There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools and she was bused to school every day,"" she said to the hushed audience -- and to Biden. ""That little girl was me."" While the Florida debate was still going, the Harris campaign tweeted out that killer line with a picture of Harris as a schoolgirl in pigtails. A T-shirt bearing the same image went on sale immediately after. So many Democrats are struggling to take on Trump that they are likely to fight each other for a long time first. At the first debate on Wednesday, Trump's name was hardly mentioned. That changed on Thursday, with candidates rounding on Trump's criminalization of illegal immigrants, and what they said were his policies favoring the rich over the middle classes -- even if Trump boasts that the roaring US economy benefits all Americans. ""Trump is a pathological liar and a racist,"" Sanders blasted. Harris called Trump ""the greatest national security threat to the United States"" because of his rejection of warnings that the climate is in the midst of disastrous change. Biden, seeking a recovery in his closing remarks, called for restoration of ""the ""soul"" of the country after Trump ""ripped it out."" ""We have got to unite the United States of America,"" he said.

""I'm heading to Japan, Osaka. And we are going to be meeting with (leaders from) a lot of different countries, many of whom have been taking advantage of the United States but not so much anymore, and soon not at all anymore,"" Trump told reporters in the South lawns of the White House before boarding Marine One which took him to Andrews Joint Air Force Base for Air Force One for travelling to Japan. Besides Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the US president will meet his Chinese and Russian counterparts Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the G-20 Summit. The White House said Trump and Modi would hold a bilateral meeting on June 28. This would be the third engagement of Trump on Friday, which would start with his meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at 8.30 am local time. Thereafter, Modi would join Abe and Trump for a tri-lateral meeting at 9.15 am. The Trump-Modi bilateral is scheduled to start at 9.35 am. Trump's next engagement is with German Chancellor Angel Merkel at 10.15 am, according to the White House. He will also meet the Russian and Brazilian presidents later in the afternoon. This would be Trump's first meeting with Modi after his recent electoral victory. It comes in the immediate aftermath of the India visit of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, during which he met Modi, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval. The Trump-Modi meeting assumes significance in the wake of the strain that has popped up in the bilateral relationship on a host of trade and economic issues. In his brief interaction with the media on the South Lawns of the White House, Trump did not mention India. ""I'm meeting with (leaders of) many countries. We're meeting with many countries, we have many things. We've been ripped off by everybody over the years. They're not ripping us off anymore. A big difference right now,"" he said. ""We're meeting with China, just so you know, China has been paying us billions and billions of dollars. Until I got here, they never paid this country 10 cents. So, we'll see what happens with China, with Russia, with Japan, with many countries,"" Trump said. Earlier during an interview with Fox news, Trump emphasized on bilateral trade agreements with other countries. This is Trump's second visit to Japan in less than a month. The G20 is an opportunity for world leaders to discuss the biggest challenges facing the global economy, the White House said. Trump's goal this week is to fight for the best deals and outcomes possible to lift up America's workers, it said. A truly level-playing field means breaking down foreign barriers -- both the tariff and non-tariff kind -- that have stifled America's economy and taken away too many jobs, the White House said. ""Unlike his predecessors, Trump is willing to use every tool at his disposal to bring these countries to the negotiating table and agree to better terms for our citizens,” it said. “We are a country that's respected again,” Trump said before boarding Marine One Wednesday afternoon.

Starting Thursday, tweets that Twitter deems to involve matters of public interest, but which violate the service's rules, will be obscured by a warning explaining the violation and Twitter's reasons for publishing it anyway.

Twitter said the new policy applies to all government officials, candidates, and similar public figures with more than 100,000 followers. The new stance could fuel additional Trumpian ire toward social media. The president routinely complains, without evidence, that social media sites are biased against him and other conservatives. Twitter's rules prohibit threatening violence against a person or group, engaging in ``targeted harassment of someone,'' or inciting others to do so, such as wishing a person is harmed. It prohibits hate speech against a group based on race, ethnicity, gender or other categories, and disallows the threatening or promoting of terrorism. The company has long exempted public figures from many of its usual rules, contending that publishing controversial tweets from politicians encourages discussion and helps hold leaders accountable . But there have been longstanding calls to remove Trump from the service for what activists and others have said is abusive and threatening behavior. This week, for example, the president posted that an attack by Iran ``will be met with great and overwhelming force. In some areas, overwhelming will mean obliteration.'' Trump has used Twitter to attack his enemies, issuing many tweets that may violate these policies, including calling a former staffer a ``lowlife'' and ``dog,'' tweeting a video of himself beating up a man with a CNN logo replacing his head, and retweeting seemingly faked, inflammatory anti-Muslim videos. Twitter's new policy doesn't apply to past tweets. Twitter said it is still possible for a government official or other figure to tweet something so egregious that it warrants removal. A direct threat of violence against an individual, for instance, would qualify. The company said warning-label decisions will be made by a group that includes members of its trust and safety, legal and public policy teams, as well as employees in the regions where particular tweets originate. When a tweet gets such a notice placed on it, Twitter said it will not appear in the site's ``safe search'' mode, notifications tab, the explore section and other places Twitter promotes or highlights tweets.

The court threw out the case lodged by ex-general Prabowo Subianto, saying he did not prove he lost the April vote because of widespread cheating and voter fraud, allegations that sparked deadly rioting in Jakarta. ""The plaintiff's case is legally groundless,"" said chief Justice Anwar Usman. ""We reject (his) demand in its entirety."" In the course of a hearing that stretched over nine hours, the panel painstakingly described many of the allegations — including vote buying and that biased civil servants favoured Widodo — as baseless. The court, which also questioned the quality of the evidence and the credibility of witnesses, said voter-fraud claims were the responsibility of Indonesia's elections supervisory agency and beyond its remit. Subianto claimed that the election in the world's third-biggest democracy was plagued by ""systematic, structured and massive"" electoral fraud that cost him victory. His lawyers sought to overturn the official results that declared Widodo the winner with 55.5 per cent of votes, against Subianto's 44.5 per cent. After the ruling, Subianto said he would consider his options. ""This ruling is very disappointing for us and our supporters but as has been agreed we will comply with and follow the constitution,"" he said in a televised address. ""I will consult with my legal team,"" he added. Subianto, who lost a similar court battle in 2014 when Widodo defeated him, has little recourse, according to constitutional law expert Refly Harun. ""If the claim is rejected then it's game over"" for Subianto, he said before the court's ruling. Subianto supporter Daeng Wahidin was among a few thousand people gathered outside the court for the verdict, but police barricades prevented them getting near the building. ""The state can make its decision, but I won't accept Jokowi as president,"" the 45-year-old Wahidin told AFP, referring to Widodo by his nickname. ""I think he was elected through a fraudulent system."" Some 47,000 police and army personnel were deployed around the court and other parts of central Jakarta amid fears of more unrest, but there was little sign of violent demonstrations. Last month, peaceful protests against the official result by Subianto supporters erupted into two nights of street battles between police and rioters, leaving nine people dead and hundreds injured in the capital's worst violence in years. Indonesian police have been in the spotlight after videos surfaced that appeared to show officers beating protesters. There are also questions about how the demonstrators — including a 15-year-old high school student — died. This week, Amnesty International called for an independent probe into what it called ""grave human rights violations"" by police against protesters — including beatings and ""torture"" — and allegations that they were behind the killings of demonstrators. Some of the dead were reported to have gunshot wounds. Police have insisted they did not shoot live rounds, but instead used rubber bullets, water cannon and tear gas to push back the crowds. Meanwhile, several Subianto allies have recently been arrested, including former army general Kivlan Zen over his alleged links to the Jakarta riots. Police have also aired video from several arrested suspects who claimed that Zen masterminded a failed plot to sow chaos by killing four senior government officials, including its chief security minister and the president's top intelligence adviser.

In his opinion, Court of Justice Advocate General Evgeni Tanchev said the Disciplinary Chamber of Poland's Supreme Court ""does not satisfy the requirements of judicial independence under EU laws.'' The disciplinary body, created by the ruling Law and Justice party, was given the power to discipline judges over their conduct and rulings. Chamber members are chosen by the National Council for the Judiciary, which had its appointment process changed so politicians pick the members. Tanchev argued the National Council for the Judiciary does not appear to be free from political influence. The opinion was the second challenge this week to an overhaul of Poland's judicial system that gives the government more control of the courts. The changes to the judicial system have raised concerns at the EU over rule of law in Poland. The European Court of Justice ruled Monday that the law that pushed Supreme Court judges into early retirement violates EU law EU legal advisers' opinions are not binding, but the Court of Justice follows their advice in most cases, though not in all. Polish Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro sharply criticized the advocate general's opinion, arguing it overstepped the EU's mandate and intruded on Poland's sovereignty. He also said he did not believe the Court of Justice would ultimately rule in line with the advocate general's opinion. ""It boils down to a defense of pathology,'' Ziobro said. Both EU court developments were welcomed by those in Poland who fear changes to the judicial system promoted by the right-wing ruling party, Law and Justice, have eroded judicial independence and the country's democratic culture more generally. Krystian Markiewicz, president of an association of Polish judges, Iustitia, called Tanchev's opinion ""crushing for the so-called reforms of Law and Justice'' and in his view revealed ``their hypocrisy and the aim of politicizing the courts.''

"69976627"|"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/europe-powerless-as-iran-nuclear-deal-unravels/articleshow/69976627.cms"|"[AFP]"|"PARIS: The 2015 Iranian nuclear deal, hailed at the time as a historic boost for regional peace, is unravelling before the eyes of its European backers who appear powerless in the face of US rejection of the accord, analysts say. The United States, under the presidency of Barack Obama, was among the powers that clinched the deal. But in May 2018, Donald Trump declared he was abandoning the signature foreign policy achievement of his predecessor. European powers led by Germany and France have sought to salvage the deal but analysts say the accord appears all but doomed as the risk of military confrontation between Tehran and Washington grows. Frustrated it was not getting the promised benefits of the deal following the US withdrawal, Iran last month said it would stop respecting the agreed limits on stockpiles of enriched uranium as well as those for heavy water. ""Everything was sealed after the decision by Donald Trump,"" Bruno Tertrais, deputy director of France's Foundation for Strategic Research (FRS), told AFP. The 2015 accord promised Iran relief from international sanctions that had crippled its economy for years, in return for guarantees about the peaceful nature of its nuclear programme which Western powers fear could be used to make a bomb. The problem is that the global economy is so connected it is near impossible for European companies to deal seriously with Iran without incurring the wrath of the United States, analysts say. EU companies are still haunted by the $8.9-billion fine handed to French bank BNP Paribas in June 2014 after it pled guilty to US criminal charges of violating sanctions on Cuba, Iran and Sudan for eight years. ""European companies are more globalised while the US policy under Trump is without any concession,"" said Tertrais. EU officials have insisted the deal is not dead and have engaged in intense diplomacy with Tehran, despite an upsurge of tensions in the Gulf following the sabotage of tankers the US has blamed on Iran. President Emmanuel Macron's diplomatic advisor Emmanuel Bonne and German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas have both visited Tehran this month. EU powers have sought to keep the nuclear deal alive with a special trade mechanism called INSTEX that would allow legitimate trade with Iran without falling foul of US sanctions. But it is not fully operational. ""I would not say the deal is dead yet, but certainly it is in intensive care,"" said Annalisa Perteghella, research fellow at the Italian Institute for International Political Studies (ISPI). ""We are witnessing some efforts to resuscitate it but if I look at the future, I can't see it leaving the hospital safe and sound,"" she added. She said instruments such as INSTEX promoted by the European Union to revive the deal have ""proven worthless in the face of the tremendous economic leverage the US still has on financial markets"". Even if key EU powers such as Germany were not sympathetic to Trump, they would in no way risk their own companies' exports to the United States for the sake of standing up to Washington, she said. In order to sway Trump, ""you have a credible instrument for retaliation, and the EU, as of today, simply lacks it,"" she said. Rakesh Sood, a former Indian ambassador and now distinguished fellow at the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation (ORF), said the nuclear deal was a test to see if the EU can be a serious political player with a credible foreign policy. ""So far the record has been poor and all it has is an anaemic INSTEX to show for it,"" he said. A diplomatic source in Vienna, the headquarters of the UN atomic agency, said Iran would not exceed on Thursday the uranium stockpile limit agreed in the deal, despite Tehran previously giving June 27 as the date. The source said there might be a ""political reason"" for this, given intensified efforts by European governments in recent days. But while EU powers battle to show there is still life in the deal, scepticism is growing over whether it is just to keep up appearances. ""Saying that we are going to keep the deal is right in principle but in reality, we cannot,"" former French foreign minister Hubert Vedrine told RFI radio.

They chanted: ""Freedom, peace, and justice. Civilian (rule) is the people's choice."" Demonstrations in Khartoum have become rare since security forces broke up a sit-in outside the Defence Ministry on June 3, leaving more than 100 people dead, according to medical sources. The sit-in had become the focal point of protests against former president Omar al-Bashir and the military council that ousted him on April 11. Its dispersal caused the collapse of stalled talks between the military council and a coalition of opposition and protest groups over how to manage a transition towards elections. Mediators led by Ethiopia's prime minister and the African Union have since been trying to broker a return to direct talks between the two sides. Activists who led months of protests against Bashir have called for a million-strong march on Sunday to try to revive street pressure on the military council and call for it to cede power to civilians. Bashir ruled Sudan for nearly 30 years before he was unseated following a deepening economic crisis and 16 weeks of street protests.

""The people of Istanbul have confirmed their attachment to the Republic and to democracy,'' Imamoglu told the jubilant, flag-waving crowd. ""This confirmation has shown the world that Turkey isn't any ordinary Middle Eastern country. The belief in democracy runs deep in Turkey's veins.''

The cancellation had raised concerns about democracy in Turkey, where Erdogan is accused of increasing authoritarianism. In a rebuke to the ruling party, voters returned Imamoglu to the office with 54.21% of the vote _ 806,000 votes more than the governing Justice and Development Party's candidate, former prime minister Binali Yildirim.

The fire could eventually devour 20,000 hectares in what was presented as an ""extreme risk"", a statement said. Some 350 firefighters backed by around 230 soldiers and 15 aerial tanker aircraft were at the scene of the blaze, the worst in Catalonia in 20 years. The fire raged several kilometres from the Asco nuclear plant but officials said the site was not at risk since winds were blowing the flames away from it. ""The difficulties are such that we can't talk about a fire that is under control or in the extinction phase, but rather that we're at a moment when the blaze is getting bigger,"" regional interior minister Miquel Buch told Catalan radio. Buch said it might have been caused by ""an accumulation of manure in a farm that generated enough heat to explode and generate sparks.""

The 48-year-old, who has been lodged at Wandsworth prison in south-west London since his arrest in March in connection with the nearly $2 billion Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud and money laundering case, will be appearing for the first time since his bail appeal was rejected by the UK high court earlier this month, his fourth attempt at bail. In her judgment handed down at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, Justice Ingrid Simler concluded there were “substantial grounds” to believe that Modi would fail to surrender as he does possess the means to “abscond”. Reiterating similar concerns as those previously raised by Westminster Magistrates' Court during earlier bail attempts, Judge Simler ruled that after considering all the material “carefully”, she had found strong evidence to suggest there had been interference with witnesses and destruction of evidence in the case and concluded it can still occur. ""The applicant has access to considerable financial resources, supported by an increased (bail bond security) offer of 2 million pounds,” the judge noted. The high court judge stressed that while it was not for her to take a ""definitive view"" on the evidence, she had proceeded on the basis that the government of India has acted in good faith in what is “undoubtedly” a serious case and a “sophisticated international conspiracy” to defraud, together with money laundering. Modi, who has remained in judicial custody since his arrest in March, had the automatic right to file an application in the higher court and did not require permission to appeal. Meanwhile, the first case management hearing in his extradition case took place at Westminster Magistrates' Court on May 30, when Judge Emma Arbuthnot directed the Indian government to confirm which prison Modi is to be held in if he were to be extradited to India, setting a 14-day deadline for a confirmation of the prison plans in India. The UK's Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), representing the Indian government, has until July 11 to present an opening position statement laying out the prima facie case against Modi, with the next case management hearing set for July 29 – when a timeline for extradition trial is expected to be laid out. Modi was arrested by uniformed Scotland Yard officers on an extradition warrant on March 19 and has been in prison since. During subsequent hearings, Westminster Magistrates' Court was told that Modi was the ""principal beneficiary"" of the fraudulent issuance of letters of undertaking (LoUs) as part of a conspiracy to defraud PNB and then laundering the proceeds of crime. Under UK law, Modi is expected to be produced before the court every four weeks, with another remand hearing expected before the July 29 case management hearing currently fixed in the court's calendar.

Judging by his time as foreign secretary, possibly both. When Johnson was given the foreign job in 2016, after Britain voted to leave the EU, he was viewed as an unlikely choice by politicians and public alike given his tendency to court controversy with gaffes, oddball jokes and off-the-cuff remarks. The early days seemed to confirm the worst fears of those who saw the Conservative lawmaker as an unsuitable diplomat, at a critical time when Britain needed to forge new political and commercial ties with a slew of countries. What should have been a routine conference in Italy, the “Mediterranean Dialogues Forum” aimed at building relations with leading envoys from the West and Middle East, instead turned into something of a diplomatic incident. Johnson made headlines by going off-script and accusing Saudi Arabia, an important regional ally, of acting as a puppeteer in proxy wars under the guise of religion. The backlash was swift from Prime Minister Theresa May, who said his comments did not reflect “actual policy”, dishing out what a government source described as a shocking and very public “cuffing” for a senior minister. Now May is stepping down over her failure to extract Britain from the European Union. Johnson, a leader of the Brexit campaign, is the overwhelming favourite to become leader of the governing Conservative Party next month, which would also make him prime minister. The 55-year-old, famous for his messy mop of blond hair and dishevelled style, has turned upper-class English eccentricity into a political asset in Britain and perfected a personal brand based on a comic talent and a seemingly shambolic style. His critics say this robs him of statesman-like gravity, arguing that it’s difficult to take seriously a man who once said the chance of him becoming prime minister was about as likely as finding Elvis on Mars. However two of Johnson’s aides and another veteran Conservative who knows him said that he was often misunderstood and that beneath his blustering, self-confident demeanour was a shy, serious man focussed on his goals. He is a natural introvert, two sources close his team told Reuters, adding that his shyness is often construed as arrogance, and he needs a lot of time alone before speaking in public - distinctively at odds with the public perception of Johnson being a natural, unscripted showman. “Before speaking to a room, he needs to corral himself,” said the veteran Conservative. “It’s not a performance but it saps him of energy. He just needs to summon up the energy.” One aide, a government source and an EU diplomat also pointed to an influential, but behind-the-scenes, role he played as foreign secretary following the poisoning of a former Russian spy, Sergei Skripal, by a nerve agent last year in England. One government source said Johnson had put his “shoulder to the wheel” to win international support for sanctions and Russian diplomatic expulsions from a long list of countries. A senior European diplomat agreed that he was “professional” in this role, which attracted little publicity. “People in Brussels didn’t take Boris seriously back then,” the diplomat said. “In March last year, he showed he could drop the clownish personality, he showed a will to discuss the Skripal affair in the most serious terms and to make the point to his counterparts that they needed to back Britain on this.” IRREVERENT INSURGENT Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, to give his full name, is something of an enigma at home and abroad. He is man of apparent contradictions, with his privileged background and bursts of Latin phrases seemingly at odds with his popular appeal when elected mayor of left-leaning London in 2008 with the biggest personal mandate in British history. He is one of those rare politicians to be most commonly referred to by most members of the public by their first names. Like U.S. President Donald Trump, he can emerge unscathed from gaffes and scandals that would sink any normal public figure. Other offensive remarks he has made include calling black people “piccaninnies” and saying Muslim women wearing burkas “look like letter boxes”. “Boris is a flawed character and flaky but most politicians are underneath,” said Ed Costelloe, chair of the campaign group Conservative Grassroots. “It would be lovely to have Mother Theresa as prime minister, but it ain’t going to happen.” In fact, some people love him all the more because he appears to be an irreverent insurgent who defies the media training of polished politics, shooting from the hip with comic timing and flair. Others seem to give him more leeway. After his incendiary comments on Saudi Arabia, for example, two British officials said his words had not in fact gone down badly in Riyadh. “The Saudis appreciated his buffoonery, they understand his kind of humour,” said one of the officials. The biggest task ahead, should he become leader, would be withdrawal talks with the EU, which has said it will not reopen the Withdrawal Agreement agreed by May in November - a deal that was repeatedly rejected by British lawmakers and led to the original Brexit date of March 29 being pushed back. Johnson has offended many in Europe, with remarks such as suggesting Italy should help with a Brexit deal to avoid losing out on sales of Prosecco sparkling wine and declaring it was “bollocks” to say that freedom of movement was a founding principle of the EU. Yet the British government sources said his ability to wrestle changes to the deal from Brussels, as he has demanded, would come down to whether he can carry the support of British lawmakers and end a stalemate that has incensed EU officials. “His success depends on whether the EU believes he can actually command a majority,” said one of the sources. “The thing about the PM was that they just didn’t believe she could ever get it through so were never going to give any more ground. If they think Boris can get it through, they might shift.” IT’S ALL ABOUT BREXIT Johnson has cast himself as the only leadership candidate who can deliver Brexit on the next deadline of Oct. 31 - with or without a deal. The sources close his team said he was approaching his bid in a similarly quiet way to the Skripal manoeuvring. He has built support through behind-the-scenes talks with lawmakers rather through media appearances and speeches - and had been conspicuously absent from public sight until this week. He has been listening closely to the counsel of his closest aides and veteran election strategist Lynton Crosby, who is not officially on the payroll but is offering advice. Johnson’s strategy of steering clear of the airwaves and avoiding public head-to-head debates has been carefully thought through as part of a leadership campaign in the works for months in anticipation of May’s announcement five weeks ago that she would step down, said the sources. The plan appeared uncharacteristic for a man who made his name by being highly visible, including appearing in comedy shows and one of Britain’s best-loved TV soap operas. He even drew accusations from his only remaining leadership rival, Jeremy Hunt, of being a coward for avoiding head-to-head debates. Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd said she found Johnson’s decision to ignore live TV debates “very odd”. The strategy was partly borne of the fact that Johnson is widely viewed as a near-certainty to win the party leadership, and become prime minister, barring an unforeseen catastrophe. Foreign Secretary Hunt voted to stay in the European Union in 2016, which is likely to count against him among the around 160,000 party members who will choose the winner and are mainly pro-Brexit. However Johnson was forced to veer from the gameplan and break cover this week when he was faced with exactly the kind of negative publicity his team had hoped to avoid, after a neighbour called the police upon hearing Johnson and his girlfriend shouting and smashing plates. Police found no cause for action, but the story dominated the front pages of Britain’s newspapers, with some questioning Johnson’s character and past - he is divorcing his second wife and has had several reported affairs. Following the furore, he changed gear and launched into a media blitz on TV and radio. Nonetheless, few in his party believe anything can seriously impede his cruise to 10 Downing Street. “Boris is still well ahead with the membership who will ultimately decide who the next prime minister is,” said Conservative lawmaker and Johnson supporter Andrew Bridgen. “The overriding issue is Brexit and unfortunately Jeremy voted remain.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."|"Genius or joker?

"69979494"|"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-gets-no-commitment-from-nato-for-help-on-iran-threat/articleshow/69979494.cms"|"[AP]"|"BRUSSELS: NATO allies gave the US no firm commitments that they will participate in a global effort to secure international waterways against threats from Iran, acting Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Thursday, wrapping up his first alliance meeting. Esper said the US will come back next month and provide reluctant allies more details on exactly how the Iranian threat has escalated in recent months, and how nations can work together to deter further aggression. ""At the end of the day what our ask is here, near term, is to publicly condemn Iran's bad behavior,'' Esper said as he prepared to leave Brussels. ``And in the meantime, in order to avoid a military escalation, help us maintain the freedom of navigation in the Strait of Hormuz, in the Persian Gulf and wherever.'' Esper, who didn't have high expectations for firm commitments coming in, got little of either, though he said that some allies privately expressed interest in hearing more. Esper's visit to NATO, just days after he took over at the Pentagon, came amid sharply increased tensions between the US and the Islamic Republic. The Trump administration has blamed Iran for recent attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman, as well as bombings in Iraq. Iranian forces also shot down an American drone that it said had flown into its airspace, which the US disputes. Earlier this week, as he headed to NATO, Esper said his goal was to persuade allies that the confrontation with Iran is a global challenge requiring an international response, and that it is ``not Iran versus the United States.'' Esper's discussions with NATO counterparts were aimed at reinforcing the call to action delivered earlier this week by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. US leaders want to build a broad coalition, including Asian and European countries, to counter the Iranian military threat, and help monitor shipping in the Persian Gulf region, where oil tankers have been attacked. NATO allies have expressed reluctance to get involved in any military effort to help secure the region or counter Iran. Europe wants more emphasis on minimizing the chances of war, especially after the events of last week, when President Donald Trump approved military retaliation for Iran's strike against the drone, then withdrew the order at the last minute. Esper said Thursday there is a range of options that allies could participate in, ranging from increased air surveillance and maritime escorts to the establishment of a ``picket line'' of ships to protect the waterways near the Gulf. Those ships would essentially set up a series of checkpoints in the Gulf region. Asked about allies' reaction to the US request, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Thursday that there were no decisions made to take any action. ""Allies agreed that we are deeply concerned about what Iran has done and is doing in the region,'' said Stoltenberg. ""The dialogue between allies will continue, but the main message the main focus of all allies is to de-escalate, is to actually avoid a conflict, is to find ways to reduce tensions. One European NATO diplomat said the alliance wants to stay away from the issues linked to Iran. Instead, the alliance wants to see more calm from the U.S. and Iran, and don't want the matter to become a NATO issue, said the diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity to reveal private discussions. Trump, who withdrew the United States last year from an international deal to limit Iran's nuclear program and then reinstated harsh economic sanctions, says he wants to work out an even more restrictive deal with Tehran. Germany, France and Britain, as well as Russia and China, remain part of the Obama administration-backed nuclear deal that Trump abandoned last year. The 2015 agreement aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions in exchange for relief from economic sanctions. Iran, however, has denounced the latest US sanctions as ""idiotic'' and an obstacle to talks. In response, Trump fired back that ""any attack by Iran on anything American'' would be answered with overwhelming military force that ``in some areas'' would mean ``obliteration.'' The attacks and escalating tensions have raised worries of an impending conflict between the U.S. and Iran. But, in public and private meetings, Esper repeatedly pressed the Trump administration message that America does not want war. ""Most partners in the room acknowledged the challenges we face,'' said Esper. ``I think they appreciate that the United States is not seeking war with Iran that we want to get this off of a military track and onto a diplomacy track.''

Developed by academics at Heriot-Watt University and filmed by BBC's 'Robots and Us', Fabio greeted shoppers with cheerful high fives and offered food samples. Its software being connected to the internet meant it had access to an unlimited amount of information, which it used to respond to questions. ""An issue we had was the movement limitations of the robot.

The decision to hold the conference was taken by leaders of 11 opposition parties last month at the residence of Pakistan peoples Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari in Islamabad. At the meeting, chaired by Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (Fazl) leader Maulana Fazl-ur-Rehman, the opposition leaders reached consensus on formulating strategy for the removal of Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani. Maulana Fazl also suggested that opposition parties should tender resignations in all assemblies to build pressure on the government, but some major opposition parties expressed reservations about the proposal. PML-N and PPP representatives said they could present their case better in parliament. The opposition parties have also decided to observe July 25, the date of last year’s general election, as a “black day” and to hold protests on the day. They added that the PTI government had become a threat to national integrity, sovereignty and interest. The declaration said the poor were facing the brunt of a series of disastrous policies and that the given political situation was paving the way for a violent revolution. Meanwhile, the opposition’s aspirations were dealt a serious blow hours before the meeting as Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M), an important coalition member of the ruling PTI, decided against attending the event. BNP-M chief Akhtar Mengal took the decision after being invited to a meeting with Prime Minister Imran Khan on Wednesday afternoon. Another major party missing from the meeting was the Jamaat-e-Islami (JI), whose chief, Sirajul Haq, had earlier turned down a personal invitation from Maulana Fazl. Prominent leaders among those at Wednesday’s meeting were PML-N president Shahbaz Sharif, PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, former PM Nawaz Sharif’s daughter Maryam Nawaz, ex-PM Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, former National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, former PM Yousuf Raza Gilani, senator Sherry Rehman, former Senate chairman Raza Rabbani, Awami National Party chief Asfandyar Wali Khan and Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai, among others.

Azhar was said to have been at the hospital at the time of the blast, apparently for treatment relating to renal failure. Social media updates on Monday had indicated that around 10 people were injured in the blast, including Azhar. Sources in the security establishment tracking the developments in Pakistan on Wednesday said while it can be said without any doubt that there was a powerful blast at the military hospital, Azhar managed to escape unscathed. Azhar suffers from acute renal failure and is known to visit the Rawalpindi military hospital regularly for dialysis. The hospital is a well-guarded facility located inside the cantonment area that houses the headquarters of Pakistan Army. While Azhar may have escaped any damage, the attack on a seemingly impregnable Pakistani military facility would have surely rattled the Jaish chief, particularly after the IAF strikes in February on the terror outfit’s camp in Balakot deep inside Pakistani territory. Incidentally, Azhar escaped the air strikes as he was believed to have been undergoing treatment at the Rawalpindi hospital. Soon after the Balakot strikes, the Pakistan Army shifted Azhar to a protected location. Late Sunday night, several Pakistani Twitter users uploaded videos of the blast, with some claiming that 10 people had been injured. A Twitter handle with the name Ahsan Ullah MiaKhail, who identifies himself as a human rights worker and PTM (Pashtun Tahafuz Movement) activist, posted a video of the blast along with a comment: ""Huge #blast at Military Hospital in #Rawalpindi, #Pakistan. 10 injured shifted to emergency.

Federal Minister for Revenue Hammad Azhar presented the budget on June 11 in which he had declared that the budgetry allocation for the defence sector was kept the same as the last year's. But the budget document showed a slight increase of 4.5 per cent by the government. According to the documents, the original allocation for defence for outgoing fiscal (2018-19) was Rs 1,100 billion but it was revised later to Rs 1,137 billion, up by 3.4 percent, by the end of the year. So, the actual rise from previous allocation was Rs 52,201 million or 4.5 per cent. Pakistan's military, in a rare move, early this month decided to voluntarily cut the defence budget for the next fiscal year and assured the nation that there would be no impact to its ""response potential"" due to the voluntary cut in the budget. The opposition members were asking for cuts in all other heads of the expenditures, as the cash-strapped nation is to launch an austerity drive to solve the financial woes, but they did not ask for any decrease in the defence budget when it was put for voting. Pakistan in 2018 was the 20th biggest military spender in the world with an expenditure of USD 11.4 billion, a report published by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute said in April. Prime Minister Imran Khan's government has negotiated a USD 6 billion bailout package from the International Monetary Fund to overcome the financial woes facing the country.

Jean Carroll's account of an alleged sexual attack by President Donald Trump more than 20 years ago, both saying in an interview published on Thursday that she had told them about it at the time. Speaking to the New York Times, they said Carroll told them Trump had overpowered her in a Bergdorf Goodman New York department store dressing room in late 1995 or early 1996 and penetrated her in an encounter lasting several minutes. The women, author Lisa Birnbach and former news anchor Carol Martin, said they had given conflicting advice following the attack on Carroll, a longtime advice columnist for Elle magazine, on whether she should report the assault. Trump has denied the accusation, saying the encounter never happened. Similar accusations have emerged in the past two years against a number of powerful men in Hollywood, the media and politics as the women's #MeToo movement has gained traction and shined a light on sexual harassment and violence. More than a dozen women have accused Trump, 73, of making unwanted sexual advances in the years before he entered politics. Trump denied those accusations and went on to win his 2016 White House bid. Carroll's accusation was published on Friday in a New York magazine article adapted from her new memoir. She said she did not report Trump, a wealthy real estate developer, to authorities in the 1990s because she feared retribution. She wrote that Trump pushed her against a wall and pressed his mouth on hers before seizing her arms, pushing her against the wall a second time and penetrating her. A ""colossal struggle"" ensued before she could escape, Carroll, 75, wrote. Birnbach told the Times that what Carroll described to her at the time sounded like rape and urged her friend to go to the police. Martin instead advised Carroll not to tell anyone. Representatives for the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on their account to the Times. Carroll told the Times she did not consider coming forward before the November 2016 election as other women did because she believed such accusations would boost his candidacy. Trump has accused Carroll of lying and seeking to sell more copies of her book. ""I'll say it with great respect: Number one, she's not my type. Number two, it never happened. It never happened, OK?"" he told the Hill newspaper on Monday. With attention shifting to the November 2020 election, few U.S. lawmakers appeared willing this week to take on the latest allegation, with several Democratic senators saying they saw little impact. Some of Trump's fellow Republicans called such behavior unacceptable and said the accusation should be evaluated, while others accepted Trump's denial.

Carol Martin, a former news anchor on WCBS-TV, and Lisa Birnbach, a writer and author of the best-selling book ``The Official Preppy Handbook,'' said they had opposite reactions when Carroll told them of her alleged encounter with Trump at Bergdorf Goodman. Carroll, a feature writer and longtime Elle advice columnist, said that she'd run into Trump at the store and was helping him shop for a gift when he pushed her up against a dressing room wall, unzipped his pants and forced himself on her. Carroll said she used her knee to distance herself and got out of the room. ``I may have tried to hit him with my purse; I don't know,'' she said on the podcast. Birnbach said Carroll called her right after the alleged incident, ``breathless and laughing.'' Birnbach initially laughed along. ``I remember her saying repeatedly, `He pulled down my tights ... which got me to think that was as far as it went.'' Then more details emerged as Carroll described being penetrated. ``And I said, `What? He raped you?''' Birnbach said. ``I said, `Let's go to the police,''' she recalled, but Carroll refused. Martin said she spoke to Carroll within a few days. She recalled that her friend seemed to be ``handling it'' on her own. ``She doesn't break down easily.'' ``I said, `Don't tell anybody,''' Martin said.

Benishangul-Gumuz borders the Amhara region, where authorities foiled a deadly attempt to oust the regional government on Saturday. Three officials, including the region's president, were killed in that attack. Ashadli Hassen, governor of Benishangul-Gumuz, said on Wednesday that the attack on villages in Metakal zone was carried out before dawn Sunday by armed men believed to be followers of the army general who attempted a coup in Amhara, Ashadli Hassen, governor of Benishangul-Gumuz, told The Associated Press Wednesday. The attackers returned to Amhara after the assault in which 18 others were wounded, he said. Authorities said on Monday the general who led the attempted coup in Amhara was killed in a firefight. An internet shutdown remains in force following Saturday's violence, which included the assassination of the national army chief by his bodyguard in the capital, Addis Ababa. Ethiopia's Prime Minister has ordered a crackdown in which hundreds are believed to be in detention. On Tuesday, he sobbed at a service in Addis Ababa for the slain army chief, who was killed along with a retired army general. The unrest is the latest challenge to Abiy, who was elected last year as reformist. He has been pushing through reforms, including making peace with neighbor Ethiopia and freeing many political prisoners - that have captured the imagination of many Ethiopians. The killings in Addis Ababa and Amhara are ""a blow to Abiy's democratization agenda and may well worsen Ethiopia's political and security crisis if key issues are not urgently tackled,'' according to William Davison, senior analyst on Ethiopia for the International Crisis Group.

A 21-month-old girl in the south central province of Uruzgan had been left partly paralyzed by the disease after her parents refused permission for her to receive vaccination. She was the 10th case registered so far this year, compared with 21 for the whole of 2018. ""Our health teams visited the family several times, but unfortunately the family denied (permission) for the child to take the vaccine,"" said Khan Aqa Miakhel, health director of Uruzgan province. Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria are the last three countries in the world where polio is endemic with efforts to eradicate the disease in Afghanistan complicated by the violence across much of the country and by the refusal of some communities to accept vaccination programmes. Hedayatullah Stanekzai, the health ministry's point person on polio, said that out of some 9 million children eligible for vaccination, around 860,000 had not been administered polio drops in 2018, mainly due to security threats. ""We have full preparation and facilities to run a vaccine campaign in the whole country but due to security threats, we can't send our campaigners to the Taliban-controlled and other insurgent areas,"" he said. A Taliban ban on the Red Cross (ICRC) and World Health Organization operating in areas under their control had made the work of prevention more difficult and there was a risk that the disease could break out in other areas, he said. Many health workers administering the vaccines were women, able to gain greater access to families in very conservative areas of the country and their safety was a key concern. ""We are deeply concerned about the Taliban's ban on WHO and ICRC's activities,"" he said. ""If the ban is not lifted soon the polio virus will spread out to the areas which were cleaned in past 18 years,"" he said. Stanekzai said officials were talking to communities in Helmand, Kandahar, Uruzgan and Zabul provinces. ""We are in contact with tribal elders and people to find a solution for the problem, but we hope the anti-polio campaigns are not taken hostage by the warring sides for political purposes.""

"69959088"|"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/experts-fear-snowball-effect-as-iran-abandons-nuclear-deal/articleshow/69959088.cms"|"[AP]"|"DUBAI: As Iran prepares to surpass limits set by its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, each step it takes narrows the time the country's leaders would need to have enough highly enriched uranium for an atomic bomb _ if they chose to build one. The United Nations says Iran has so far respected the deal's terms. But by Thursday, Iran says it will have over 300 kilograms (660 pounds) of low-enriched uranium in its possession, which would mean it had broken out of the atomic accord. European countries that are still a part of the nuclear accord face a July 7 deadline imposed by Tehran to offer a better deal and long-promised relief from U.S. sanctions, or Iran will also begin enriching its uranium closer to weapons-grade levels. Breaking the stockpile limit by itself doesn't radically change the one year experts say Iran would need to have enough material for a bomb. Coupled with increasing enrichment, however, it begins to close that window and hamper any diplomatic efforts at saving the accord. ``I worry about the snowball effect,'' said Corey Hinderstein, a vice president at the Washington-based Nuclear Threat Initiative who once led the U.S. Energy Department's Iran task force. ``Iran now takes a step which puts Europe and the other members of the deal in an even-tougher position.'' Under terms of the nuclear deal, Iran agreed to have less than 300 kilograms (661 pounds) of uranium enriched to a maximum of 3.67%. Previously, Iran enriched as high as 20%, which is a short technical step away from reaching weapons-grade levels. It also held up to 10,000 kilograms (22,046 pounds) of the higher-enriched uranium. Experts who spoke to The Associated Press described the enrichment and stockpile limits in the deal as a sort of sliding scale. Balancing both elements keeps Iran a year away from having enough material for a nuclear weapon, something Iran denies it seeks despite Western concerns about its program. At the time of the deal, which was agreed to by Iran, the United States, China, Russia, Germany, France and Britain, experts believed Iran needed anywhere from several weeks to three months to have enough material for a bomb. However, the stockpile limit isn't an immediate worry from a nonproliferation standpoint, experts say. ``Going over the limit doesn't immediately signify that Iran has enough material that could _ if further enriched and processed _ be used in a nuclear weapon,'' said Tom Plant, the director of proliferation and nuclear policy at London's Royal United Services Institute for Defense and Security Studies. ``It does mean that it builds up reserves of material that could in the future support a more rapid push to the higher levels of enrichment that are suitable for weapons use,'' Plant said. The danger comes July 7, if Iran begins enriching uranium to higher levels. ``If Iran begins stockpiling uranium enriched to higher levels, the breakout timeline would decrease more quickly,'' said Kelsey Davenport, the director of nonproliferation policy at the Washington-based Arms Control Association. Both Davenport and Ian Stewart, a professor at King's College London who runs its antiproliferation studies program called Project Alpha, worry about miscalculations from Iran, the U.S. or the West amid the brinksmanship. ``This highlights the real tension at play in Iran: doing enough to satisfy Iranian hard-liners while also maintaining EU, Chinese and Russian support'' for the deal, Stewart said. ``There's a real risk of miscalculating, not least because it's not clear at which point the EU will have to back away from a noncompliant Iran.'' Davenport says Iran's moves probably are aimed at gaining leverage in negotiations. ``Even if Iran decided to pursue a nuclear weapon, it would still take months to further enrich and weaponize the uranium,'' she said. ``It is critical that the United States does not overreact to a stockpile breach and use it as an excuse to further ratchet up tensions in the region.'' A year after President Donald Trump's unilateral withdrawal from the nuclear deal, the U.S. and Iran are already locked in a volatile standoff. Last week, Iran shot down a U.S. military drone, saying it violated Iranian airspace, though Washington said it was above international waters. The U.S. has blamed Iran for mysterious explosions targeting oil tankers near the Strait of Hormuz. Tehran denied any involvement. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to stop Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Israel has bombed nuclear facilities in Iraq and Syria in the past, and reportedly pushed for a similar strike in Iran prior to the 2015 deal. Iran, for now, allows U.N. inspectors to monitor its nuclear facilities via in-person checks and surveillance cameras. It also has yet to begin widespread use of advanced centrifuges that would speed its enrichment. Experts fear either of those happening. Once Iran starts going beyond the terms of the nuclear deal, one fact remains indisputable: the time it needs to have enough material for a possible atomic bomb starts dropping. ``As soon as they go over 300 or above 3.67, that number is starting to count down from one year,'' Hinderstein warned. ``So if they do both, then it's just going to steepen that line from one year to wherever they end up.''

The US and China have been locked in a bruising trade war since Trump imposed heavy tariffs on imported steel and aluminium items from China in March last year, a move that sparked fears of a global trade war. Trump has already imposed 25 per cent tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports and China has retaliated with tariffs on US goods. In response, China imposed tit-for-tat tariffs on billions of dollars worth of American imports. The church community is up in arm against President Trump as his import duties on Chinese products will increase in the United States the cost of the holy Bible, which is significantly imported from China. According to Congressman Josh Harder, more than half of the Bibles produced in the world originate from China. ""The recently proposed tariffs on an additional $300 billion in Chinese goods, including printed materials, could have significant negative effects on our religious groups, churches, schools, ministries, and nonprofit organisations,"" Harder said. ""More than half of the Bibles printed in the world originate in China due to the unique paper and technologies required,"" he said. Unless the Bibles are excluded from the tariffs, churches, religious schools and other organisations would be forced to pay more for the scripture, he said. ""I don't think the president planned to add an extra tax on Bibles, but that's the practical effect these tariffs would have, and that would make connecting with scripture more difficult for our Christian communities,"" Harder said. ""We need all of these trade wars to end, but in the meantime, we can't allow our congregations to become collateral damage,"" he added, after he wrote a letter to Trump. The Congressman urged the President to exempt the Bibles printed in China from import duty. In the letter dated June 25, the Congressman from California expressed his concern regarding tariffs on printed books which would amount to a ""Bible tax"". If printed books, including the Bibles, are not removed from the list of products that could be impacted by tariffs, consumers and religious groups will be forced to pay higher prices for their Bibles, Harder said. ""While I do not believe this was an intended policy aim, the outcome would be harmful to our religious communities who rely on these sacred texts. I respectfully request that you reconsider the proposed tariffs for books and Bibles,"" the Congressman said. Christian publishers and Bibles societies in the US depend on the capacity and expertise of printers in China to help supply the 20 million Bibles bought each year by Americans, said Stan Jantz, president of the Evangelical Christian Publishers Association. ""A Bible tax would mean fewer Bibles at much higher prices would be available to people who depend on the Bible for their daily spiritual nourishment,"" Jantz said. A 25 percent tariff imposed on Bibles would cause a hardship for many publishers, Jantz said. ""There will be significant damage to Bible accessibility if Bibles and books are not excluded from the tariffs. Some believe such a tariff would place a practical limitation on religious freedom. For sure we know that competitive options for printing Bibles outside of China are limited, especially if the current average price of a Bible is to be maintained,"" he said. According to Mark Schoenwald, president of HarperCollins Christian Publishing, the Trump administration was unaware of the potential negative impact these proposed tariffs would have on the publishing industry generally, and that it never intended to impose a ""Bible Tax"" on consumers and religious organisations. HarperCollins owns Thomas Nelson and Zondervan, two of the largest Bible producers in the United States. ""If printed books, including the Bibles are not removed from the fourth list of products from China to be subject to tariffs and the tariffs go into effect, publishers will reduce investment in their businesses, consumers and religious organisations will face higher prices, and churches, schools, ministries, and nonprofit organisations will have fewer resources to educate others and connect them with the Holy Bible,"" Schoenwald said in a statement. One of the most critical issues facing the book publishing industry is the strong possibility that a tariff of up to 25 per cent will be placed on goods imported from China, including books and the Bibles. As such Evangelical Christian Publishers Association (ECPA) has expressed its concerns to the United States Trade Representative (USTR). Books and the Bibles should be exempted from the Chinese tariff, he argued in a testimony before the USTR this week. Schoenwald and ECPA board member Paul Hendrickson, general manager of Hendrickson Publishers also gave testimonies. The ECPA said a large number of Bibles — well over 50 per cent - were printed in China. While there are some domestic Bible options available, the US printers comparable to China on price and quality do not have the capacity to meet the current demand. The same can be said for four-colour books printed in China.

There will be new demands coming out of India and not just economic in nature; it will be a more digital India, a more gender conscious India and an India promoting a sharper start-up culture,"" Jaishankar said. In reference to his foreign policy plans, the minister added that as India's global interest expands, it will be looking at expanding its global footprint through more diplomatic missions around the world. His interaction during the summit, which forms part of a series of events as part of an ongoing UK-India Week, was followed by another live video link from New Delhi with Congress MP Shashi Tharoor. He admitted that the recent Indian elections had defied all forecasts but that the Opposition is determined to keep the ""government on its toes"". ""The Congress Party was crushed in the elections and is going through a transformation... There will have to be a Congress 2.0,"" Tharoor said. ""The Modi government has hit the ground running and I am sure the UK will be high on its agenda once the succession crisis with Theresa May's exit is resolved,"" he said, adding that Britain needs to reassess its expectations from India to ensure its visa policies are fairer towards Indians. The two-day Leaders' Summit, organised by UK-based media house India Inc, covered a series of topics across technology and innovation as well as engineering and healthcare in the context of bilateral cooperation through debates and discussions between senior executives and policymakers from both countries. ""India has a unique opportunity to be at the forefront of the digital manufacturing age, and India and the UK have plenty of opportunities to strengthen the symbiotic relationship in this area,"" said Baba Kalyani, Chairman and Managing Director of manufacturing major Bharat Forge. ""Many ceilings have been breached in the India-UK relationship and we want to take it to even new heights and breach further ceilings,"" said Indian High Commissioner to the UK Ruchi Ghanashyam.

The prince, 37, second-in-line to the British throne and destined to be the future monarch and as such nominal head of the Church of England, has three children with his wife Kate: George, 5, Charlotte, 4, and Louis, 2. ""It is something I'm nervous about, not because I'm worried about them being gay or anything. It's more about the fact that I'm worried about the pressures they're going to face and how much harder their life could be,"" William said on a visit to a charity which supports LGBTQ+ young homeless people. Asked how he would feel if one of them were to be gay, he said it would be ""absolutely fine"". He said that the issue was something he had only started thinking about since becoming a parent. ""Particularly for my family and the position we are in, that's the bit I'm nervous about,"" he said. ""I fully support whatever decision they make but it does worry me from a parent point how many barriers, hateful words, persecution, all that discrimination that might come. ""That's the bit that really troubles me a little bit."" William made the comments on a visit to the Albert Kennedy Trust (akt) in London to open its new services centre, a trip organised ahead of London's annual Pride in London parade and to recognise the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising. The anniversary commemorates the moment when patrons of a gay bar in New York City's Greenwich Village called the Stonewall Inn rose up in defiance of police harassment, which led to a worldwide movement for equal rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and other queer people. Tim Sigsworth, akt's chief executive, said William's support would make a big difference. ""I was first impressed by his level of knowledge already but his empathy and appreciation of the struggles and challenges faced by LGBT people was incredible to me,"" he said. ""And just his willingness to learn from the young people, his willingness to challenge his own perceptions and his willingness to come out in support of LGBT people in such a personal way as to refer to his children - that will make a massive difference.""

Her arm was draped around his neck suggesting she clung to him in her final moments. The searing photograph of the sad discovery of their bodies on Monday, captured by journalist Julia Le Duc and published by Mexican newspaper La Jornada, highlights the perils faced by mostly Central American migrants fleeing violence and poverty and hoping for asylum in the United States. According to Le Duc's reporting for La Jornada, Oscar Alberto Martinez Ramirez, frustrated because the family from El Salvador was unable to present themselves to US authorities and request asylum, swam across the river on Sunday with his daughter, Valeria. He set her on the US bank of the river and started back for his wife, Tania Vanessa Avalos, but seeing him move away the girl threw herself into the waters. Martinez returned and was able to grab Valeria, but the current swept them both away. The account was based on remarks by Avalos to police at the scene — ""amid tears"" and ""screams"" — Le Duc told The Associated Press. Details of the incident were confirmed Tuesday by a Tamaulipas state government official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity, and by Martinez's mother back in El Salvador, Rosa Ramirez, who spoke with her daughter-in-law by phone afterward. ""When the girl jumped in is when he tried to reach her, but when he tried to grab the girl, he went in further ... and he couldn't get out,"" Ramirez told the AP. ""He put her in his shirt, and I imagine he told himself, 'I've come this far' and decided to go with her."" From the scorching Sonoran Desert to the fast-moving Rio Grande, the 2,000-mile US-Mexico border has long been an at times deadly crossing between ports of entry. A total of 283 migrant deaths were recorded last year; the toll so far this year has not been released. In recent weeks alone, two babies, a toddler and a woman were found dead in the sweltering heat. Three children and an adult from Honduras died in April after their raft capsized on the Rio Grande, and a 6-year-old from India was found dead earlier this month in Arizona, where temperatures routinely soar well above 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The search for Martinez and his daughter was suspended Sunday due to darkness, and their bodies were discovered the next morning near Matamoros, Mexico, across from Brownsville, Texas, several hundred yards (meters) from where they had tried to cross and just a half-mile (1 kilometer) from an international bridge. Tamaulipas immigration and civil defense officials have toured shelters beginning weeks ago to warn against attempting to cross the river, said to be swollen with water released from dams for irrigation. On the surface, the Rio Grande appears placid, but strong currents run beneath. Ramirez said her son and his family left El Salvador on April 3 and spent about two months at a shelter in Tapachula, near Mexico's border with Guatemala. ""I begged them not to go, but he wanted to scrape together money to build a home,"" Ramirez said. ""They hoped to be there a few years and save up for the house."" El Salvador's foreign ministry said it was working to assist the family, including Avalos, who was at a border migrant shelter following the drownings. The bodies were expected to be flown to El Salvador on Thursday. The photo recalls the 2015 image of a 3-year-old Syrian boy who drowned in the Mediterranean near Turkey, though it remains to be seen whether it may have the same impact in focusing international attention on migration to the US ""Very regrettable that this would happen,"" Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Tuesday in response to a question about the photograph. ""We have always denounced that as there is more rejection in the United States, there are people who lose their lives in the desert or crossing"" the river. There was no immediate comment from the White House. US ""metering"" policy has dramatically reduced the number of migrants who are allowed to request asylum, down from dozens per day previously to sometimes just a handful at some ports of entry. The Tamaulipas government official said the family arrived in Matamoros early Sunday and went to the US Consulate to try to get a date to request asylum. The mother is 21 years old and the father was 25, he added. But waits are long there as elsewhere along the border. Last week, a shelter director said only about 40 to 45 asylum interviews were being conducted in Matamoros each week, while somewhere in the neighborhood of 800-1,700 names were on a waiting list. It's not clear what happened to the family at the US Consulate, but later in the day they made the decision to cross. The Tamaulipas official said the father and daughter set off from a small park that abuts the river. Civil defense officials arrived at the scene at 7 p.m. Sunday and later took the wife to the shelter. ""I was drawn to the girl's arm on her father,"" Le Duc said as she described arriving at the scene. ""It was something that moved me in the extreme because it reflects that until her last breath, she was joined to him not only by the shirt but also in that embrace in which they passed together into death."" ""It's a horrifying image,"" Maureen Meyer, a specialist on immigration at the Washington Office on Latin America, which advocates for human rights in the region, said of the photograph. ""And I think it speaks so clearly to the real risks of these US programs that are either returning people back to Mexico seeking asylum or in this case limiting how many people can enter the US every day."" The United States has also been expanding its program under which asylum seekers wait in Mexico while their claims are processed in US courts, a wait that could last many months or even years. This week Nuevo Laredo in Tamaulipas, the same state where Matamoros is located, said it will become the latest city to receive returnees as soon as Friday. Many migrant shelters are overflowing on the Mexican side, and cartels hold sway over much of Tamaulipas and have been known to kidnap and kill migrants. Meanwhile, Mexico is stepping up its own crackdown on immigration in response to US pressure, with much of the focus on slowing the flow in the country's south. ""With greater crackdowns and restrictions,"" said Cris Ramon, senior immigration policy analyst at the Bipartisan Policy Center think tank in Washington, ""we could see more desperate measures by people trying to enter Mexico or the US"".

FBI Special Counsel Robert Mueller, whose 22-month probe into Russia’s interference in the US Presidential elections resulted in a report that neither fully absolved nor specifically indicted President Trump, has agreed to testify before two Congressional panels next month. The public hearings, slated for July 17, are expected to be blockbuster viewing despite waning public interest and the abundant caution Mueller showed in turning in a report that abjured sensation and hewed to constitutional propriety. Effectively, Mueller said it was beyond his remit to indict the President despite instances of impropriety suggesting obstruction of justice, while indicating it was up to Congress to act on the matter. That Congress, now controlled by Democrats, subpoenaed Mueller despite his contention that his 448-page written report should speak for itself and he has no intention to say anything further on the matter. “The report is my testimony ... So beyond what is said here today and what is contained in our written work, I do not believe it is appropriate for me to speak further,” Mueller had said after handing in his 448-page report. But the Democratic chairs of the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees, Jerrold Nadler of New York and Adam Schiff of California, wrote to him on Tuesday saying they understood that he had reservations about appearing on Capitol Hill, but he do so anyway because “the American public deserves to hear directly from you about your investigation and conclusions. “We will work with you to address legitimate concerns about preserving the integrity of your work, but we expect that you will appear before our committees as scheduled,” they told him. Unlike many other Trump administration officials and aides, who have defiantly refused to appear before Democratic committees, Mueller complied, setting the stage for what is one of Washington’s great political spectacles. Expectedly, Trump tweeted that the Democrats’ continued inquiry into what he considers a witchhunt about his alleged ties to Russia amounted to “presidential harassment.” He also began attacking Mueller, accusing him of illegally terminating FBI internal communications between two officials who were anti-Trump, calling it a crime and setting the stage for Republican attack dogs to trash the Congressional hearings. Many Democrats want to use the hearing to build a case for Trump’s impeachment, a process that does not fully enthuse moderates in the party, including the leader and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who would rather the American electorate give their verdict on Trump in the 2020 election. Still, Pelosi welcomed her party colleagues success in summoning Mueller to the Hill, saying “Our national security is being threatened and the American people deserve answers.” The continuation of the Mueller saga heading into the 2020 election cycle comes amid increasingly bitter and fractious politics that that has pitted hardcore Trump loyalists from the American heartland against more liberal and moderate Democratic lawmakers from coastal states and big cities. From Iran to immigration, the two sides are bitterly divided on almost every critical issue facing the United States. The political divisiveness is now seeping into the public arena. On Tuesday night, the President’s son Eric Trump was spat on at a Chicago restaurant by a worker who was reportedly agitated by Trump policies, following which the U.S Secret Service took the person into custody. Elsewhere, the co-captain of the U.S women’s soccer team currently playing in the world cup told a magazine she’s “not going to the fucking White House,” if the team wins the world cup, a remark that Trump noted in his Twitter feed, and told her she should first win before she talks. “Other than the NBA leagues and teams love coming to the White House. Megan (Rapinoe) should never disrespect our Country, the White House, or our Flag, especially since so much has been done for her & the team. Be proud of the Flag that you wear,” Trump tweeted.

People are leaving Congo at a rate of 311 a day, adding pressure on Uganda's already overstretched facilities, said UNHCR spokesman Andrej Mahecic in Geneva. The refugees are running away from clashes between two ethnic groups the Hema and the Lendu in Congo's northeast Ituri province, an area long plagued by violence and lawlessness. More than 160 people have been killed in two weeks of the violence in several villages of Ituri, according to the local governor. Recent arrivals from Congo ``speak of extreme brutality. Armed groups are said to be attacking villages, torching and looting houses, and killing men, women and children,'' Mahecic said in a statement. Uganda has long said it keeps its doors open to all refugees. Most Congolese are fleeing via Lake Albert from Ituri, where an estimated 300,000 people have been displaced since early June, according to Mahecic. A refugee reception center in Uganda is currently home to 4,600 new arrivals, 1,600 more than its maximum intended capacity, he said, noting that ``the pace of new arrivals means needs far outstrip what humanitarians are able to deliver.'' The violence has been taking place in a remote area of Congo near South Sudan and Uganda where the UN says there is limited access for humanitarians. Thousands of people are said to be sleeping in the open and without any kind of food aid. Authorities believe the perpetrators were militia fighters from the Lendu community. Congo's military believes they are linked to Mathieu Ngudjolo, who was acquitted of war crimes at the International Criminal Court in 2012. Untold thousands of people lost their lives in conflicts between Lendu and Hema communities between 1999 and 2004, according to experts. U.N. peacekeepers were dispatched to Congo to try to maintain order and remain in the region combatting various rebel groups. New unrest was seen in 2017 and 2018. Congo has one of the world's largest numbers of displaced people, with some 4.5 million having fled various conflicts across the vast central African nation. Another part of eastern Congo, North Kivu, faces a stubborn Ebola epidemic. Health workers there have been repeatedly attacked, hampering efforts to contain the spread of the viral disease that has killed over 1,400 people since August.

At this week's conference, the Trump administration hopes to draw pledges from business leaders and wealthy Gulf states to fund its economic plan, which calls for $50 billion of investment and infrastructure projects in the West Bank, Gaza and neighboring Arab countries. ``Palestine is not for sale!'' protesters chanted as they filled the streets of major West Bank cities. ``From Bahrain to Saudi Arabia we are not tempted by your millions!'' Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Jordan and various Gulf states have sent finance officials to the workshop. The White House says it did not invite Israeli representatives, so as to keep the event ``apolitical.'' The Palestinian Authority, for its part, has rejected the plan and wants nothing to do with the conference, arguing that an economic proposal cannot pre-empt a political resolution that addresses its long-standing demand for statehood. Thousands across the West Bank held up signs saying ``Down with the Bahrain conference!'' and ``Do not sell the Palestinian cause and erase our identity.'' Scattered clashes erupted as demonstrators hurled stones at Israeli soldiers, who fired back tear gas and rubber-tipped bullets to disperse the crowds. In the northern city of Nablus, protesters hanged an effigy of President Trump from a column. In Bethlehem, the protesters' donkey took center stage, its backside covered with the crossed-out faces of Bahraini King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who are viewed as supporting the White House's efforts. Multiple Palestinian factions, including the Gaza Strip's militant Hamas rulers, have called for continued mass rallies across the West Bank Gaza to coincide with the conference, set to begin Tuesday night. In Gaza, stores and public institutions shuttered Tuesday in observance of a general strike. A black-and-white banner calling for a strike replaced the usually illuminated billboard over the central Omar al-Mukhtar street in Gaza City. Residents of the impoverished territory, where unemployment exceeds 50%, voiced opposition to the Trump team's ambitious proposal, which envisions health, education and public works projects but does not deal with the Israeli military occupation of the West Bank or blockade of Gaza. ``We don't need money. We are not hungry for bread. We are hungry for dignity,'' said Gaza physician Said Jadba. ``They are selling the remainder of the Palestinian cause,'' said Gaza City resident Abu Atef Ellaw. ``This will never pass.'' In Beirut, Lebanon, hundreds of Palestinians took part in a protest orchestrated by Hamas outside the U.N. headquarters, chanting against the economic workshop and the possible naturalization of Palestinians in Lebanon. Some 175,000 Palestinian refugees live in Lebanon, and consider the right of return to their ancestral lands in what is now Israel a part of any future resolution to the conflict. Despite 70 years in the country, Palestinians continue to live under harsh conditions, confined to squalid camps and deprived of basic rights afforded to Lebanese citizens. The U.S. economic plan's large sums for Jordan and Lebanon, countries with substantial Palestinian refugee populations, have raised fears that the Trump administration aims to have Palestinian refugees absorbed into these nations, rather than allow them to someday return to Israel _ one of the most sensitive issues in the conflict. Mahfouz Monawar, head of international relations for the Islamic Jihad group in Lebanon said: ``Today the Palestinian people are saying clearly that the deal of the century with all its components and today with what is going in Manama workshop do not represent the Palestinians.'' ``We as Palestinian resistance factions will be unified to confront this deal until ... the vanishing of the occupation from the Palestinian territories,'' he added. Ahmed Abdul-Hadi, deputy Hamas representative in Lebanon, said the protest represents the Palestinian commitment to the right of return.

Saudi special forces in cooperation with their Yemeni counterparts ""conducted a successful operation that resulted in the capture of the leader of the Daesh (IS) branch in Yemen -- Abu Osama al-Muhajir,"" Maliki said.

Maliki did not specify the location of the house or where the raid was conducted, but said there were no civilian casualties. IS and other jihadist groups have flourished in the chaos of the country's civil war, which pits the government -- backed by the Saudi-led coalition -- against Shiite Huthi rebels. IS has lost its self-styled ""caliphate"" across large parts of Syria and Iraq but is said to run camps and has a number of active fighters across Yemen. Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), considered by the US as the radical group's most dangerous branch, is also active in Yemen. Last month, four suspected Al-Qaeda members were killed in a suicide attack claimed by IS in Bayda province, a local official told AFP. A long-running US drone war against AQAP has intensified since President Donald Trump took office in January 2017.

While Iran's actions will not on their own sound the death knell for the accord, they could mean another stage in its ""gradual disintegration"" which began with US President Donald Trump's dramatic withdrawal from the agreement last year. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) was finally completed in Vienna on July 14, 2015, after years of arduous negotiations between Iran and the US, France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China. The JCPOA's core was ensuring that Iran's nuclear programme stayed entirely peaceful. In return, Iran would benefit from the gradual lifting of stifling economic sanctions. The deal was hailed by its supporters as a big win for multilateralism in general and the Obama administration's foreign policy in particular. But from early on the deal faced criticism in the US, including from then presidential candidate Trump. Iran's foes in the region, such as Saudi Arabia and Israel, also insisted it does not provide sufficient protection against the threat of Tehran ultimately acquiring nuclear weapons. The JCPOA restricts Iran's nuclear programme in several respects and mandates the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to carry out a strict inspections regime of Iranian facilities. The restrictions include a limit of 300 kilogrammes on Iran's stockpiles of enriched uranium, which cannot be enriched beyond 3.67 percent. Its stocks of heavy water are limited to 130 tonnes. Iran's heavy water reactor in Arak was also subject to modifications rendering it unable to produce substantial quantities of plutonium. The IAEA says Iran is subject to one of the most stringent inspections regimes anywhere in the world, and that it has access to all the sites necessary to carry out its work. The other side of the bargain was to be the lifting of sanctions on Iran, notably in its key oil and gas sectors. But after Trump's decision to withdraw from the deal in May 2018, the US re-imposed sanctions and sought to force its allies to drastically reduce economic ties with Iran. The European parties to the JCPOA have tried to respond to the American withdrawal by setting up a special trade mechanism called INSTEX that would allow legitimate trade with Iran to continue without falling foul of US sanctions, but it is still not fully operational. Iran has justified its decision to no longer respect some of the JCPOA's limits by pointing to the fact it is not receiving the economic benefits of the accord following the US withdrawal. On May 8, Iran said it was going to stop respecting the JCPOA's limits on stockpiles of enriched uranium -- expected to be breached on Thursday -- as well as those for heavy water. On Tuesday a senior Iranian security official said that as of July 7 it will start abandoning other parts of the deal, namely the 3.67 percent enrichment limit on uranium and curbs on the development of a heavy water reactor. Reacting to Iran's announcement last week, EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said: ""Our assessment on the implementation of the nuclear deal... will never be based on statements but on the evaluation that the IAEA makes."" The IAEA says it can only present the technical facts it garners as a result of its inspections and that ultimately the question of whether the accord is being respected is one for the deal's signatories. According to Thierry Colville, researcher at Paris's Institute for International and Strategic Affairs (IRIS), the agreement could be in danger of ""gradual disintegration"" rather than a sudden collapse. But a more dramatic breakdown of the deal cannot be ruled out if Iran stopped cooperating with the IAEA's inspections, or seriously ramped up enrichment work. For the moment, ""the Europeans, Russia and China remain committed to the nuclear deal and are seeking solutions to address Iran's legitimate frustration with sanctions relief,"" says Kelsey Davenport from the Arms Control Association. However, ""if the remaining states who are party to the deal abandon that process because of Iran's violations, that will kill the deal,"" Davenport warned. phs/jsk/jza/bmm Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."|"Iran nuclear deal in danger of 'disintegration'"|"Tue Jun 25 21:10:00 CEST 2019"|"[world]"

The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty is expected to formally collapse on August 2 after both Russia and the US pulled out, dealing a blow to international arms control efforts. Stoltenberg said there was ""no indication"" the Kremlin was prepared to destroy a missile system the West says breaches the INF and so NATO defence ministers will use talks on Wednesday and Thursday to agree countermeasures. ""Our response will be defensive, measured and coordinated. We will not mirror what Russia does,"" Stoltenberg told reporters, saying NATO did not intend to deploy new land-based nuclear missiles in Europe. ""We do not want a new arms race, but as Russia is deploying new missiles, we must ensure that our deterrence and defence remains credible and effective."" After years of complaining toRussia about the 9M729 ground-launched cruise missile system, the US announced in February it would pull out of the INF in August unless Moscow backed down. NATO's 29 allies have unanimously backed Washington's assessment that the nuclear-capable missile violates the 1987 treaty, which banned ground launched missiles with a range of 500 to 5,500 kilometres (300 to 3,400 miles). Diplomats say that rather than simply agreeing with the US, several allies have carried out their own independent investigation and reached the same conclusion themselves. A meeting of the NATO- Russia Council has been called next week as a last-ditch bid to persuade Moscow to abandon the missiles and save the treaty. ""We call on Russiato take the responsible path,"" Stoltenberg said. ""But unfortunately, we have seen no indication that Russia intends to do so. In fact, it continues todevelop and field the new missiles."" After long denying the existence of the missile system, Russia now insists it complies with the INF and accuses the US in turn of violating the accord.

Addressing legislators from his ruling party in Parliament, Erdogan again congratulated opposition candidate Ekrem Imamoglu who garnered 54.21% of the vote in Istanbul on Sunday to become Istanbul's mayor. Erdogan had previously congratulated Imamoglu in a tweet. Sunday's results came as a rare electoral defeat for Erdogan and broke the Islamic-leaning ruling party's decades-old grip on Turkey's most important city. It was also a personal blow to Erdogan whose rise in Turkish politics had started with his own election as Istanbul mayor 25 years ago. ""Inline with our political understanding, we cannot be angry or hold a grudge or blame the people,'' Erdogan told his party's legislators. ""We don't have the luxury of turning a deaf ear and ignoring the messages given by the people,'' He said his ruling party, which is scheduled to meet later Tuesday, would determine its ""failings, disunity and errors'' and look for ways to fix them. In a related development, Erdogan in his speech marked the anniversary of last year's electoral win that also ushered in a new political system by abolishing the office of the prime minister and vastly expanded the powers of the president. Critics say the system has eroded democracy and paved the way to one-man rule. Erdogan said the people and country had ``accepted'' and ``adjusted'' to the new system but stated that a committee lead by Vice President Fuat Oktay, would nevertheless be formed to assess possible shortcomings. Hours later, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, who leads the main opposition party that backed Imamoglu, called for the new presidential system to be scrapped. ""Lets lift this one-man regime and build a democratic system,'' Kilicdaroglu said in a speech in Parliament. Speaking to journalists on his way out of parliament, Erdogan wouldn't rule out a Cabinet reshuffle following Sunday's defeat. ""If one is needed we will do it, but we won't take an order,'' Erdogan said. Sunday's repeat election in Istanbul was held after the ruling party challenged the first vote over alleged irregularities, and Turkey's electoral board nullified the results and revoked Imamoglu's mandate after 18 days. Imamoglu won by around 800,000 votes more than his rival, compared with a 13,000-vote margin in the first vote. The win electrified the secular party that has been spent nearly two decades in lackluster opposition as Erdogan strengthened his hold on power. The opposition also gained hold of the municipality of the capital, Ankara, in the March 31 local elections.

President Hassan Rouhani went on to call the sanctions against Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ``outrageous and idiotic,'' especially since the 80-year-old Shiite cleric has no plans to travel to the United States. Yet the sharp response from Tehran shows the pressure that the nation's Shiite theocracy and its 80 million people feel over the maximalist campaign of sanctions by the Trump administration. From Israel, President Donald Trump's National Security Adviser John Bolton said Iran could walk through an ``open door'' to talks with America, though he also warned that ``all options remain on the table'' if Tehran makes good on its promise to begin breaking one limit from its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. While resembling the exchange of insults just before North Korea's leader and Trump sat down for talks, Iran so far appears to have no interest in negotiations ``The useless sanctioning of Islamic Revolution Supreme Leader (Khamenei) and the commander of Iranian diplomacy means closing the doors of diplomacy by the U.S.' desperate administration,'' Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi tweeted. ``Trump's government is annihilating all the established international mechanisms for keeping peace and security in the world.'' The crisis gripping the Middle East stems from Trump's withdrawal of the U.S. a year ago from the nuclear deal with Iran and other world powers and then imposing crippling new sanctions on Tehran. Recently, Iran quadrupled its production of low-enriched uranium to be on pace to break one of the deal's terms by Thursday, while also threatening to raise enrichment closer to weapons-grade levels on July 7 if European countries still abiding by the accord don't offer a new deal. Citing unspecified Iranian threats, the U.S. has sent an aircraft carrier to the Middle East and deployed additional troops alongside the tens of thousands already there. All this has raised fears that a miscalculation or further rise in tensions could push the U.S. and Iran into an open conflict, 40 years after the Islamic Revolution. Trump enacted the new sanctions against Khamenei and his associates on Monday. That action followed Iran's downing on June 20 of a U.S. surveillance drone, worth over $100 million, above the Strait of Hormuz, sharply escalating the crisis. Trump then said he pulled back from the brink of retaliatory military strikes but continued his pressure campaign against Iran. US officials also said they plan sanctions against Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, something that drew Rouhani's anger during his televised address Tuesday. ""You sanction the foreign minister simultaneously with a request for talks,'' an exasperated Rouhani said, calling the sanctions ""outrageous and idiotic.'' ""The White House is afflicted by mental retardation and does not know what to do,'' he added. There was no immediate reaction from Washington to the remarks. The sharp comments recalled North Korea's verbal attacks on Trump before the dramatic change in course and the start of negotiations with Washington. In 2017, state media quoted North Korean leader Kim Jong Un calling Trump ""the mentally deranged US dotard.'' However, there are no signs the Iranian leadership would welcome talks. Mousavi's statement echoed that of Iran's U.N. ambassador, Majid Takht Ravanchi, who warned Monday that the situation in the Persian Gulf is ``very dangerous'' and said any talks with the U.S. are impossible in the face of escalating sanctions and intimidation. Meanwhile, the U.S. envoy at the United Nations, Jonathan Cohen, said the Trump administration's aim is to get Tehran back to negotiations. The sanctions were announced as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo held talks with officials in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia about building a broad, global coalition that includes Asian and European countries to counter Iran. Pompeo is likely to face a tough sell in Europe and Asia, particularly from those nations still committed to the nuclear deal with Iran. Meanwhile, Bolton said Trump was open to real negotiations to eliminate Iran's nuclear weapons program and ``all that Iran needs to do is walk through that open door.'' He was meeting with his Russian and Israel counterparts in a first-of-its-kind trilateral security summit in Jerusalem that was focused on Iranian involvement in regional conflicts, particularly in neighboring Syria. ""As we speak, American diplomatic representatives are surging across the Middle East, seeking a path to peace. In response, Iran's silence has been deafening,'' Bolton said. ""There is simply no evidence that Iran has made the strategic decision to renounce nuclear weapons and open realistic discussions to demonstrate that decision.'' But only hours later, Bolton told a news conference that ""all options remain on the table'' if Iran goes over the limit for its low-enriched uranium stockpile as planned by Thursday. ""It would not be in their interest to do it but they have done a lot of things recently that are not in their interest,'' Bolton said.

Meteorologists blamed a blast of torrid air from the Sahara for the unusually early summer heatwave, which could send thermometers above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) in some places on Thursday and Friday. Experts say such heatwaves early in the summer are likely to be more frequent as the planet heats up -- a phenomenon that scientists have shown to be driven by human use of fossil fuels. In Germany, where forecasters have warned a June record of 38.5 degrees could be smashed, speed restrictions were placed on some stretches of ""autobahns"" as the unusually warm weather raised the risks of ""blow-ups"" -- the hot tarmac breaking up and shredding tyres. A forest fire was raging north of Cottbus, the second-largest city in Brandenburg state, in an area that was just recovering from a fire in 2018. It was deemed especially dangerous due to the risk of unexploded ammunition left in the area, which is home to a military training facility. In Spain, TV weather presenter Silvia Laplana riffed on the doom-filled catchphrase ""Winter is coming"" from the blockbuster series Game of Thrones to describe what lay in store for the country. ""El infierno (hell) is coming,"" she tweeted alongside a weather map which showed most of the country coloured scarlet later in the week. ""Of course it's hot in summer but when you have a heatwave that is so extensive and intense, during which records are forecast to be beaten, it's NOT normal,"" she tweeted. Temperatures are expected to be particularly sweltering in the northeast of Spain, with a stifling 45 degrees expected Friday in the city of Girona, and 44 degrees in Zaragoza at the weekend. Five northern provinces were placed on an orange high alert for a heatwave on Wednesday, with another five to be added by the weekend. Authorities were also taking no chances in France, where a heatwave in August 2003 was blamed for 15,000 deaths, many of them elderly people who were left to fend for themselves. In a highly unusual move, Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer on Monday postponed national school exams to next week. Paris authorities have banned older models of diesel and petrol cars from Paris on Wednesday, fearing a build-up of pollution. Health Minister Agnes Buzyn denied the government was being excessively vigilant. ""For all those who know (the risks), obviously it's too much, but if I can avoid unnecessary deaths, I will continue to communicate about prevention,"" Buzyn told LCI television, referring to the warnings on radio, TV and public transport. The Red Cross meanwhile urged people to check on vulnerable neighbours, relatives and friends, saying the ""coming days will be challenging for a lot of people, but especially older people, young children, and people with underlying illnesses or limited mobility."" Players and spectators at the women's football World Cup taking place in cities around France were also being inundated with messages about keeping hydrated. In a rare gesture by FIFA on Monday evening, fans were allowed to bring their own bottles of water into the Paris stadium where Sweden took on Canada. Phil Neville, the England coach, was sanguine about the impact of the weather on the tournament, however. ""There's no excuse, the players are ready for it."" Meanwhile, French beekeepers and farming groups said they were bracing for a ""catastrophic"" honey harvest this year after frost damage in winter, an unusually rainy spring, and, now, unusually high temperatures. ""In the hives, there is nothing to eat, beekeepers are having to feed them with syrup because they risk dying from hunger,"" added the union, which represents many small farms in honey-producing regions. In the Baltic region of northeast Europe, crowds have flocked to lakes and rivers to cool down, leading to a spike in drownings. Twenty-seven people were reported to have drowned so far in Lithuania where the temperature soared to an unusual high of 35.7 degrees Celsius.

Hundreds of people thronged the Church of God's Wisdom in Nicosia, the capital, to pay a final tribute to the Communist-rooted Christofias, who died at 72 on Friday. The Soviet-educated Christofias served a single five-year term after being elected in 2008, the first Communist to hold Cyprus' top political job. His presidency was tarnished by an unfolding banking crisis that required an international rescue to save the country from financial ruin, as well as an Iranian munitions blast at a naval base that killed 13 people. As with previous presidents, Christofias failed to end the Mediterranean island nation's ethnic division, despite his close relations with Turkish Cypriot left-wing party members. He cited that failure as his main reason for not seeking re-election. But in his eulogy, Communist-rooted AKEL party leader Andros Kyprianou praised Christofias for his integrity. Kyprianou said the former president was a tireless worker who introduced key social reforms and unflinchingly called out the wrongs of ``imperialism'' as well as those committed by both Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots. Kyprianou praised Christofias for steady leadership during his time as AKEL chief, guiding the party through an internal crisis during the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union ``by standing beside the common working man.'' Christofias' son Christos, who leads AKEL's youth wing, hailed his father for his unwavering commitment to his socialist roots. Turkish Cypriot journalist Fatma Kishmir said she brought a handful of soil from Christofias' village of Dikomo, in the breakaway north, to place on his grave. Earlier, thousands paid their final respects to Christofias when he was lying in state.

Johnson, vying with foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt to replace outgoing premier Theresa May, insisted her divorce deal struck with the bloc but repeatedly rejected by MPs was ""basically dead"". The ex-London mayor told a radio phone-in that Britain must ""get ready to come out without an agreement"" and the European Union should match his plan not to impose any tariffs under such a scenario. ""It would be very bizarre if the EU should decide on their own -- we wouldn't put up tariffs -- to impose tariffs on goods coming from the UK,"" he told LBC talk radio. ""It wouldn't be in the interests of their businesses, let alone their consumers. ""It would be a return to Napoleon's continental system,"" he added, invoking the 19th-century French emperor who attempted to blockade Britain in the Napoleonic Wars. During the radio phone-in, former foreign secretary Johnson delved further into his Brexit strategy if he were to be elected Conservative leader -- and therefore prime minister -- by party members next month. The 55-year-old said he wants to ""take the serviceable bits"" of May's withdrawal agreement, while scrapping the ""backstop"" provision -- hated by ardent Brexiteers -- intended to keep the Irish border open. Johnson said he would withhold paying the EU Britain's £39 billion ($50 billion) bill while the two sides negotiate a free trade agreement during an implementation period prolonging current terms. However European leaders have vowed they will not allow London to cherry-pick only the parts of the divorce deal it likes, and that the backstop must remain in place. If Brussels maintains that stance, Johnson said he would ask EU leaders to agree to freeze existing arrangements for up to 10 years while they negotiate their future relationship. That could happen under a provision in World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules, but he acknowledged ""there has to be agreement on both sides"" for such an arrangement. Johnson insisted a way could be found through the political impasse that has led Brexit to be delayed twice already. ""Let's be more positive about this,"" he said.

The Nizam's descendants, Prince Mukarram Jah – the titular eighth Nizam of Hyderabad – and his younger brother Muffakham Jah, have joined hands with the Indian government in the legal battle against the Pakistan government over the funds lying with NatWest Bank plc in London. The dispute revolves around 1,007,940 pounds and nine shillings that were transferred in 1948 from the then Nizam of Hyderabad to the high commissioner in Britain of the newly-formed Pakistan. That amount has since grown into millions as the Nizam's descendants, supported by India, claim it belongs to them and Pakistan counter-claims that it is rightfully theirs. ""His Exalted Highness Nizam VIII and his younger brother have waited decades to receive what their grandfather gifted them. Pakistan has blocked access for 70 years and we hope the recent trial will mean a final resolution at last,"" said Paul Hewitt, partner at Withers law firm, which is representing the eight Nizam of Hyderabad, now in their 80s, in the Royal Courts of Justice in London. The two-week trial, presided over by Justice Marcus Smith, has been presented with arguments from both sides in the case listed as – The High Commissioner for Pakistan in the United Kingdom versus seven others, including the Nizam's descendants, the Union of India and President of India. The judgment in the case is expected in an estimated six-weeks' time. The judge has been asked to determine the ""central question"" of who exactly is the ""beneficial"" owner of the funds belonging to the late Nizam Osman Ali Khan. The Nizam, who faced the quandary of joining Pakistan or staying with India at the time of the funds transfer back in 1948, had later reportedly sought the return of the funds. NatWest Bank has since held on to the funds deposited into the London bank account of then Pakistan High Commissioner Habib Ibrahim Rahimtoola in safekeeping until its rightful legal owner is established. The lawyers arguing for the Nizam's descendants, based in Turkey, have disputed Pakistan's claim over the funds as alleged assistance to Hyderabad in its attempts at the time of ""self-defence against Indian aggression"", by arranging the supply and transportation of arms.

The London-based rights group said it was ""alarmed"" over media reports of preparations to resume hangings although the country still does not have a qualified hangman. ""Sri Lanka's President Maithripala Sirisena must immediately halt his plans to resume executions for at least 13 prisoners convicted of drug-related crimes,"" Amnesty said in a statement. Sirisena in February announced he would carry out the first executions in 42 years within less than two months, but he is yet to sign any death warrant, officials said. He said this was in response to spiralling narcotics-related crime inspired by President Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines. The president has also appealed to human rights organisations not to pressure him on his decision. Criminals in Sri Lanka are regularly handed death sentences for murder, rape and drug-related crimes but since 1976 their punishments have been commuted to life imprisonment. The Justice Ministry which is responsible for the correctional system said more than a dozen people had been shortlisted to fill the vacancy for an executioner, but no formal appointment has been made. While Sri Lanka's last execution was more than four decades ago, an executioner was in post until his retirement in 2014. Three replacements since have quit after short stints at the unused gallows.

Nearly 900,000 Rohingya who fled a military-led crackdown in neighbouring Buddhist-dominated Myanmar in 2017 live in Kutupalong, the world's largest refugee camp, and other temporary settlements in Bangladesh's beach town of Cox's Bazar. ""On sensing the presence of our team, they fired on police, and police also responded,"" said Prodip Kumar Das, a police official in the nearby town of Teknaf. The men attempting to smuggle the refugees, who included some girls, were shot and died on the way to hospital, Das added. The refugees were rescued and sent to two different camps after initial questioning. The clash, around 30 km (19 miles) from Kutupalong, followed a tip-off to police, Das told Reuters, adding that they had retrieved three locally-made guns and 15 rounds of ammunition. The men were themselves Rohingya known to be human traffickers living in the area since their arrival in Bangladesh before 2017, he added. Rohingya civilians who left Myanmar have said they faced atrocities at the hands of its armed forces but almost all such accusations have been denied by the authorities. With doubts over whether they will ever return to Myanmar, some refugees in Bangladesh are being drawn towards drugs and violence, say people in the area and aid workers. The risks of being trafficked have increased as refugees are lured by the promise of work. Anti-trafficking groups fear that routes through the Bay of Bengal are being used to smuggle out Rohingya refugees. In recent months, police and the coast guard have rescued several dozens of them. Last month police killed two suspected smugglers in a gun fight in a nearby area.

The minister of tourism, wildlife and Christian religious affairs said Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent visit to Sri Lanka is a testimony that the country is out of danger now. India had advised its citizens to ""avoid all non-essential travel"" to Sri Lanka, which is on high alert following the suicide bombings on April 21 that killed more than 250 people and left at least twice the number injured. In an effort to ramp up Indian outbound tourists visiting Sri Lanka, the Sri Lanka Tourism in collaboration with SriLankan Airlines, The Hotels Association of Sri Lanka (THASL) and inbound tour operators have introduced attractive packages, specifically targeting India, to revive the industry that had a temporary setback due to the blasts. The packages include discounted airfare, accommodation and transport, including discounts from 30 to 60 per cent. These can be availed across the SriLankan Airlines' network covering 12 cities in India with 123 weekly flights. The five tour packages to Sri Lanka range from a combination of stays in Colombo, Kandy, Nuwara Eliya, Dambulla, Sigiriya and South Coast with multiple options to suit any budget. These offers will be valid for stays from June 10, 2019 to September 30, 2019 and can be availed through travel agents network in India.

The Paris-based anti-money laundering watchdog placed Pakistan on grey list in June 2018 and asked it to implement an action plan to address the issue of money laundering and terror-financing. Shireen Mazari told Parliament that it was criminal negligence that previous governments did not pursue the membership of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) which was set up by the G-7 countries in 1989 to curb money laundering. India became FATF member in 1998 and has been creating issues for Pakistan, she said. ""Parliament should conduct an investigation against specific members of bureaucracy, foreign ministers and institutional heads (of previous governments) for not applying for the membership of the FATF,"" she said. The minister accused that previous rulers were corrupt and involved in money laundering, so they avoided FATF membership. Mazari was irked after reports that India was pushing to get Pakistan on the black list of the FATF. She said Pakistan's membership of the FATF would have saved it from current troubles. She also said that the consular access agreement signed between Pakistan and India in 2008 was not registered in the UN.

If everything goes according to plan, she will be under a mountain of $100,000 in student debt by the time she enters the work force. Like millions of Americans, Walters is paying a steep price for an education that will likely weigh her down financially for much of her adult life. ""I think the student debt crisis is truly a life sentence,"" the 19-year-old Californian told AFP. With 45 million borrowers owing some $1.6 trillion, the debt burden of American college graduates has exploded in recent years. It has emerged as a key issue in the 2020 presidential campaign, with candidate Bernie Sanders unveiling an ambitious plan on Monday to erase all student loan debt. ""Somebody who graduates from a public university this year is expected to have over $35,000 in student loan debt on average,"" said Cody Hounanian, program director of Student Debt Crisis, a California non-profit that assists students and fights for reforms. According to official statistics, 71 per cent of US students are burdened by such debt, with minorities the hardest hit. ""Black women particularly are the most impacted group with the highest student debt total per graduate,"" Hounanian said. Despite scholarships and financial aid available to many, the cost of higher education is such that the majority of students are unable to repay their loans on schedule. ""When borrowers leave school, they're in a program that's supposed to take 10 years... but more and more are enrolling in federal programs that are actually 20 or 25 years in length,"" Hounanian said. In the long term, the loan balance for such people increases, interest accrues, and the debt burden just keeps going upwards, he added. Hounanian spoke of his own experience as an example. ""I had $30,000 in student loan debt, I pay over $150 a month, and that's in one of these affordable repayment programs,"" he said. ""By doing that, my loan balance is actually increasing. I'm not covering even the entire interest that's accrued."" ""I'm paying every month,"" he added, ""just to be more in debt."" Several experts interviewed said it's not unusual to have two generations in one family burdened with student debt. That's the case for Walters, who just graduated with a two-year degree in political science from Pasadena City College, near Los Angeles. While she managed to go through that school without accumulating debt, come autumn she will be entering the prestigious - and much more expensive - University of California Berkeley, with a law degree the ultimate goal. Despite being awarded scholarships, Walters said she will still have to take out loans to pay for nearly $20,000 in annual fees. ""That is basically going to turn into loan after loan after loan... each with individual interest rates and individual payments,"" Walters sighed. She said she grew up listening to her mother, 58, bemoan the student debt that still haunts her. ""I would hear my mom talk about... how it was basically crippling our finances,"" she recalled. ""You know, we couldn't go on vacation, sometimes I didn't get school supplies for the new school year, sometimes we got fewer birthday presents."" Walters said she hopes student debt will be a key issue in the 2020 White House race. For some candidates, it is already front and center. Sanders's ""revolutionary"" bill aims to erase all student loan debt and make public colleges tuition-free - and he wants the financial industry to help pay for it. ""The American people bailed out Wall Street,"" Sanders said, referring to lenders deemed ""too big to fail"" during the late 2000s recession. ""Now it is time for Wall Street to come to the aid of the middle class."" Democratic candidate Elizabeth Warren also has a debt cancellation and free public college plan. ""My dad grew up in an extremely poor family in southern California,"" said Walters. ""The only reason he went to university was because it was free."" Tuition, however, is not the only financial burden of students. In California, for example, housing and living expenses represent more than half of the $35,000 needed annually on average for public university. Hounanian said it was crucial to address those issues to ensure students don't end up saddled with heavy debt before starting their professional lives. ""The system isn't working for students,"" he said. ""It's working for profiteers, for big companies and for those who are making money off of students and borrowers.""

Legalization in Illinois also means that nearly 800,000 people with criminal records for purchasing or possessing 30 grams of marijuana or less may have those records expunged, a provision minority lawmakers and interest groups demanded. Gov. J.B. Pritzker, whose election last year gave Democrats complete control over state government again after four years under GOP predecessor Bruce Rauner, signed the bill in Chicago amid a bevy of lawmakers and pot proponents. Under the measure, residents can purchase and possess up to 1 ounce (30 grams) of marijuana at a time. Non-residents could have up to 15 grams. The law provides for cannabis purchases by adults 21 and older at approved dispensaries, which, after they're licensed and established, may start selling Jan. 1, 2020. That means possession remains a crime until Jan. 1, a spokesman for Senate Democrats said. Pritzker's successful campaign for governor capitalized on growing public sentiment that law enforcement has better things to do than chase pot-smokers and that state government could benefit by regulating and taxing the product as it does alcohol and tobacco. He claimed that, once established, taxation of marijuana could generate $800 million to $1 billion a year in taxes. He initially estimated that in the budget year that begins July 1, dispensary licensing would generate $170 million, but Sen. Heather Steans and Rep. Kelly Cassidy, both Chicago Democrats who have been advocating legalization for at least four years, were forced to lower that estimate to about $58 million in the final proposal. Cassidy added that the fully implemented program might generate only $500 million annually within five years. The marketplace portion of the Illinois law also addresses what critics have complained is the decades-long war on drugs' disproportionate impact on minority communities. State Sen. Toi Hutchinson, a Democrat from Olympia Fields, said it's a generally accepted statistic that blacks are 4 { times more likely to be convicted of low-level pot offenses, but she didn't know if Illinois' numbers are higher than typical. In addition to providing criminal-record scrubbing for past low-level offenders, the law gives preference to would-be marijuana vendors in areas of high poverty and records of large numbers of convictions. And portions tax proceeds must be reinvested in impoverished communities. Police organizations are wary, concerned about enforcing driving under the influence laws and arguing technology for testing marijuana impairment needs more development. Law enforcement organizations were successful in killing an earlier provision that would have allowed anyone to group up to five marijuana plants at home for personal use. Police said they'd have difficulty enforcing that, so the bill was amended to allow five plants to be maintained only by authorized patients under the state's medical marijuana law. They previously could not grow their own. Ten other states and the District of Columbia have legalized smoking or eating marijuana for recreational use since 2012, when voters in Colorado and Washington state approved ballot initiatives. Vermont and Michigan last year were the latest states to legalize marijuana. Vermont did so through the Legislature, the first time it wasn't done through a ballot initiative, but didn't establish a statewide marketplace as Illinois did. Other initiatives have failed. Promising proposals in New York and New Jersey fizzled late this spring. Despite a statewide listening tour on the issue by Pennsylvania's lieutenant governor last winter, the idea never took flight.

Pompeo flew to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to meet their leaders days after Iran shot down a US spy drone, prompting President Donald Trump to order and then cancel a retaliatory strike. In a joint statement, the United States, Britain, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates renewed concern about Iran including over alleged attacks on oil tankers but held out hope for talks.

Iran says the US drone violated its airspace, a charge that Washington denies. The US has sought to end all of Iran's oil exports, one of a series of unilateral sanctions that Tehran has described as ""economic terrorism"".

""We have to build a coalition to prevent what the Iranians are doing in the Gulf, which is to inhibit or undermine the freedom of commerce and trade and freedom of navigation,"" an official told reporters as Pompeo flew from the Saudi port of Jeddah to Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates. The coalition would provide ""both material and financial"" support ""to have eyes on all the shipping"", the official said. Pompeo's trip comes as Trump, who often complains of other nations freeloading on the United States, called on Asian nations in particular to do more to ensure safe passage of oil from the Gulf. The US official said that the coalition concept, which is in its infancy, could involve foreign militaries but that their task would be to observe, not to escort commercial ships. ""It's not about shooting at people. It's about shooting pictures of Iranians,"" the official said. Pompeo met in Jeddah with Saudi King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who last week was linked by a UN investigator to the killing and dismemberment of US-based dissident writer Jamal Khashoggi. The US officials said they did not know if Pompeo raised the issue with Prince Mohammed.

Tiffani Adams's story was posted by a friend on Air Canada's Facebook page, drawing incredulous reactions from readers and a request for details from the airline. According to the post, Adams was flying from Quebec to Toronto Pearson International Airport when she fell asleep, aided by the fact that she'd ended up with a whole row of seats to herself. She woke up in ""pitch black,"" with the plane having landed and apparently been towed away from the airport, after passengers and crew had disembarked. ""I think I'm having a bad dream (because) like seriously how is this happening,"" she wrote. She briefly called a friend but was cut short when her phone's battery died. ""I'm trying to focus on my breathing and control my panic attack while I attempt to charge my phone by plugging into every USB port I could find,"" she wrote, but that proved fruitless because the electricity on the plane was turned off. After finally finding a torch in the cockpit, she managed to open one of the doors but faced a drop of up to 50 feet (15 meters) to get out of the plane. She then used the torch to draw the attention of a luggage cart driver, who arrived to find Adams with her legs hanging out of the plane's open doorway. ""He is in shock, asking how the heck they left me on the plane,"" she said. ""I'm wondering the same."" Air Canada apologized for the incident, Adams said, but she hasn't had much sleep since and is struggling with night terrors.

Malaysia filed criminal charges against three units and two ex-employees of the Wall Street titan in December, accusing them of misappropriating $2.7 billion and other crimes in relation to bond issues they arranged for 1MDB. Allegations that huge sums were looted from the investment vehicle — in a fraud that allegedly involved former Malaysian leader Najib Razak — contributed to the last government's election defeat last year. At a procedural hearing in Kuala Lumpur Monday, Goldman lawyer Hisyam Teh Poh Teik said the Hong Kong unit of the bank received its summons just last week, while the summons sent to the Singapore unit only included three out of four charges. The third Goldman unit in the case is based in London. He asked for three months to get further instructions from his clients, and the judge set September 30 for another procedural hearing. Prosecutor Aaron Paul Chelliah told reporters that the prosecution believed all documents had been properly served. ""Their clients have some reservations on whether they were properly served,"" he said. ""Our position is they have been served."" Goldman helped arranged bonds totalling $6.5 billion on three occasions for 1MDB, for which they earned fees said to be well above typical rates. The bank and its former employees are accused of making false and misleading statements to misappropriate huge sums from the 2012 and 2013 bond issuances. Goldman has vowed to fight the charges, saying the former Malaysian government and 1MDB lied to the bank. The former bankers accused in the case are Tim Leissner and Ng Chong Hwa, and both have also been charged in the US over the scandal. Leissner pleaded guilty in America, while Ng was extradited to the US from Malaysia in May and pleaded not guilty.

The boys who became known as the Wild Boars, their soccer club, took part in a Buddhist ceremony in which they gave food to monks to make merit. They then attended a news conference to talk about their lives over the past year. Chanin Vibulrungruang, 12, the youngest of the group, said he now has tell his parents where he's going every time he leaves his house. ""I already told my mom I was coming to this event,"" Chanin joked. ""My life has changed a lot since then because many people recognize me now."" The boys and their coach entered the Tham Luang cave complex in far northern Thailand after soccer practice last June 23, leaving their bicycles and soccer cleats outside the entrance. Rising floodwater quickly trapped them inside, and when they didn't return home a massive search was launched. The boys spent nine nights lost in the cave, living on very little food and water, before they were found spotted deep in the twisting cave complex huddled on a patch of dirt above the rising water line. It was a moment captured on video and soon broadcast to the world. It would be another eight days — until July 10 — before they were all safe. A team of expert divers guided each of the boys out of the cave on special stretchers. The operation required placing oxygen canisters along the path where the divers maneuvered dark, tight and twisting passageways filled with muddy water and strong currents. The drama of the ordeal kept the world watching and the boys have since become celebrities. ""I want to say thank you to everyone who took part in saving all of our lives,"" Ekapol Chantawong, the 26-year-old coach who led the boys into the cave, told reporters. ""We promise that we'll be good role models to society, and we also love everyone."" Ekapol said most of the boys — now aged 12-17 — still dream of becoming professional soccer players, while some want to become Navy SEALs like those who took part in their search and rescue. Monday's news conference was the second of two days of events held to mark the anniversary. On Sunday, several of the boys, their coach and a number of the local and foreign divers took part in a bike ride and run to raise money to improve conditions at the cave. The news conference was held at the Saman Gunan monument center, an art gallery erected near the cave to honor the fallen former Thai Navy SEAL who died while working on the search and rescue. ""This place is very important for us,"" said one of the boys, Adul Sam-on, who is now 14. ""Partly because of Lt. Saman, who is like a second father to us. He was the one who helped us, and we need to remind ourselves that every day."" Gunan's widow, Valepon Gunan, said: ""I believe that my husband is still looking over all of them."" The day's events were organized by the 13 Tham Luang Co. Ltd., a company that manages business opportunities stemming from the ordeal that was established with help from Thailand's military government. All 13 survivors hold shares in the company with coach Ekapol acting as chairman. Ekapol was asked about comments on social media that have criticized the group for seeking to profit from the crisis. ""Everybody's entitled to their own opinions,"" Ekapol said. ""All we can do is find a way to live with it. In the end, it's their right to think about us any way they want.""

The diagnosis of his disease came when Hawking was 21 years old, in 1963. Why Stephen Hawking never won the Nobel Prize The theoretical physicist had thirteen honorary degrees, says a biography on his web site. He was awarded the CBE (1982), Companion of Honour (1989) and the Presidential Medal of Freedom (2009). He was also the recipient of many awards, medals and prizes, most notably the Fundamental Physics prize (2013), Copley Medal (2006) and the Wolf Foundation prize (1988). He was a Fellow of the Royal Society and a member of the US National Academy of Sciences and the Pontifical Academy of Sciences. Stephen Hawking was a mediocre student but an excellent oarsman: Here are some fascinating facts about the physicist Hawking's many publications include The Large Scale Structure of Spacetime with G F R Ellis, General Relativity: An Einstein Centenary Survey, with W Israel, and 300 Years of Gravitation, with W Israel.

Mnangagwa said selling the elephant tusks and rhino horns would enable the impoverished nation to fund conservation efforts for 20 years. Zimbabwe, Botswana, Namibia and Zambia have all cited the growing number of elephants in some areas in their bid to have the ban relaxed, angering many conservationists. Opening the UNEP wildlife economy summit in Victoria Falls, Mnangagwa called ""for the free trade in hunting products as these can have an important impact on national and local economies."" ""Currently Zimbabwe has about $600 million dollars worth of ivory and rhino horns stocked -- most of which is from natural attrition of those animals. ""The revenue would suffice to finance our operational conservation efforts for the next two decades.""

But over the past decade, the population of elephants across Africa has fallen by about 111,000 to 415,000, largely due to poaching, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Botswana recently sparked controversy by lifting its ban on hunting, saying the move would help control a booming elephant population that was damaging farmers' livelihoods.

Russia has been fiercely critical of US plans to deploy missile systems in eastern Europe, and of Washington's withdrawal from the INF arms control treaty. The Cuban missile crisis erupted in 1962 when the Soviet Union responded to a US missile deployment in Turkey by sending ballistic missiles to Cuba, sparking a standoff that brought the world to the brink of nuclear war. The crisis was defused when Soviet ships headed for Cuba turned back in the face of a US naval blockade. Eventually, the Soviet Union agreed to remove its missiles from Cuba; in return, the United States promised not to invade Cuba and, secretly, said it would remove the US missiles from Turkey. ""If things get as far as an actual deployment on the ground of these sorts of systems, then the situation won't just get more complicated, it will escalate right to the limit,"" RIA news agency quoted Ryabkov as saying. ""We could find ourselves in a situation where we have a rocket crisis close not just to the crisis of the 1980s but close to the Caribbean crisis,"" Ryabkov said, using the standard Russian term for the Cuban missile crisis. Russian President Vladimir Putin made similar remarks in February, when he warned that Moscow would match any U.S. move to deploy new nuclear missiles closer to Russia by stationing its own missiles closer to the United States, deploying faster missiles or both. Earlier that month, the United States said it would withdraw from the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia in six months unless Moscow ended violations of the landmark 1987 arms control pact.

Hong Kong has been rocked by major protests over a bill that would allow people to be extradited to the mainland to face trial in courts controlled by the Communist party. It triggered the most violent protests in decades when police fired rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse the crowds. The extradition bill and police reaction to the protests drew international criticism from rights groups. Following historic protests, the Hong Kong government retracted plans to bring about the controversial law. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam also indefinitely suspended debate on the issue. But protesters are demanding that she formally withdraw the proposed changes to the extradition laws. Some also want Lam to resign. China said it would oppose any attempt by the US or any other country to raise the current civil strife in Hong Kong during G-20 summit on June 27-28 in Osaka, Japan. The issue is expected to be raised by Trump during his meeting with Xi as well as other G-20 members at the summit.

Trump's move to impose fresh set of sanctions on Iran comes days after Tehran said it shot down an American drone in the region on Thursday. President Trump called off a planned retaliatory military strike on Friday, saying the response would not have been ""proportionate"". ""We do not seek conflict with Iran or any other country,"" Trump said in a brief interaction with reporters at his Oval Office here. ""I can only tell you we cannot ever let Iran have a nuclear weapon,"" he said. Trump said that the executive order signed by him will impose ""hard hitting"" sanction on Iran and it will deny the Iranian Supreme Leader and other officials access to financial instruments. He signed the order in presence of treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin. ""I think a lot of restraint has been shown by us but that doesn't mean we're going to show it in the future,"" Trump said. ""We will continue to increase pressure on Tehran,"" he said. When asked if his executive order was in response to the Iranian attack on US drone, Trump replied ""you could probably add that into this"" but then said, ""this was something that was going to happen anyway."" ""I know many Iranians living in New York, and they're fantastic people,"" Trump said in response to a question. The President's order will deny Iran's leadership access to financial resources and authorises the targeting of persons appointed to certain official or other positions by the Supreme Leader or the Supreme Leader's Office. Moreover, any foreign financial institution that knowingly facilitates a significant financial transaction for entities designated under this Executive Order could be cut off from the US financial system. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement that ""this action was taken as part of the administration's maximum pressure campaign against the Iranian regime which has engaged in 40 years of terror and aggression against the United States and our allies. Most recently, it targeted a US unmanned aircraft and executed attacks on international shipping"". The Supreme Leader's Office has enriched itself at the expense of the Iranian people. It sits atop a vast network of tyranny and corruption that deprives the Iranian people of the freedom and opportunity they deserve, he said. ""Today's action denies Iran's leadership the financial resources to spread terror and oppress the Iranian people. ""The only path forward is for Iran to negotiate a comprehensive deal that addresses the full range of its destabilising behaviours. Until it does, our campaign of diplomatic isolation and maximum economic pressure will continue. When the Iranian regime decides to forgo violence and meet our diplomacy with diplomacy, it knows how to reach us,"" Pompeo said. Giving details of fresh sanctions, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin told reporters at a White House news conference that it includes actions against eight senior commanders of Navy, Aerospace and Ground Forces of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). ""The United States is targeting those responsible for effectuating the Iranian regime's destructive influence in the Middle East. IRGC commanders are responsible for the Iranian regime's provocative attacks orchestrated in internationally recognised waters and airspace, as well as Iran's malign activities in Syria. ""Treasury will continue to aggressively target the senior leaders and the financial apparatus sustaining this malign activity.

On a day trip scheduled after Iran shot down a US drone, Pompeo flew into the Red Sea city of Jeddah and met with King Salman at his palace. ""You are a dear friend,"" the king told Pompeo as he shook hands with the top US diplomat and his aides. Pompeo is later due to meet the powerful crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, before flying for talks in the United Arab Emirates, US officials said. Both Saudi and Emirati leaders advocate a tough US approach against regional rival Iran, whose downing of the unmanned drone prompted President Donald Trump to order a military strike before changing his mind. Pompeo, speaking to reporters as he left Washington, called Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates ""two great allies in the challenge that Iran presents"". ""We'll be talking with them about how to make sure that we are all strategically aligned and how we can build out a global coalition,"" Pompeo said. He said the United States sought a coalition ""not only throughout the Gulf states but in Asia and in Europe that understands this challenge and that is prepared to push back against the world's largest state sponsor of terror"". But the hawkish US stance has drawn limited support among its allies in Europe, which still support a denuclearisation deal negotiated under former president Barack Obama from which Trump pulled out last year, triggering tensions. Iran says that the US drone encroached its airspace -- a charge that Washington denies -- and accuses Washington of waging economic warfare by unilaterally imposing sanctions, including trying to stop all its oil exports. The US pointman on Iran, Brian Hook, on Monday held his own talks in Oman, which has often served as a go-between for Washington and Tehran. Pompeo's trip comes despite growing controversy inside the United States over the Trump administration's cosy relationship with Mohammed bin Salman after US-based dissident writer Jamal Khashoggi was killed and dismembered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last year. Pompeo used rare emergency powers, citing Iran as a threat, to authorise $8.1 billion in weapons sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, despite concerns in the US Congress that the arms will go to kill civilians in the devastating war in Yemen.

The attorney general said in a letter to Sri Lanka's acting police chief that a presidential commission of inquiry had found ""major lapses"" by Fernando, who has since resigned from his top job. While Fernando is the most senior defence official to face action, President Maithripala Sirisena also suspended police chief Pujith Jayasundara after he refused to step down over the handling of the attacks. Jayasundara and Fernando have testified before a parliamentary inquiry and accused Sirisena of failing to follow established protocols in assessing threats to national security. Last week, the attorney general ordered investigations against nine police officers for failing to act on warnings ahead of the bombings, carried out by Islamic State-backed local jihadists. All nine were senior officers in the districts where the attacks were carried out and have now been transferred from their posts pending disciplinary action and criminal investigations. Authorities have admitted that warnings sent by India of an impending attack by a local group, the National Thowheeth Jama'ath (NTJ), were ignored. Some 45 foreign nationals were among the dead and 500 people were injured in the attacks. The tourist hotspot has been under a state of emergency since. Sri Lanka's State Intelligence Service (SIS) has also been criticised for failing to act on the Indian warnings, but no-one from the state spy service has been put under investigation. Sirisena, who is also defence minister and law and order minister, has also faced allegations that he could have prevented the attacks. The president has objected to a parliamentary investigation into the attacks and ordered police not to co-operate. The hearings have gone ahead, however, and police have testified before legislators.

The alert system was introduced in France following the summer of 2003, which saw an estimated 15,000 heat-related deaths, many of them older people left in city apartments and retirement homes that were not air-conditioned. French Health Minister Agnes Buzyn said Monday that ""everything is ready, in retirement homes, in hospitals, in transports."" ""Yet when people are fragile, even when everything is organized, there's always a higher mortality rate,"" she warned. Organizers at the Women's World Cup, which is being hosted by France, could be faced with implementing FIFA heat precautions, since knockout soccer games are being played every day this week except Wednesday and Sunday. Those precautions include holding official cooling breaks or even postponing the match if the heat at the stadium is too high. Luckily, most of the women's games are being held at night. Similar heat is also expected in Belgium, Switzerland and Germany. In Germany, temperatures above 40 degrees C are possible in some places on Wednesday, topping the country's previous June record of 38.2 degrees Celsius (nearly 100.8 degrees Fahrenheit) set in Frankfurt in 1947. Rescue services have urged people to look out for young children, the elderly and those with compromised immune systems who are at particular risk in high temperatures. Parts of northeastern Germany are also at high risk for forest fires. Authorities in the eastern state of Brandeburg, which circles Berlin, say the risk of forest fires is at the highest level in the coming days. Scientists say measurements show heat waves in Europe are becoming more frequent. Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research said ""monthly heat records all over the globe occur five times as often today as they would in a stable climate."" ""This increase in heat extremes is just as predicted by climate science as a consequence of global warming caused by the increasing greenhouse gases from burning coal, oil and gas,"" he added. Dim Coumou, a scientist at the Free University of Amsterdam, said melting Arctic sea ice is also affecting atmospheric circulation, which in turn makes extreme heat more likely. ""Data analysis shows that the normally eastward travelling summer circulation of the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes has slowed down, including the Jet Stream,"" he said. ""This favors the buildup of hot and dry conditions over the continent, sometimes turning a few sunny days into dangerous heat waves.""

In handing down the sentence, the three-judge panel said that Nicholas Metaxas appeared to have mounted a ""campaign of murder"" in choosing defenseless women, most of whom came to Cyprus looking for work. The judges said Metaxas ""didn't even hesitate to kill children"" over a two-year period during which prosecutors said he sought out many of his adult victims on online social networks using the handle ""Orestes35"" and had sex with them. Five life terms will run consecutively, while two will run concurrently. The judges said there could be no mitigating circumstances in such a case. Earlier, Metaxas pleaded guilty and tearfully apologized to the families of his victims for the ``unjust pain'' he has caused them. Reading from a prepared statement, Metaxas said he doesn't ""have any clear answers"" why he committed the killings and that he has ""struggled"" to figure out the ""why and how."" The 35-year-old officer said his cooperation with police investigators was the least he could do to ease the pain he caused to the families of the victims and his own family. Metaxas killed four Filipino women and the daughter of one of them, as well as a Nepalese woman and a Romanian mother and her daughter. ""I cannot go back in time and undo what I have done,"" Metaxas, clad in a bulletproof vest and surrounded by armed police, told a packed courtroom. He asked authorities for a scientific panel to interview him in order to delve into his psyche and find the reasons for his actions in what's believed to be the east Mediterranean island nation's first serial killer case. He did speak of unspecified events in his past ""decades ago"" that he tried to forget. He looked down throughout his court appearance as a state prosecutor said six of the victims died of strangulation and the seventh of a massive head injury. The case came to light on April 14 when the decomposing body of Mary Rose Tiburcio, 38, from the Philippines, was found by chance down a flooded mineshaft that was part of an abandoned copper mine. Four days later, the body of 28-year-old Arian Palanas Lozano, also from the Philippines, was pulled out of the same mineshaft. Investigators homed in on Metaxas after scrutinizing the online communications of both women. Metaxas, a divorced father of two children aged 6 and 9, initially refused to cooperate with investigators. But as the evidence increased, he buckled and confessed in a 10-page handwritten note to the seven killings. His victims included Romanian Livia Florentina Bunea, 36, and her 8-year-old daughter Elena Natalia; Maricar Valtez Arquiola, 31, from the Philippines; Ashita Khadka Bista, from Nepal; and Tiburcio's daughter, Sierra Grace. Metaxas led police to where he disposed of his victims' bodies; the bound remains of Bunea, her daughter and Arquiola were placed in suitcases and thrown into a toxic lake that was part of the same abandoned mine. Bista's skeletal remains were found down a dry well inside an army firing range. Tiburcio's daughter was found in another lake, wrapped in a sheet and weighed down by a rock. Metaxas had told investigators under questioning that what prompted him to strangle Tiburcio and Bunea was his ``hatred'' of them and desire for ``vengeance'' over his suspicions that they prostituted their daughters. He said he choked the children to death as they slept ``so that they would no longer have to suffer.'' Prosecutors said investigations found that both mothers were very loving and cared for their children. Metaxas also told investigators that he strangled Maricar and Lozano as he climaxed during sex with them. He said he killed Bista, who died of a head injury, in anger after she spat at him for videoing their sexual encounter. All Metaxas' victims except Bista had been reported missing to police shortly after their disappearanceThe disappearance of Bunea and her daughter in October 2016 was the subject of an investigative report by a local TV reporter, who said police claimed they had good reason to believe that the mother and daughter had crossed into the breakaway north of the ethnically split island. Police failures to probe those missing persons cases resulted in the resignation of the justice minister and the firing of the police chief. Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades said lives could have been spared had police acted swiftly in investigating those initial reports.

Pompeo flew to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to meet their leaders days after Iran shot down a US spy drone, prompting President Donald Trump to order and then cancel a retaliatory strike. In a joint statement, the United States, Britain, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates renewed concern about Iran including over alleged attacks on oil tankers but held out hope for talks. ""We call on Iran to halt any further actions which threaten regional stability, and urge diplomatic solutions to de-escalate tensions,"" said the statement released by the United States on Monday. Trump has said he wants negotiations with Iran, which has replied that he is insincere after walking away from an earlier denuclearisation deal and slapping punishing sanctions. Iran says the US drone violated its airspace, a charge that Washington denies. The US has sought to end all of Iran's oil exports, one of a series of unilateral sanctions that Tehran has described as ""economic terrorism"". US officials travelling with Pompeo cast the drone as a defensive push against Iran, which has in the past threatened to shut the Strait of Hormuz, the chokepoint to the Gulf through which 20 percent of the world's oil flows. ""We have to build a coalition to prevent what the Iranians are doing in the Gulf, which is to inhibit or undermine the freedom of commerce and trade and freedom of navigation,"" an official told reporters as Pompeo flew from the Saudi port of Jeddah to Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates. The coalition would provide ""both material and financial"" support ""to have eyes on all the shipping"", the official said. Pompeo's trip comes as Trump, who often complains of other nations freeloading on the United States, called on Asian nations in particular to do more to ensure safe passage of oil from the Gulf. The US official said that the coalition concept, which is in its infancy, could involve foreign militaries but that their task would be to observe, not to escort commercial ships. ""It's not about shooting at people. It's about shooting pictures of Iranians,"" the official said. Pompeo met in Jeddah with Saudi King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who last week was linked by a UN investigator to the killing and dismemberment of US-based dissident writer Jamal Khashoggi.

The senior Conservative Party MP and minister in the UK Cabinet, who was the chief guest at the first-ever India Day at the Houses of Parliament complex in London, welcomed the event to launch UK-India Week 2019 as an important reminder of the need to be more ambitious with India-UK ties. ""I do hope that Jeremy Hunt will be our next Prime Minister and I know that he takes relations with India very seriously and it will certainly be top of his in-tray,"" said Rudd, in reference to the ongoing prime ministerial contest between UK foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt and former foreign secretary Boris Johnson. ""UK-India Week is a wonderful reminder of the ties the UK and India share. There is a need to be ambitious from the UK's side, but one thing is certain that Britain is a steadfast friend of India and vice versa,” she said. The India Day event, hosted by the Indian High Commissioner to the UK, Ruchi Ghanashyam, and Indian-origin peer Lord Jitesh Gadhia, involved a special reception and high-profile roundtables between business executives and policymakers from both countries and the ruling Conservative Party and the Opposition Labour Party in the House of Lords complex in London. ""India Day and UK-India Week reflect the passion that exists in the UK for a good relationship with India. Recent FDI figures are proof that the interest of Indian businesses remains strong. Brexit or no Brexit, there is a confidence in the UK as a place to do business,"" said Ghanashyam. Gadhia added: ""The UK's relationship with India is a litmus test for anyone who advocates a brighter future for the UK outside the European Union (EU). ""If we can't win big with the largest Commonwealth nation, where English is the lingua franca of business; which uses a similar common law system and institutional frameworks; and where over 1.5 million members of the Indian diaspora in UK provide a 'Living Bridge', then where are we going to secure the spoils of Brexit?” UK-India Week will involve a series of events through the week to explore investment opportunities between the two countries, including a Leadership Summit in Buckinghamshire in south-east England between Tuesday and Thursday and concluding with UK-India Awards on Friday.

The candidates to replace Theresa May as the next British prime minister face the Conservative party's 160,000 members in a postal ballot to decide between Hunt and Johnson and the contest is getting increasingly heated between the contenders. ""When I was backpacking through India, I once had a bhang lassi - which is a kind of cannabis lassi - that's the naughtiest thing I am prepared to confess to on this programme,"" Hunt said on a television interview when asked about his naughtiest act. Hunt, who challenged Johnson to engage in more open debates with him, said it was important for both candidates to lay out their agenda clearly. ""On the question of debates, he is being a coward. It is cowardice not to appear in head-to-head debates,"" he said in reference to Johnson turning down a debate planned by Sky TV in the UK. ""People need to know what you are going to do and you need to answer those questions. I promise Boris Johnson the fight of his life and he is going to have that and he is going to lose,"" he added. Meanwhile, Johnson has been under pressure to answer questions about a row with his girlfriend last week, which led to police being called to his London home.

Indian-origin former UK cabinet minister Priti Patel, a supporter of Johnson, attacked a recording of the argument being made by neighbours and then given to the 'Guardian' newspaper.

The record number of climbers crowding the world’s highest mountain this season has left a government cleanup crew grappling with how to clear away everything from abandoned tents to human waste that threatens drinking water. Budget expedition companies charge as little as $30,000 per climber, cutting costs including waste removal. Everest has so much garbage — depleted oxygen cylinders, food packaging, rope — that climbers use the trash as a kind of signpost. But this year’s haul from an estimated 700 climbers, guides and porters on the mountain has been a shock to the ethnic Sherpas who worked on the government’s cleanup drive this spring. Moreover, the tents are littering South Col, or Camp 4, which, at 8,000 meters (26,240 feet) is the highest campsite on Everest, just below the summit. The high winds at that elevation have scattered the tents and trash everywhere. ""The altitude, oxygen levels, dangerously icy and slippery slopes, and bad weather of South Col make it very difficult to bring such big things as tents down,"" said Dawa Steven Sherpa, who led an independent cleanup last month and has been a leading figure in the campaign to clean Mount Everest for the past 12 years. Exhausted climbers struggling to breathe and battling nausea leave heavy tents behind rather than attempt to carry them down. Sherpa said the logos on the ice-embedded tents that identify the expedition companies were deliberately ripped out so the culprits could evade detection. ""It took us an hour to dig out just one tent out of the frozen ice and bring it down,"" said Sherpa. His expeditions have alone brought down some 20,000 kilograms (44,000 pounds) of garbage since 2008. Sherpa estimated 30 tents had been left on South Col, and as much as 5,000 kilograms (11,000 pounds) of trash. Bringing it down is a herculean task when any misstep at such altitudes could be fatal. It is impossible to know exactly how much litter is spread across Everest because it only becomes visible when the snow melts. At Camp 2, two levels higher than Base Camp, the campaigners believe that around 8,000 kilograms (17,637 pounds) of human excrement were left during this year’s climbing season alone. Some climbers do not use makeshift toilets, instead digging a hole in the snow, letting the waste fall into small crevasses. However, rising temperatures have thinned the glacier, leaving fewer and smaller crevasses. The overflowing waste then spills downhill toward Base Camp and even communities below the mountain. People living at the Base Camp use melted snow for drinking water that climbers’ toilets threaten to contaminate. ""During our expedition to Camp 2, eight of our 10 Sherpas got stomach illness from bad water at Camp 2,"" said John All, a professor of environmental science at Western Washington University who visited Everest on a research expedition. For the Nepalese who regard the mountain as ""Sagarmatha,"" or Mother of the World, littering amounts to desecration. Climber Nima Doma, who returned recently from a successful ascent, gets angry thinking that the sacred mountain is being turned into a garbage dump. ""Everest is our god and it was very sad to see our god so dirty. How can people just toss their trash on such a sacred place?"" she said. The trash is creating danger for future climbers and spurring calls for action now. ""When the snow melts the garbage surfaces. And when there is high wind, tents are blown and torn and the contents are scattered all over the mountain, which makes it even more dangerous for climbers already navigating a slippery, steep slope in snow and high winds,"" said Ang Tshering, former president of Nepal Mountaineering Association. Ang Dorjee, who heads the independent Everest Pollution Control Committee, has demanded that the Nepal government — whose general oversight of Everest has come under scrutiny this year as climbers died waiting in line to ascend — institute some rules. ""The problem is there are no regulations on how to dispose of the human waste. Some climbers use biodegradable bags that have enzymes which decompose human waste but most of them don’t,"" he said. The bags are expensive and have to be imported from the United States. ""The biggest problem and concern now on Everest is human waste. Hundreds of people are there for weeks who go to open toilets,"" Tshering said. Melting conditions at Camp 2 create a odor that is sickening to climbers, and the waste will eventually contaminate water sources below and become a health hazard, he said. Tshering and other mountaineers say the government should mandate the use of biodegradable bags. It would spare Dorjee and his team the unpleasant task of collecting the waste and carrying it down the dangerous slopes. The government is working on a plan to scan and tag climbers’ equipment and gear. All climbers would have to deposit $4,000 before their ascent and might not get the money back if they return without their items.

In the ad, several women representing different professions — including a journalist and doctor — are seen pushing dirty sheets hanging on a clothesline off the screen. The sheets are printed with common refrains used to reinforce the oppression of women in Pakistan, including the question ""What will people say?"", which heralds scandal every time a woman chooses to challenge gender norms. The commercial ends with a close-up shot of the Pakistan women's cricket team captain Bismah Maroof saying: ""Stay within the house...these are not only sentences but stains"". Social media was abuzz on the issue, with conservatives lambasting its message using the hashtag ""#BoycottAriel"" on Twitter. ""They (are) insulting Islamic teaching in their advertising,"" wrote Binte Suleman on Twitter, while Raja Moazzam added: ""Please take action against these liberals, who (are) prompting liberalism in Pakistan"". Others called for Pakistani regulators to have the commercial officially censored and removed. The company did not immediately respond to requests for comment by AFP. Women in Pakistan have fought for decades to secure their rights. Much of society lives under a patriarchal, outdated code of so-called ""honour"" that systemises the oppression of women who defy tradition by, for example, choosing their own husband or working outside the home. Women also face what activists have called pervasive violence against them by men, routine discrimination in the workplace, and public harassment, with few women daring to walk alone outside of their homes. The Ariel advert is not the first time a major company has faced backlash in the country over its stance on women's rights. Ride-sharing app Careem came in for its share when it released a lighthearted ad earlier this year showing a runaway bride, the caption reading: ""If you want to run away from your wedding, book a Careem bike!"" Critics filed a legal petition against the ad, calling it an ""unethical promotional campaign"". And in 2016 Pakistani mobile company QMobile was criticised after an ad which showed a female cricketer defying her father's wishes and leaving home to pursue her dreams of playing internationally.

""We do not seek conflict with Iran or any other country,"" Trump said in a brief interaction with reporters at his Oval Office here. ""I can only tell you we cannot ever let Iran have a nuclear weapon,"" he said. Trump said that the executive order signed by him will impose ""hard hitting"" sanction on Iran and it will deny the Iranian Supreme Leader and other officials access to financial instruments. He signed the order in presence of treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin. ""I think a lot of restraint has been shown by us but that doesn't mean we're going to show it in the future,"" Trump said. ""We will continue to increase pressure on Tehran,"" he said. When asked if his executive order was in response to the Iranian attack on US drone, Trump replied ""you could probably add that into this"" but then said, ""this was something that was going to happen anyway."" ""I know many Iranians living in New York, and they're fantastic people,"" Trump said in response to a question. The President's order will deny Iran's leadership access to financial resources and authorises the targeting of persons appointed to certain official or other positions by the Supreme Leader or the Supreme Leader's Office. Moreover, any foreign financial institution that knowingly facilitates a significant financial transaction for entities designated under this Executive Order could be cut off from the US financial system. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement that ""this action was taken as part of the administration's maximum pressure campaign against the Iranian regime which has engaged in 40 years of terror and aggression against the United States and our allies. Most recently, it targeted a US unmanned aircraft and executed attacks on international shipping"". The Supreme Leader's Office has enriched itself at the expense of the Iranian people. It sits atop a vast network of tyranny and corruption that deprives the Iranian people of the freedom and opportunity they deserve, he said. ""Today's action denies Iran's leadership the financial resources to spread terror and oppress the Iranian people. ""The only path forward is for Iran to negotiate a comprehensive deal that addresses the full range of its destabilising behaviours. Until it does, our campaign of diplomatic isolation and maximum economic pressure will continue. When the Iranian regime decides to forgo violence and meet our diplomacy with diplomacy, it knows how to reach us,"" Pompeo said. Giving details of fresh sanctions, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin told reporters at a White House news conference that it includes actions against eight senior commanders of Navy, Aerospace and Ground Forces of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). ""The United States is targeting those responsible for effectuating the Iranian regime's destructive influence in the Middle East. IRGC commanders are responsible for the Iranian regime's provocative attacks orchestrated in internationally recognised waters and airspace, as well as Iran's malign activities in Syria. ""Treasury will continue to aggressively target the senior leaders and the financial apparatus sustaining this malign activity. This action is a warning to officials at all levels of the IRGC and the rest of the Iranian regime that we will continue to sanction those who export violence, sabotage and terrorism,"" Mnuchin said.

While flagging more sanctions, Trump had also said on Saturday he wanted to make a deal to bolster Iran's economy in an apparent move to defuse tensions following the shooting down of an unmanned US drone this week by the Islamic Republic. Trump has said he aborted a military strike to retaliate for Iran's downing of the drone because it could have killed 150 people. ""Neither Iran nor any other hostile actor should mistake US prudence and discretion for weakness. No one has granted them a hunting license in the Middle East,"" US National Security Adviser John Bolton said on Sunday during a visit to Israel. Iran has said it would respond firmly to any threat against it and warned on Sunday of the risks of a military confrontation. ""If a conflict breaks out in the region, no country would be able to manage its scope and timing,"" Major General Gholamali Rashid said, according to the semi-official news agency Fars. ""The American government must act responsibly to protect the lives of American troops by avoiding misconduct in the region."" Tensions in the region began to worsen significantly when Trump pulled out of a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six powers and reimposed sanctions on the country. The sanctions had been lifted under the pact in return for Tehran curbing its nuclear programme. Iran is feeling the effects of the sanctions, Bolton told reporters, adding Iran would never be allowed nuclear weapons. ""Iran's continued pursuit of nuclear weapons, its threats to exceed the limits set in the failed Iran nuclear deal in the coming days ... are not signs of a nation seeking peace,"" Bolton said. ""Sanctions are biting, and more added last night,"" he said. ""Iran can never have nuclear weapons - not against the USA. and not against the world."" US ally Israel, which has itself long threatened strikes against Iran's disputed nuclear programme, signalled backing for Trump's stance. ""With all due respect to the fact that 150 Iranians were spared a cruel fate, the real major thing is the American policy (which) absolutely serves the interests of the world and of Israel in preventing Iran from getting nuclear weaponry,"" Regional Cooperation Minister Tzachi Hanegbi told Israel Radio. Nuclear deadline running out Tensions in the Gulf can only be addressed politically and priority should be de-escalation and dialogue, a senior United Arab Emirates official said on Sunday. ""Crisis long in the making requires collective attention; primarily to de-escalate and to find political solutions through dialogue and negotiations,"" Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash said in a Twitter post. Iran may further scale back compliance with its nuclear deal in two weeks unless European countries shield it from US sanctions through a trade mechanism, the head of Tehran's Strategic Council on Foreign Relations said. ""If Europeans don't take measures within the 60-day deadline (announced by Iran in May), we will take new steps,"" the semi-official news agency ISNA quoted Kamal Kharazi, a former foreign minister, as saying. ""It would be a positive steps if they put resources in (the planned European trade mechanism) Instex and ...make trade possible,"" Kharazi said. ""We have to see in the next two week whether they only make promises or they take practical steps."" Kharazi was speaking after meeting Britain’s Middle East minister Andrew Murrison, who visited Tehran for ""frank and constructive"" talks and to call for urgent de-escalation in the region, according to the Foreign Office. Meanwhile, Iranian lawmakers chanted ""Death to America"" during a parliament session on Sunday after a speaker accused the United States of being the ""real world terrorist"". ""America is the real terrorist in the world by spreading chaos in countries, giving advanced weapons to terrorist groups, causing insecurity, and still it says 'Come, let's negotiate',"" the parliament's deputy speaker, Masoud Pezeshkian, said at the start of a session broadcast live on state radio. ""Death to America,"" chanted many lawmakers. The chants, often repeated since the 1979 Islamic revolution which toppled the US-backed Shah, came weeks after Trump said in a US television interview: ""They (Iranians) haven't screamed 'death to America' lately.""

Why was this? Because even though his 'Black Holes are mortal' theory is now firmly accepted in theoretical physics, there was no way to verify it, wrote Timothy Ferris, author of 'The Science of Liberty', in National Geographic magazine. ""The problem was that there was no way to verify the idea. Black holes are too long-lived to be observed today in their death throes,"" said Ferris.

""But that won't happen for billions of years, not until the first star-size black holes start exploding,"" explained Ferris.

Hyogo prefectural police said Yoshitane Yamasaki was arrested on Saturday and handed over to prosecutors on Monday for further investigation. Yamasaki acknowledged to police that he had kept his son, now 42, in the cage inside a hut next to his home in Hyogo prefecture in western Japan until January, when he turned himself in to city officials. He was seeking advice on nursing care for his wife, but revealed what he had done to his son, police said. The officials visited his home and found the son sitting on a toilet sheet for pets inside the cage, which was slightly bigger than a coffin. He was exposed from the waist down, though Yamasaki told officials it wasn't usually the case and that he had bathed and fed his son every other day. Yamasaki told police he started confining his son when he became violent years ago. Japanese media said the son was caged for more than 20 years, but police would not confirm that number. Due to years of confinement in the 1-meter (3-foot) -high cage in which he could not stand up, the son's back was bent and he was nearly blind because of infections from the filthy conditions, according to the Yomiuri newspaper and other Japanese media reports. Police said they were still investigating and declined to give details about the son's condition, except to say that he had no life-threatening injuries or illness, and has since been cared for by a welfare center. Police are also looking into whether neighbors did not notice his confinement and why it was unreported for so long if he had been violent and noisy.

The man, identified only by his surname Chen, was waiting to leave the flight at Mianyang airport in the southwestern province of Sichuan when he decided he could do with some fresh air. Unfortunately for him, the handle he pulled was attached to the emergency exit and not only did the hatch come free from the plane, but it also activated the escape slide, the Hong Kong- based South China Morning Post reported quoting a Thepaper.cn report yetaerday. Chen, 25, who was returning from the island of Hainan, insisted he did not know that it was an escape route, adding: ""Because it was so stuffy, so hot on the plane, I just pushed down on the window handle beside me. When the door fell out, I panicked."" The crew alerted police and he was detained for 15 days for the unauthorised removal of aviation facilities. He will also be fined 70,000 yuan ($11,000) to cover the airline's costs. The airline, which was not named in the report, said it would cooperate with public security agencies in their investigation. This is the latest in a string of safety incidents in recent years involving Chinese travellers opening emergency exits. In April 2016 a 30-year-old bulldozer driver, who had never travelled by air before, ignored warnings by cabin crew and opened the emergency exit door to get some fresh air just before his flight took off from Shenzhen airport in the south of the country. The man, who said he was worried about getting air sick, was detained for a week and fined 500 yuan after the flight was delayed for an hour. The previous year a man who said he thought the emergency escape handle was a handrail was given 10 days' detention and a second passenger was given a similar sentence for opening an escape hatch while waiting to board a flight at Nanjing airport. China's civil aviation industry has responded by imposing a slew of penalties, including flying bans in addition to existing fines, on blacklisted travellers, the Post report said.

The 19A was the main election pledge of Sirisena when he challenged former president Mahinda Rajapaksa as the opposition's common candidate in 2015. Rajapaksa in 2010 had moved the 18A which allowed him to contest presidency any number of times by lifting the then existing two-term bar. Sirisena in 2015 introduced the 19A which reduced the presidential term for five years while taking away his absolute control over the dissolution of Parliament. The 19A has also barred two term presidents from running for a third time. However, the President addressing a gathering here on Sunday blamed the 19th Amendment for the political instability in the country. ""It has been four years since we formed the government. It is time to conduct a post-mortem with only four months to go before the next election,"" he said, addressing a gathering here today. ""The biggest mistake of this government was the 19 Amendment. It created instability,"" Sirisena said. ""People accuse us of running an unstable government. They say that me and prime minister (Ranil Wickremesinghe) are pulling in different directions...the reason is the 19A,"" he said. Sirisena was made to introduce 19A as a concerted civil society action to make the presidency accountable to people. The reform process was expected to lead to a new Constitution by abolishing the presidential system – a long held demand since it was enacted in 1978. Sirisena's term would now end in January 2020 and the next presidential election would have to be announced in November, 2019. Sri Lanka, which is still recovering from the deadly Easter attacks, saw an unprecedented power struggle between the president and the prime minister. President Sirisena's dramatic move to sack Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and install former strongman Rajapaksa in his place following differences over policy issues, left the country without a functioning government for nearly two months. Wickremesinghe was reinstated following the Supreme Court's intervention.

Internet on mobile phones and fixed land connections was cut across Sudan by the ruling military council, with users saying it was done to prevent further mobilisation of protesters. Lawyer Abdelazim al-Hassan said he had filed a petition against the blockade, and on Sunday a court in Khartoum ordered that the services be resumed.

""Regarding social media, we see during this period that it represents a threat for the security of the country and we will not allow that,"" military council spokesman General Shamseddine Kabbashi said earlier this month. The internet blockade was an attempt to quell new protests against the generals, who have so far resisted to hand power to a civilian administration as demanded by demonstrators, protest leaders say. Tens of thousands of protesters were mobilised through online social media apps during the months-long campaign against the now ousted leader Omar al-Bashir. Protest leaders have resorted to neighbourhood campaigns to keep their movement alive, with activists mobilising supporters in night-time gatherings, witnesses said.

The Garzweiler lignite coal mine has been the focal point of environmental protests in Germany's Rhineland region since Friday, when 40,000 students rallied for more government action against climate change in the nearby city of Aachen. ""We wrote climate history this weekend,'' the activist group End of Story said as it halted the protest. ""Our movement has never been so diverse and never been so determined.'' The long-planned protests began on Friday just hours after European Union leaders failed at a summit to agree on how to make the EU carbon neutral by 2050. On Saturday, some demonstrators blocked the railroad tracks used to transport coal before others broke through a police cordon to enter the mine. Protesters and police accused each other of combative behavior in the mine and of causing injuries. Police said eight officers were injured in scuffles with protesters. Police cut the locks the protesters had used to chain themselves to the railway tracks and then carried the protesters out one by one. Inside the mine, some protesters left voluntarily, while others were taken on buses and driven out of the mine. Police took the identities of all demonstrators before letting them go. German news agency dpa reported that activists claimed police had denied water and food to those who were temporarily detained. Police denied the allegation. The mine has been the focus of many protests in recent years because the operator, German utility company RWE, planned to cut down a forest to enlarge it. Later Sunday, Aachen police tweeted that RWE had filed a criminal complaint against those protesters who had locked themselves to the tracks. The utility company had stopped mining during the three days of protests. Following months of climate protests by students and a sharp rise in the polls for Germany's Greens party, German Chancellor Angela Merkel recently threw her weight behind the goal of making Germany climate neutral by 2050. That would mean the country's economy no longer would add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Scientists say ending fossil fuel use by mid-century is a must if countries want to achieve the 2015 Paris climate accord's most ambitious goal of keeping global temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) compared to pre-industrial times.

An Israeli minister called a major piece of the White House's ""peace to prosperity'' plan ""irrelevant,"" while Jordan and Egypt restated their support for a political solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, pouring cold water on Washington's focus on economic issues. The $50 billion economic plan, published on Saturday, calls for massive infrastructure projects and job creation for Palestinians. It makes no mention of Palestinian political aspirations - a state in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, lands Israel captured in 1967. The plan does not address the core issues of the conflict: the contested holy city of Jerusalem, sought by both peoples as a capital; the fate of more than 5 million Palestinian refugees and their descendants; and the borders of a future Palestinian state. American officials say these issues will not be raised at this week's conference in Bahrain. Neither Israel nor the Palestinians will have official representation at the two-day summit.

Speaking on Sunday in an interview with Israeli public radio, Cabinet minister Tzachi Hanegbi said one of the proposals in the Trump plan- a land link connecting the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip - was ""irrelevant'' so long as the Hamas militant group controls the latter. The Trump administration's outline calls for ""a major road and, potentially, a modern rail line'' between the West Bank and Gaza, saying this would ""reduce the complications of travel for Palestinians'' and stimulate commerce. ""It will be relevant when Gaza will stop being a pro-Iranian terror kingdom, meaning it's irrelevant today and in the foreseeable future,'' said Hanegbi, Israel's minister for regional cooperation and an ally of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The 10-year plan calls for projects worth $6.3 billion for Palestinians in Lebanon, as well as $27.5 billion in the West Bank and Gaza, $9.1 billion in Egypt and $7.4 billion in Jordan. Lebanon's Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri said on Sunday that the country will not be ""tempted'' by money into what he said amounts to giving up Palestinian rights. Berri said in a statement carried by the state-run National News Agency that although Lebanon is currently dealing with an economic crisis, it would be a mistake to think that billions of dollars could convince the government to abandon Palestinians' rights as refugees. Sufian Qudah, a spokesman for Jordan's Foreign Ministry, said that while Jordan would attend the conference, ""no economic proposal can replace a political settlement to the conflict which must be resolved according to the two-state solution.''

Polls conducted for the Mail on Sunday newspaper before and after front page reports of the argument showed that Johnson's lead over rival Jeremy Hunt, the foreign minister, had evaporated amongst all voters and had narrowed among Conservatives. Johnson declined to answer questions about the incident at a hustings event in Birmingham, in central England, on Saturday, saying that the audience wanted instead to hear about his plans for Britain three years after the country voted to leave the European Union. International trade secretary, Liam Fox, who is backing Hunt, agreed the reports should not distract from important policy debate in the race to become the next Prime Minister which will be decided by 160,000 Conservative party members next month. ""I think it's always easier to just give an explanation,"" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday. ""But the key thing then is how you get on to the issues; what we can't have is it being a distraction from explanations about wider polices and where we go to and when."" The clear favourite, Johnson had tried to stay out of the limelight, and opponents have accused him of running from scrutiny to avoid the gaffes that have been a feature of his career so far. Loud altercation Polling for the Mail on Sunday newspaper showed Johnson was seen as the best Prime Minister by 36% of all voters on Thursday, while Jeremy Hunt was supported by 28%. But Johnson had lost the lead on Saturday, with 32% supporting Hunt and 29% Johnson. Among Conservative voters, Johnson's lead fell from 55% to 45%, while Hunt's standing rose from 28% to 34%, the polls conducted by Survation showed. Police were called to an address in south London where Johnson is living with girlfriend Carrie Symonds in the early hours of Friday morning after neighbours heard a loud altercation. Johnson, 55, is currently divorcing his second wife. All occupants of the address were spoken to and were all safe and well, police said in a statement. Johnson supporters have said the action of a neighbour in releasing a recording of the row to the Guardian newspaper was politically motivated. Neighbour Tom Penn, 29, said in a statement he had called the police because he was ""frightened and concerned for the welfare of those involved"". ""Once clear that no one was harmed, I contacted the Guardian, as I felt it was of important public interest,"" he said. ""I believe it is reasonable for someone who is likely to become our next Prime Minister to be held accountable for all of their words, actions and behaviours."" Penn said voted to remain the European Union three years ago, but that was the extent of his involvement in politics. Johnson, who has a leading Brexit campaigner in the 2016 referendum, on Saturday reiterated his desire to leave the European Union in October with or without a deal. Hunt, who backed Remain in the referendum, said he would take the country out of the EU without a deal on October 31 if the EU had not showed it was willing to renegotiate the Brexit deal.

An Israeli minister called a major piece of the White House's ""peace to prosperity'' plan ""irrelevant,"" while Jordan and Egypt restated their support for a political solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, pouring cold water on Washington's focus on economic issues. The $50 billion economic plan, published on Saturday, calls for massive infrastructure projects and job creation for Palestinians. It makes no mention of Palestinian political aspirations - a state in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, lands Israel captured in 1967. The plan does not address the core issues of the conflict: the contested holy city of Jerusalem, sought by both peoples as a capital; the fate of more than 5 million Palestinian refugees and their descendants; and the borders of a future Palestinian state. American officials say these issues will not be raised at this week's conference in Bahrain. Neither Israel nor the Palestinians will have official representation at the two-day summit. The US delegation is to be led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The Trump administration said it did not invite Israeli officials in order to keep the conference apolitical.

Xi will attend the 14th Group of 20 (G-20) summit in Osaka, Japan from June 27 to 29, at the invitation of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lu Kang said in a brief announcement here on Sunday. Ahead of their planned meeting, Trump and Xi held a detailed telephone talk on June 18 preparing ground to resolve differences impeding the deal to end the year long trade war between the world's two largest economies. Trump, who kicked off the trade war last year, is demanding China to reduce the massive trade deficit which climbed to over $539 billion last year. He is also insisting on China to workout verifiable measures for protection of intellectual property rights (IPR), technology transfer and more access to American goods to Chinese markets. Both the countries have imposed additional tariffs on billions of dollars worth of their exports to each other. Trump last week threatened to ""immediately"" jack up tariffs on the remaining $300 billion Chinese exports to US should president Xi fail to show up at the meeting. The US already has 25 per cent duties on more than $250 billion of imports from China. Special teams from both the sides headed by high level officials held 11 rounds of talks to end the tariff war. The talks reportedly broke down after Trump's insistence of verifiable measures to ensure Chinese action to halt IPR violations as well as technology transfer, which Beijing says impedes its sovereignty. After his phone talks with Xi, Trump sounded upbeat about the likely progress in his meeting with Xi at Osaka. ""Had a very good telephone conversation with president Xi of China. We will be having an extended meeting next week at the G-20 in Japan. Our respective teams will begin talks prior to our meeting,"" Trump said. For his part, Xi too said, ""I am ready to meet with the president (Trump) during the G-20 Osaka Summit to exchange views on fundamental issues concerning the development of China-US relations,"" an official statement here said after the telephonic conversation between the two leaders. Xi stressed that on economic and trade issues, the two sides should solve their problems through dialogue on an equal footing, with the key being to accommodate each other's reasonable concerns. ""The Chinese side hopes the US side can treat Chinese firms in a fair manner. I agree to have the two countries' trade teams maintain contact on how to solve the dispute,"" he said. ""As the world's two biggest economies, China and the US should jointly play a leading role in pushing for positive outcomes at the G20 Osaka Summit, so as to inject confidence and vitality into the global market,"" Xi said. Ahead of his meeting with Trump, Xi made a sudden visit to North Korea, the first by a Chinese president in 14 years - amid speculation that the trip was aimed at demonstrating China's clout over North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un to the US leader. Trump, who already had two failed summits with Kim, in the past accused Xi of ""influencing"" the North Korean leader against working out a deal to give up nuclear weapons. During his just concluded visit to North Korea, Xi told Kim that China was determined to support the country's new ""strategic path"", while Kim said Pyongyang had taken steps towards denuclearisation, but it had not received a ""positive response from the relevant party"". Lim Eul-chul, a North Korea expert at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies at Kyungnam University in Seoul, said the situation was becoming ""very complicated"". ""I read China's vow to North Korea as Beijing's determination to align with Pyongyang against Washington,"" Lim told Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post. Zhao Tong, a fellow at the Carnegie Nuclear Policy Programme at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Centre for Global Policy, said the emphasis on historical bonds and the rapprochement between China, Russia and North Korea would prompt suspicion from the West. ""China and Russia are becoming closer as they share similar views on governance and international relations. China, Russia and North Korea will also edge closer as their ideology is similar – and there will be a backlash from the United States and its allies,"" Zhao said. ""Pyongyang will have to manoeuvre between China and the US to survive, and that will inevitably result in a shift in the power dynamic,"" Zhao told the Post.

The long-raging territorial conflicts and the protracted dispute between the two global economic powerhouses are high on the agenda in the final of two days of meetings of leaders from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. It's an annual summit steeped in diplomacy, protocol and cultural color in the Thai capital. Facing regional predicaments such as the Rohingya refugee crisis in Myanmar, the leaders took the stage and clasped their hands together in a trademark ASEAN handshake to project unity. Founded in 1967 in Bangkok in the Cold War era, the diverse 10-nation bloc lumps together an absolute monarchy and constitutional monarchies, along with socialist republics and fledgling democracies. This year's host, Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, opened the summit with a call for regional unity and a push for the bloc to conclude a massive free trade pact with China and five other Asia-Pacific nations to cushion any impact from America's trade conflicts with China. ""The winds of protectionism that are battering the multilateral system remind us that we must hang on ever stronger to one another,"" Prayuth said. The U.S., which has pursued bilateral deals over multination trade accords under President Donald Trump, is not included in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP, which Prayuth said would encompass the world's largest free-trade region. Officials from Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam will be at the G-20 summit later this month in Japan, where Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to meet, and express the region's concerns. ""ASEAN hopes there will be discussions that lead to an easing and resolution of these problems because they affect many countries,"" Prayuth said. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte told other leaders on Saturday that the trade conflict between Washington and Beijing ""is creating uncertainty. It is taking a toll on global growth and it could hinder the ongoing processes of economic integration."" ""The US and China must both take the high road and resolve their differences before the situation spirals out of control,"" the usually blunt Duterte said. In their public communiques, the leaders have avoided naming the US and China or specific nations embroiled in controversial issues in a show of their conservative protocols. The leaders, however, could raise thorny issues in a closed-door and informal session. Duterte has said he would raise the territorial conflicts in the South China Sea following the June 9 ramming of an anchored Philippine boat by a larger Chinese fishing vessel in the disputed Reed Bank. The incident sparked an outcry and condemnations in the Philippines after the Chinese crew sailed away while the fishing boat sank at night. Its Filipino crew was rescued by a Vietnamese vessel. Known for his close ties with China, Duterte has backed Beijing's initial assertion that the collision was accidental. He mocked calls for him to immediately take drastic actions and agreed to a joint investigation with China, which critics have opposed. In a statement outlining their regional policies, the leaders on Sunday renewed their call for countries involved in the territorial spats to ""exercise self-restraint in the conduct of activities and avoid actions that may further complicate the situation, and pursue the peaceful resolution of disputes in accordance with international law."" Four ASEAN states - the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei - along with Taiwan and China are locked in disputes over the strategic waterway. ASEAN has been in talks with China to negotiate a nonaggression pact called the ""code of conduct"" to prevent major armed clashes in the offshore region, which has long been regarded as a potential Asian flashpoint. Southeast Asian diplomats have told The Associated Press that the first of three rounds of talks on the proposed pact was expected to be completed this year. The more difficult aspects, including whether the pact should be legally binding and cover the entire disputed region, have been relegated to the final rounds so as not to stall the talks early on. While China has praised the negotiations as a show of Asian nations' ability to manage their conflicts peacefully, critics doubt if such a code of behavior can make a difference given Beijing's increasingly aggressive assertion of its claims in the strategic waters. They cite China's construction of islands on seven disputed reefs in recent years despite it being a party to a 2002 non-binding regional agreement discouraging such actions. China initially claimed some of the islands would serve as storm shelters for fishermen but Beijing instead installed defensive missile systems there and its naval forces shoo away and warn ships and aircraft that stray near.

The rally in Letna park was the culmination of a series of demonstrations in recent weeks against Babis, who has faced investigations over alleged fraud and conflicts of interest. Organisers said they believed that about 250,000 people had attended Sunday's rally, from all around the country, but this figure could not be verified. Some carried banners saying ""Resign"", ""We've had enough"", and others waved Czech or EU flags. Many families brought children to the protest, which was peaceful so far as were other recent protests against both Babis and his justice minister. Police proposed in April that Babis, a billionaire businessman-turned-politician sometimes likened to U.S. President Donald Trump, should be formally charged for fraud in tapping a European Union subsidy a decade ago to build a hotel and conference centre outside Prague. He denies any wrongdoing. The appointment of a new justice minister just after the police announcement prompted rallies by demonstrators suspicious that Babis was trying to influence proceedings. Babis has also vigorously denied that claim. Filip Rubas, who joined protests in 1989 against the then communist regime, said he turned out on Sunday to send a message to politicians that they will be held accountable. ""We think that our leaders need to be reminded very strongly that they do not own our country, that they are not above the law (or constitution) and that there are still enough caring people who are not brainwashed by hateful propaganda,"" said Rubas, 50. He travelled to the rally with his wife and a group of friends from Brno, the country's second city, 200km from Prague. Sunday's protest was organised by civic group Million Moments for Democracy, founded by students. Politicians were not invited to speak at the rally which began at around 16.30 (1430 GMT). Babis suffered another setback from leaked preliminary results of an audit by the European Commission, which determined he is in conflict of interest as the beneficiary of trust funds where he had transferred his business valued at $3.7 billion by Forbes. Babis insists the audit is wrong and this would be proven in the final conclusions, expected late this year or early in 2020. Babis has said people have the right to protest but has firmly refused to step down. His populist ANO movement remains the most popular party, although its support has dipped slightly in the past two months to 27.5%, according to a poll by Kantar agency released on June 9. Babis also has enough backing in parliament, where a no-confidence vote planned for the next week is likely to fail.

The Idlib region of some three million people is supposed to be protected by a September buffer zone deal, but the jihadist-run enclave has come under mounting bombardment by the government and its ally Russia since late April. An air raid by Damascus aircraft on Sunday killed five civilians, including two sisters under the age of 10, in the village of Josef in Idlib province, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The strikes also wounded several people, some of whom were in serious condition, said the Observatory. Since Wednesday, more than 60 civilians have been killed in regime air raids in the surrounding anti-government enclave, the Britain-based monitoring group says. Since the start of the escalation in late April, more than 470 civilians have died in regime and Russian bombardment there. In addition, 780 rebel and jihadist fighters and more than 610 pro-regime fighters have died in raids and clashes on the ground. The violence has forced around 330,000 people to flee their homes and hit 23 health centres, the United Nations says. The September deal signed by Russia and rebel backer Turkey was supposed to set up a buffer zone around the Idlib region, but the accord was never fully implemented as jihadists refused to pull back from the front lines. In January, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham -- an alliance led by Syria's former Al-Qaeda affiliate -- took over administrative control of the region, which is made up of a large part of the Idlib province and slivers of neighbouring governorates. The Syria conflict has killed more than 370,000 people and displaced millions since it erupted in 2011 with the brutal repression of protests against President Bashar al-Assad.

The women come to the UK after arranged marriages in Pakistan and often raise children before their husbands or in-laws get tired of them or decide they are no longer of use, 'The Sunday Times' reported. The women are reportedly tricked into returning to Pakistan for a holiday or to see a sick relative. They are then abruptly divorced and discarded thousands of miles away from their children, who grow up being told their mother is dead, mentally ill or chose to desert them, the report said. According to research collated from law firms and charities, the newspaper estimates that at least 1,000 cases of Pakistani wives have been abandoned since 2002. The UK Home Office routinely blocks mothers who try to re-enter the country, it found. Most came to the country on a spousal visa, which their husbands can cancel simply by notifying immigration authorities that the marriage has broken down. ""It is the most vile form of misogyny to abandon women once they have been used for their reproductive capacity. The Home Office must treat this as what it is: domestic violence and trafficking of women who gave up everything to build lives here,"" said Naz Shah, Labour Party's shadow women's and equalities minister, who is currently dealing with a case of an abandoned Pakistani woman. Since 2017, family courts in the UK categorise abandonment as a form of domestic violence, but it is not a criminal offence. While domestic abuse survivors are entitled to reside in the UK permanently, they can apply only from in the country.

Reacting to India's statement on Saturday calling for verifiable and irreversible action by Pakistan against terrorism, Pakistan had accused India of politicising the FATF deliberations and expressed hope that the members would reject India's ""malicious campaign"". India is hoping though that the FATF members will ensure Pakistan implements the FATF Action Plan fully within the September 2019 time limit by taking credible, verifiable, irreversible and sustainable measures to curb terror funding and terrorism emanating from territory under its control, and not use what India sees as a false ploy of politicisation of the FATF process. India has repeatedly said in the recent past that it won't be fooled by any cosmetic action against terrorism. It has sought to further pile on the pressure on Islamabad by refusing to have any bilateral engagement with the Imran Khan-led government. To India, Pakistan's position is meant to deflect attention and evade scrutiny of its poor compliance of global standards on AML/CFT (anti-money laundering/ combating financial terrorism) and hoodwink the global community. The main reason why India sees Pakistan's statement as a red herring thrown into the FATF process is the campaign by its foreign minister S M Qureshi to seek support from countries like China, Malaysia, Turkey and Russia to prevent Pakistan's blacklisting. The government seems to have closely followed recent reports in Pakistani media which show that Pakistani leadership has approached political leadership of the FATF member countries at the highest level to seek their support. This, in India's understanding, is clearly politicising the technical process of the FATF. Qureshi was said to have visited many FATF member countries before the Orlando plenary. He also made statements about how he was using diplomacy to overcome the technical deficiencies pointed out by FATF. These attempts to garner support for Pakistan are seen by India as politicization of the FATF process, a bogey apparently meant to evade scrutiny of its poor compliance of global standards on AML/CFT since 2010. At its Orlando meet last week, the FATF had strongly urged Pakistan to swiftly complete its action plan by October 2019 when the last set of action plan items are set to expire. ""Otherwise, the FATF will decide the next step at that time for insufficient progress,"" it warned, suggesting that Pakistan could face blacklisting finally.

Asked on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" whether he thought impeachment was good politics for him, Trump replied, ""I think I win the election easier."" The president repeated his longstanding allegation that the FBI's counterintelligence investigation into his 2016 campaign was illegal. ""I was spied on. What they did to me was illegal. It was illegal on the other side. I did nothing wrong,"" he said. ""So impeachment's a very unfair thing because nothing that I did was wrong. And if you look at the Mueller report, there was no collusion. This was all about collusion."" The Democrats are split over whether Trump should be impeached after the Mueller Report into Russian interference in the 2016 election outlined numerous contacts between his campaign and Russians, as well as evidence that the president tried on several occasions to stymie the investigation. While many of the candidates for the Democratic nomination are pro-impeachment, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has argued that it would be a risky move without an ""ironclad"" case and bipartisan support. Trump told ""Meet the Press"" Pelosi was staving off growing impeachment calls from within the Democratic caucus because she agreed with his assessment that it would harm their prospects in 2020. ""I think she feels that I will win much easier,"" Trump said. ""I mean, I've been told that by many people."" Former special counsel Robert Mueller spent nearly two years investigating Russian election interference and possible involvement by Trump and his inner circle. He concluded that there wasn't sufficient proof of a criminal conspiracy but found that Trump's campaign welcomed and expected to benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts.

Outlining the hardline position that critics say takes its cue from a like-minded hardline constituency in Israel, Trump accused Obama of making a “desperate and terrible deal with Iran.” Obama, he alleged, “gave them 150 Billion Dollars plus I.8 Billion Dollars in CASH!

The US President’s tirade came even as he dialed down talk of war in a message to Iran routed through Oman and sought talks with Tehran, which warned that any attack against it will have regional and international consequences. In earlier remarks at the White House, Trump was exculpatory towards the Iranian leadership, saying the unmanned US drone may have been shot down in error by someone who was acting ""loose and stupid,” possibly a general, and he had a ""big, big feeling"" that someone made a mistake. ""We didn't have a man or woman in the drone. It would have made a big, big difference,"" Trump said, adding, ""This country will not stand for it, that I can tell you."" Iran though claimed the US drone was in its territory and that it in fact it had issued two warnings to the Americans before shooting the spy plane down eight miles from its shores. Trump met with congressional leaders - many of whom are leery of the perceived US warmongering - at the White House on Thursday afternoon. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority leader Chuck Schumer, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell were among those who attended the meeting, which comes amid a reckoning that only Congress is mandated to declare war and Trump has get legislative approval before ordering a full-fledged war. ""The president may not intend to go to war here, but we are worried that he and the administration may bumble into a war.

Iran has denied any involvement in those incidents. Tensions began to worsen significantly when Trump pulled out of a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six powers and reimposed sanctions on the country. The sanctions had been lifted under the pact in return for Tehran curbing its nuclear programme. Iran has threatened to breach the deal if the European signatories to the deal fail to salvage it by shielding Tehran from US sanctions.

A man and a woman, named only as the owner and supervisor of the workshop, were arrested in North Sumatra's capital Medan shortly after the fire ripped through a rented home that operated as a lighter factory in the town of Binjai, about 70 kilometres (44 miles) west of the capital. Local police chief Nugroho Tri Nuryanto told AFP the pair were being investigated for ""negligence"" and could face up to five years in prison. The business was initially reported as a matchstick factory but an investigation revealed it was actually producing lighters. Fire broke out in the factory when a worker was conducting a test for the product. The gas lighter exploded and the panicked worker threw it on a pile of thousands of ready-to-pack products, triggering a massive explosion. Victims trapped inside could not escape because the front door was locked and the fire spread quickly because most of the house structures were made of wood. Twenty-five workers -- all female -- died in the accident. Five children -- four girls and one boy -- also died in the blaze. All victims were local residents who lived near the factory while the owner and supervisor only came to monitor the business once a month, Nuryanto said. ""We are still investigating why children were allowed to be in such dangerous place and why the door was locked,"" he said adding police suspected the factory was operating illegally because the suspects could not provide any documents to prove the factory has the necessary permits. One of four workers who survived -- because they were outside during the incident -- said that the children were visiting their parents who worked at the site. Grief-stricken relatives have been flocking to a hospital in Medan to have their DNA samples taken for the identification process because all victims were badly burned and hard to recognise. Deadly fires are not uncommon in Indonesia due to poor safety standards that are routinely flouted, while illegal businesses are also widespread. This year, dozens were believed to have been killed when an unlicensed gold mine collapsed while, in 2017, at least 46 people were killed and dozens more injured in a blaze that tore through a fireworks factory outside Jakarta. Seventeen people were killed when a fire ripped through a karaoke bar on Sulawesi island in 2015 and, in 2009, a fire killed 20 people at a karaoke bar in Medan, on Sumatra island.

The announcement by foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard comes as Mexico puts into effect a deal on irregular immigration reached with Washington to head off stiff tariffs that President Donald Trump threatened to slap on all imports from Mexico. A Mexican official who was not authorised to speak about the deployment and requested anonymity said the National Guard agents have not been visible in large contingents because they are spread along the southern border that stretches more than 600 miles (1,000 kilometers) and as well as up Mexico's southern isthmus. They were also deployed to remote areas to target human smugglers, the official said. The Associated Press witnessed an operation near the town of Comitán last weekend, when members of the new militarised policing force patrolled dirt roads through jungle in the dark. The National Guard has not reappeared on the banks of the Suchiate river across from Guatemala in Ciudad Hidalgo since early in the week. Migrants continued crossing on rafts early Friday morning. National Guard agents have been spotted intermittently in southern states supporting immigration officials at highway checkpoints. On Friday, checkpoints near Tapachula on the main highway connecting Mexico to Guatemala operated as they have been in recent weeks. Immigration officials stopped public transport vans and taxis to ask passengers for their documents while the National Guard or military police looked on. While the bulk of the migrant traffic has been Central Americans, authorities find people from all over the world. At a checkpoint on the outskirts of Tapachula on Friday, more than 20 migrants from Pakistan, India and Bangladesh were detained. Last weekend, authorities found nearly 800 migrants inside four semi-trailers traveling through the Gulf coast state of Veracruz. Officials have said they want to focus efforts on disrupting migrant smuggling operations. Since January, Mexico has detained more than 74,000 migrants and deported over 53,000, according to the latest figures available. That is expected to rise when June numbers are released. UNICEF executive director Henrietta Fore said in a statement following a three-day visit to Mexico that 15,500 migrant minors were registered by Mexican migration authorities between January and April, mostly from Central America's Northern Triangle countries. That was a 50 per cent increase over the same period last year.

One candidate of sub-Saharan African descent wants to improve race relations in a country where activists estimate tens of thousands of people still live in slavery despite the practice being banned by the government for decades. Amnesty International has called on the next president to end rampant human rights abuses in this coastal Saharan nation of 4.5 million people. ""Anyone who dares to stand up against slavery, discrimination and other human rights violations and abuses is at risk of arbitrary arrest, unlawful detention and even torture,'' said Kine Fatim Diop, a West Africa campaigner for the rights organization. Mauritania has suffered five coups since independence from France in 1960 and has been led by military rulers for much of that time. President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz himself was head of the presidential guard when he seized power in a 2008 coup. He said he did so to prevent a return to repressive military rule. He won a landslide election the following year in what opponents called a fraudulent ``electoral coup.'' Most opposition parties then boycotted the 2014 election in which Aziz won 82 percent of the vote according to official results. The president is barred by the constitution from seeking another term. In respecting term limits instead of seeking to change the constitution he contrasts with several leaders elsewhere in Africa in recent years. His successor of choice is former Defense Minister Mohamed Ould El Ghazouani, a retired general who served as chief of staff of Mauritania's armed forces. Ghazouani was chosen by the ruling majority as a presidential candidate after his retirement. He has campaigned on his security credentials and the outgoing president's record on fighting Islamic extremists. Mauritania has to choose between Mohamed Ould El Ghazouani _ who wants to strive toward security, development and progress or vote for a return to insecurity, bad management and corruption where there is hate, racism and destruction of national unity,'' the outgoing president said at a press conference marking the end of campaigning. This moderate Islamic republic borders Mali, where jihadist rule forced tens of thousands to flee the country's north to Mauritania in 2012. While the security situation has deteriorated in Mali even after the extremists were ousted from control, Mauritania has not seen the spillover in violence experienced by Mali's other neighbors Niger and Burkina Faso. Mauritania is a member of the G5 Sahel regional counterterrorism force , which was established in 2017 but has been plagued by funding problems. The opposition candidates in this election include anti-slavery activist Biram Dah Abeid, who was elected to Parliament in September from his prison cell, where he was held on charges his supporters called politically motivated. He was released late last year after serving four months. Mauritania was the last country to abolish slavery, doing so in 1981, but did not criminalize it until 2007. Late last year the United States ended trade benefits with Mauritania, saying the country is not making sufficient progress toward combating forced labor, including slavery. The Mauritanian government, however, denies that slavery is widespread. Candidate Kane Hamidou Baba of the ``Living Together'' coalition is representing parties backed by Mauritanians of sub-Saharan African descent. Other candidates include Sidi Mohamed ould Boubacar, a two-time former prime minister who is supported by the opposition Islamist party; Mohamed ould Maouloud, candidate of the Opposition Coalition for Change and Mohamed Lemine El Mourteji Wafi, who hopes to draw the support of younger Mauritanians.

The conference is to be followed by meetings and working sessions over the next two days, all of which come in the run-up to Afghan President Ashraf Ghani's visit to Pakistan next week. Ghani, his political opponents and a broad swath of Afghan civil society have been holding meetings in recent days with the United States' special envoy to Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, who continues to press for talks between the Afghan government, the opposition and the Taliban. There are no representatives of the Taliban at Saturday's conference, held near the Pakistani capital, Islamabad. However, attending the conference is Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who struck a peace deal with Ghani's government and was taken off a US terrorist list. That peace deal was touted as a blueprint for an agreement with the Taliban, although the insurgents dismissed Hekmatyar as a spent force with no military might. Still, at the outset of Saturday's meeting, Hekmatyar urged his fellow Afghans to press for the Taliban's demand for a quick and full withdrawal of US and NATO troops from Afghanistan. Washington has been holding talks with the Taliban to find a negotiated exit to its 17-year engagement in Afghanistan. On Saturday, Khalilzad was in Doha where the Taliban maintain a political office, but it still wasn't clear when he would meet again with the militants, who control or wield significant influence in nearly half of the country. The Taliban have refused to sit with government representatives but say they will sit with any Afghan, even a government official, but as an ordinary Afghan and not as a government representative. An earlier attempt at Afghan-to-Afghan talks was scuttled after neither side could agree on participants. Among the figures in attendance at Saturday's conference in Pakistan were the head of the Afghan government-sponsored high peace council, Mohammad Karim Khalili, as well as the leader of the powerful Jamiat-e-Islami political party, Ustad Atta Mohammad Noor, and a current presidential candidate, Haneef Atmar, who is a former national security adviser. The event was backed by the Pakistani government and organized by two think tanks, the Lahore Center for Peace Research and the South Asian Strategic Stability Institute. Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi opened the conference by saying his country will continue its efforts toward peace and stability in Afghanistan.

""The execution sentence was carried out for Jalal Haji Zavar, a contractor for the defence ministry's aerospace organisation who spied for the CIA and the American government,"" ISNA reported, quoting the Iranian military. ISNA said he was convicted by Iran's military court and that he was executed, at an unspecified time, at the Rajayi Shahr prison in the city of Karaj, west of Tehran. The agency did not say when Zavar was arrested, noting however that his contract with the defence ministry had been terminated during the Iranian year 1389 (March 2010-2011). He was identified as a spy by the defence ministry's intelligence unit, ISNA said. During the investigation the suspect ""explicitly confessed to spying for the CIA"" in return for money, ISNA said, adding that ""documents and espionage devices were found at his house"". Zavar's ex-wife was convicted of ""involvement in espionage"" and is serving a 15-year jail sentence, the agency said. The report comes days after Iran said it had dismantled a ""new"" US spy network in the country linked to the CIA, amid escalating tensions between Tehran and Washington. In what it termed a ""wide-reaching blow"" to US intelligence, state news agency IRNA said on Tuesday that Tehran had carried out the operation in cooperation with ""foreign allies"", without naming any state. Tensions between Washington and Tehran flared up after Iran, on Tuesday, said it shot down a US ""spy"" drone which violated its airspace -- a claim the US denies -- near the strategic Strait of Hormuz. In response, the US was ready to carry out a military strike against Iran. President Donald Trump said Friday the United States was ""cocked & loaded"" to strike Iran but pulled back at the last minute as it would not have been a ""proportionate"" response to Tehran's shooting down of the unmanned drone. The downing of the drone came after tensions spiked between the two countries following a series of attacks on oil tankers the US has blamed on Iran.

By daybreak, police had cleared the streets of barriers set up by protesters to snarl traffic in the Asian financial centre, and only a few groups in the mostly youthful crowd remained. Many slept outside the legislature. Traffic was again smooth on a major thoroughfare through the government's central complex as the protest movement regrouped to consider next moves. Police said nine female and four male staffers were hospitalized ""with considerable delay"" during the blockade. The police statement did not say whether they were injured in clashes or had otherwise become unwell. Around police headquarters, masked and helmeted protesters covered surveillance cameras with masking tape and lashed barriers together with nylon cable ties. They threw eggs at the building and drew graffiti on the walls. Protesters also ""splashed oil"" and targeted police officers' eyes with laser pointers, according to the police. Hong Kong has been rocked by major protests for the past two weeks over legislative proposals that many view as eroding the territory's judicial independence and, more broadly, as a sign of Chinese government efforts to chip away at the city's freedoms. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam indefinitely suspended debate on the bills a week ago, making it likely they would die. But protesters are demanding that she formally withdraw the proposed changes to the extradition laws, which would expand the scope of criminal suspect transfers to include mainland China, Taiwan and Macau. Some also want Lam to resign. Legal and business groups in Hong Kong oppose the legislation, saying critics of China's ruling Communist Party would be at risk of torture and unfair trials on the mainland and that it further erode the ""one country, two systems"" framework under which Hong Kong has been governed since the handover from British rule in 1997. The peaceful ending to Friday's protests drew a sigh of relief in the city of 7.4 million people, after police unleashed tear gas and rubber bullets last week in violent clashes that left dozens injured on both sides. Police were previously criticized for their use of force but this time waited out the protesters. Police did issue a statement at 4.50 am condemning them for blocking key streets and seriously disrupting work at police headquarters. ""Police have shown the greatest tolerance to the protesters who assembled outside PHQ, but their means of expressing views have become illegal, irrational and unreasonable,"" the statement said in part. Activist Joshua Wong called on police to answer demands over heavy handed tactics used during a mass protest on June 12, including the firing of 150 rounds of tear gas, rubber bullets and beanbag rounds, and the beating of unarmed protesters by police with truncheons. ""We...urge police to apologize to the people"" over the use of such tactics and their labeling of the gathering as a riot, Wong said. The auxiliary bishop of Hong Kong's Catholic Diocese, Joseph Ha, appealed to the protesters to avoid violence. He warned that public opinion could turn against them. ""You have already been on the roads for a long time,"" he said on Cable TV Hong Kong. ""You've already done a lot. You have already expressed very clearly your hopes and wishes. But I am really worried about your personal safety...Please, absolutely, do not use violence."" Since the confrontations of June 12, police have eased their approach, hoping to avoid a replay of 2014 protests, when officers unleashed 87 rounds of tear gas at protesters in the same location as the current protests. When the smoke from that response cleared, bigger crowds returned, angrier than before, and didn't leave for nearly three months. The Communist Party under Chinese President Xi Jinping has been pushing ever more aggressively to quiet independent voices in Hong Kong. Beijing has squelched all reporting on the protests in mainland media and accused foreign forces of stirring up disturbances in Hong Kong. Opposition to the legislation has come from a broad range of civic, human rights, legal profession and commercial organizations. Politicians in the US, the UK and elsewhere have also weighed in, underscoring Hong Kong's status as a global financial center with strong legal guarantees - despite its ultimate control by China's authoritarian leaders. Despite that, Beijing has not come out strongly in favor of ramming through the legislation, perhaps mindful of threats to Hong Kong's special economic status amid a trade war with the US. Under the 1992 US-Hong Kong Policy Act, Beijing needs to abide by its ""one country, two systems"" promises to respect the territory's legal autonomy for 50 years as promised under the agreement signed with Britain for the 1997 handover.

When Khakhar first unveiled ‘Two Men in Benares' in Mumbai in 1986, he became the first Indian artist to freely disclose his sexual orientation through his work and on Monday it went down in the record books for far exceeding its 450,000-600,000 pounds estimate. “Widely considered among the artist's best works, the painting later starred in Tate Modern's 2016 – “You Can't Please All” exhibition of Khakhar's work, the first retrospective of an Indian artist to be held at the [London] institution,” Sotheby's said in a statement. Overall, the auction house's sale of Modern & Contemporary South Asian Art totalled 7,459,000, pounds comfortably exceeding the pre-sale estimate of 4.1-5.8 million pounds. This season's sales opened with the auction of Coups de Coeur: The Guy and Helen Barbier Family Collection, an offering of 29 artworks from one of the finest collections of 20th century Indian art in private hands. Each and every artwork appeared at auction for the first time and the majority of the pieces having been acquired directly from the artists themselves. MF Husain's ‘Marathi Woman' (1950) quadrupled its pre-sale estimate to sell for 435,000 pounds; a rare figurative work by Ram Kumar, ‘Untitled (Man and Woman Holding Hands)' painted as a present for the artist's wife in 1953, sold for 519,000, pounds double its pre-sale estimate; and ‘Anatomy of that Old Story' (1970) from Rameshwar Broota's Ape series also quadrupled its estimate to make 423,000 pounds. “These exceptional results are a fitting tribute to the pioneering spirit of Guy and Helen Barbier, who passionately sought out exceptional examples of Indian art at a time when few others thought to,” said Ishrat Kanga, Head of Sale at Sotheby's. “They collected with a ‘coups de coeur', acquiring works that they truly loved and with a real commitment to discovering and celebrating Indian art. Through the friendships they established with many of the artists they met along the way, they accumulated one of the best collections of its kind, as proven by the lively bidding and competition we saw in the saleroom today,” Kanga said. Across the wider sale on Monday, Francis Newton Souza's monumental ‘Untitled' painting sold for 1.2 million pounds. Described by the artist himself as a “probable masterpiece”, the painting tells the Old Testament story of ‘Susanna and the Elders', in which a young Jewish woman, who refuses the advances of her husband's elderly male guests, is accused of promiscuity and put on trial for her life. In the end, virtue triumphs and the elders are put to death.

The Windrush generation refers to citizens of former British colonies who arrived before 1973, when the rights of such Commonwealth citizens to live and work in Britain were substantially curtailed. While a large proportion of them were of Jamaican/Caribbean descent who came on the ship Windrush, Indians and other South Asians were also affected by the UK government's handling of their immigration status. According to the latest update by UK home secretary Javid on Monday, a total of 737 Indians have been able to confirm their status in the wake of the scandal involving Commonwealth nationals wrongly denied their citizenship rights in Britain. A majority of them (559) had arrived in the UK before 1973, when the immigration rules had changed, while the others either arrived later or were a family member of the so-called “Windrush generation”. ""I have personally apologised to those identified through this review and I will make sure they receive support and access to the compensation scheme,” said Javid, a senior Pakistani-origin minister who took charge of the UK Home Office as a result of the scandal last year. ""I have been very clear that the experiences of some members of the Windrush generation has been completely unacceptable, which is why I am committed to right the wrongs of successive governments,” he said. The UK Home Office had set up a Windrush Taskforce in April 2018 to deal with a backlog of thousands of such cases, with Javid providing regular updates to the Parliament's Home Affairs Select Committee Chair, Yvette Cooper, on the progress of the scheme. In his latest update this week, the minister confirmed that as of the end of April 30 this year, 6,470 individuals have been granted some form of documentation by the Taskforce. He also revealed that he has written 46 letters to people, mainly of Caribbean origin, who were wrongly sanctioned under policies aimed at illegal immigrants. “To right the wrongs experienced by the Windrush generation, the Home Office established the Commonwealth Citizen Taskforce which is open to all nationalities, as is the compensation scheme which opened in April 2019,” a Home Office statement said.

Assange faces an 18-count indictment that accuses him of soliciting and publishing classified information and of conspiring with former Army private Chelsea Manning to crack a defense department computer password. That indictment, which includes Espionage Act charges, was issued by the justice department last month and is pending in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia. The extradition request had been expected ever since US authorities first announced a criminal case against Assange. The 47-year-old Assange was evicted on April 11 from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he had been holed up since 2012 after Ecuador granted him political asylum. He was arrested by British police and is currently serving a 50-week sentence for jumping bail. Sweden also seeks him for questioning about an alleged rape, which Assange has denied. Assange was initially charged with a single computer crime violation on allegations that he worked with Manning to crack a government password. Some legal experts have said the additional Espionage Act charges might slow or complicate the extradition process to the extent the United Kingdom views them as political offenses and therefore exempt from extradition. The US official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official wasn't authorized to speak publicly. Manning, who spent seven years in a military prison for delivering a trove of classified information to Assange before having her sentence commuted by then-President Barack Obama, has been jailed for civil contempt in Virginia after refusing to testify before a grand jury investigating WikiLeaks.

President Sirisena, who is the head of the Cabinet, warned last week that he would not attend the Cabinet unless the government took immediate action to halt the parliamentary investigation. The PSC began hearing testimony from Muslim leaders who said they repeatedly warned the authorities to dangerous radicalisation. The committee summoned former governor of the Western province Azath Sally to testify before it. The cabinet meeting which is usually held on Tuesday mornings was not called by Sirisena, officials said. President Sirisena last week asked the Cabinet to halt the hearings, citing national security concerns. Sirisena said that it was uncalled for and a serious threat to national security as the top intelligence personnel are identified through the media. He said he would not allow any serving defense official to testify before the PSC. He wrote to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya urging a halt to the PSC. Jayasuriya, however, replied that the PSC was a parliamentary issue and it would proceed. Sirisena has insisted that as minister of defence and law and order he was unaware of precise intelligence warnings from India about the attack on April 21. He suspended police chief Pujith Jayasundara and dismissed his top defence official Hemasiri Fernando after it was found that there were intelligence failures before the attacks. Sirisena said that none of the serving officers would be authorised by him to testify in future. Jayasuriya stressed that all officials are bound by parliamentary privileges and they would be compelled to respond to summons by the PSC. Nine suicide bombers, including a woman, carried out a series of devastating blasts that tore through three churches and three high-end hotels frequented by tourists in the country's deadliest violence since the devastating civil war with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ended in 2009. The Islamic State claimed the attacks, but the government blamed local Islamist extremist group National Thawheed Jamaath (NTJ) for the bombings. A three-member committee appointed to probe the attacks that killed 258 people, including 11 Indians, submitted its final report to President Sirisena on Monday. The details of the report were immediately not available. Sirisena's opposition to the PSC has triggered another clash between the executive and the legislature. The president and his coalition partner, prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe are at loggerheads and in October last year the president sacked the premier unconstitutionally. The political and constitutional stand off lasted for nearly two months before Wickremesinghe was ordered to be restored by the Supreme Court.

In the run-up to the FATF plenary in Orlando, Florida from June 16-21, diplomatic sources have said Pakistan will, at the very least, remain in the grey list which it went back into in 2018. After the second review meeting in Guangzhou, China, the Asia-Pacific Joint Group - a committee set up by the FATF to monitor Pakistan's compliance, distinct from the Asia-Pacific Group (APG) - told Islamabad over the weekend that it has to take serious steps to stay off the black list which would mean shutting of all doors to international finance. A third review of Pakistan's compliance will be in September, just before the October plenary. Pakistan was given 15 months to get its act together on a host of issues. It has until October, before FATF decides whether to keep Pakistan on the grey list or blacklist it. India is pushing for Pakistan to be blacklisted. But the opinion among the others is that by keeping Pakistan in the grey list they can continue to pressure Islamabad as well as scrutinise its actions. In 2012-13, when Pakistan was put in the grey list, Islamabad had made the same promises they are making today. After they emerged from the list, Pakistan went right back to its bad old ways. The FATF, diplomatic sources said, do not want a repeat. Pakistan is working overtime to avoid the black list. Some are hoping that Pakistan might get a breather with China taking on the presidentship of FATF from October. But that is unlikely to happen, because of the weight of the other members. So far, Pakistan has seized 800 properties belonging to JUD, FIF, JEM and arrested some of their leaders. But pointing out that seizures do not show compliance, FATF has asked Pakistan to explain certain things, like where is the investigation about the source of funds for these bodies. Secondly, Pakistan has not shown any action against terrorist assets - armouries, weapons, explosives and camps. FATF has asked for more detailed action and reporting on this. Third, FATF has raised the fact that Pakistan's anti-terror laws are not yet in conformity with FATF guidelines.

Pakistan's military, in a rare move, early this month decided to voluntarily cut the defence budget for the next fiscal year and assured the nation that there would be no impact to its ""response potential"" due to the voluntary cut in the budget. Minster of state for revenue Hammad Azhar on Tuesday presented in Parliament the austerity driven budget for fiscal year 2019-20, which starts from July 1. The government unveiled Rs 7,022 billion for the year 2019-20, setting growth target of 4 per cent. ""Defence budget will remain unchanged at Rs 1,150 billion to the level of last year,"" he said. The minister, however, added that it will in no way impact the defence capability of the country because defence of the country is sacred for the government. Earlier, Prime Minister Imran Khan said that there will be no increase in the defence budget of the country for the next fiscal year. Khan made the announcement during Eid holidays and a week before unveiling of national budget for 2019-20 on June 11. He said that army voluntarily agreed to cut its spending due to precarious economic situation. ""I appreciate Pak Mil's unprecedented voluntary initiative of stringent cuts in their defence expenditures for next FY (fiscal year) because of our critical financial situation, despite multiple security challenges,"" he said. I appreciate Pak Mil's unprecedented voluntary initiative of stringent cuts in their defence expenditures for next… https://t.co/EXk1lHlzXU &mdash; Imran Khan (@ImranKhanPTI) 1559671677000 Khan also said that the government will spend the money saved on the development of merged tribal areas and Balochistan. Commenting on Khan's announcement not to increase the defence budget, Army spokesman Major General Asif Ghafoor said that the decision was taken by chief of army staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa. Pakistan in 2018 was the 20th biggest military spender in the world with an expenditure of US $11.4 billion, a report published by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute said in April. Imran Khan's cash-strapped government has negotiated a US $6 billion bailout package from the International Monetary Fund to overcome the financial woes facing the country. The government's budget focused on austerity, growth and tax collection. ""The budget outlay is 30 per cent higher than the previous year. It has set target of Rs 6,717 billion for federal revenue which is 19 per cent higher than previous budget,"" the minister said while presenting the budget. The minister said the total fiscal deficit will be 7.1 per cent of GDP, which is lower than 7.2 per cent of last year. He said the target set for Federal Bureau of Revenue (FBR) was Rs 5,550 billion and the government will take measures to increase tax to GDP ratio to 12.6 per cent. He also announced several changes in tax regime that will generate additional over Rs 700 billion. The minister said that Rs 3,255 billion will be disbursed to provinces from federal resources under a constitutional arrangement which is 32 per cent higher than last year. The minister announced over Rs 1,800 billion for public sector development programme. He announced that civilian expenditures will be reduced by 5 per cent from Rs 460 billion to Rs 437 billion. The minister also said that GST will remain unchanged at 17 percent. Imran Khan attended the budget session and remained in his seat despite protests and slogans raised against him by opposition. Pakistan's opposition parties created ruckus in Parliament during presentation of the budget by the government. They tried to disrupt the speech of Azhar. Members from the opposition parties gathered around treasury benches and raised anti-government slogans. They chanted ""Go Niazi GO"" repeatedly to tease Prime Minister Khan whose surname is Niazi but he seldom use it with his name. The Opposition also tore the copies of budget documents. Earlier, Opposition lawmakers attended the session by wearing black bands as mark of protest against arrest of Opposition leaders. They remained silent and listened the speech for some time but then stood up and started to protest.

The Met police only confirmed that a man in his 60s had been held in an investigation into speeches related to his MQM party. “He was arrested on suspicion of intentionally encouraging or assisting offences contrary to Section 44 of the Serious Crime Act, 2007,” the statement added. His arrest, however, was confirmed by Qasim Raza, his spokesperson. While several complaints were registered against Hussain in UK over his hard-hitting speeches against Pakistan’s military establishment and spy agency Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), the focus of the London Met police was on his speech in August 2016. A police team had visited Islamabad in April this year to gather evidence and interview key persons related to Hussain’s 2016 speech. On August 22, 2016, Hussain, while addressing MQM workers protesting outside Karachi Press Club against enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings of his party’s workers, had not only raised anti-Pakistan slogans but also called the country “a cancer for the entire world”. “Pakistan is a cancer for the entire world. Pakistan is a headache for the entire world. Pakistan is the epicentre of terrorism for the entire world. Who says long live Pakistan... it’s down with Pakistan,” the MQM founder had said. Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, Pakistan’s interior minister at the time, had sought assistance from British authorities, asking them to take action against Hussain for inciting the people of Pakistan to violence. The MQM has dominated politics in Pakistan’s southern port city of Karachi for three decades. Previously known as the Mohajir Qaumi Movement, Hussain’s party had started off as a political group aiming to represent the Urdu-speaking community, descendants of people who migrated from India when Pakistan was created in 1947. His political career began during his student years in Karachi University when he and Azeem Ahmed Tariq had founded the All-Pakistan Mohajir Students Organisation (APMSO). Within a short period of time, APMSO gained a massive following and under Hussain’s leadership MQM swept the 1988 election in the urban areas of Karachi and Hyderabad, in Sindh, emerging as the third-largest party in Pakistan. In the early 1990s, the then government had launched an operation against MQM in Karachi, accusing it and its chief of using violent tactics to attain and retain political power. Hussain went into exile in 1992 after his arrest warrant was issued in a murder case and later gained UK citizenship. Despite a split in the MQM, he still wields considerable influence in the party and its main power base, Karachi. From self-imposed exile in London Hussain would address crowds of supporters of his party in Pakistan via the telephone till 2016 when broadcasts of his speeches were banned by the state.

Pompeo would leave for New Delhi on June 24, State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus told reporters on Monday. His visit will take place ahead of a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Osaka, Japan on June 28-29. New Delhi would be Pompeo's first stop and South Korea his last during the nearly week-long visit to the Indo-Pacific region, beginning June 24, that would also take him to Sri Lanka and Japan. Before starting his trip, Pompeo will address the India Ideas Summit of US-India Business Council on June 12. ""I'll be speaking to a group of Indian business leaders in preparation for the trip that I'll take in a couple weeks where I'll be visiting India, an important part of President Trump's strategy in the Indo-Pacific,"" he told reporters at the Foggy Bottom headquarters of the US State Department. ""I'm looking forward to the opportunity both to give the set of remarks about how it is our relationship is so closely tied economically, but also importantly the things that the United States and India can continue to do to build out what is an incredibly important relationship for both countries,"" Pompeo said. State Department spokesperson Ortagus said that Pompeo will travel to the Indo-Pacific region from June 24 to June 30 to ""broaden and deepen America's partnership with key countries to advance their shared goal of a free and open Indo-Pacific."" ""The secretary's first stop will be in New Delhi, India. Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi's recent election victory provides an excellent opportunity for him to implement his vision for a strong and prosperous India that plays a leading role on the global stage,"" she said. India, the US and several other world powers have been talking about the need to ensure a free, open and thriving Indo-Pacific in the backdrop of China's rising military maneuvering in the region. China has been trying to expand its military presence in the Indo-Pacific, which is a biogeographic region, comprising the Indian Ocean and the western and central Pacific Ocean, including the South China Sea. China claims almost all of the South China Sea. Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have counter claims over the sea. China has expanded through reclamation or built entirely new man-made islands atop coral reefs and has equipped many of them with military installations and airfields. Prime Minister Modi during his recent visit to the Maldives underscored India's firm commitment to make the strategic Indo-Pacific an area for shared economic growth, saying it has been ""our lifeline, and also the highway for trade and prosperity."" Pompeo will preview elements of a cooperative agenda during his remarks at the India Ideas Summit at the US Chamber of Commerce, State Department spokesperson Ortagus said. His next stop will be in Colombo, where Pompeo will express America's solidarity with the people of Sri Lanka as they stand united against the despicable Easter Sunday terrorist attacks. He will also discuss promising opportunities for US-Sri Lanka cooperation based on shared commitments to a free and open Indo-Pacific region, she said. Pompeo will then travel to Osaka, Japan, to participate in the G20 Leaders' Summit from June 28 -29, the first such gathering hosted by Japan. On the margins of the summit, Pompeo will join Trump in meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to coordinate ""on the final, fully verified denuclearization of North Korea"", and discuss ways to strengthen trilateral cooperation with South Korea on ""our unified approach towards North Korea"" and other shared challenges, she said. Following the G20 Summit, Pompeo will accompany Trump to South Korea to meet with President Moon Jae-in. ""The two leaders will also discuss ways to strengthen the United States-Republic of Korea alliance.

As Mallya left the stadium on Sunday night, he, his ex-Kingfisher air hostess girlfriend Pinky Lalwani and his mother, Lalitha, got surrounded by around 100 desi cricket fans chanting ""Chor hai"". The trio were completely boxed in by the fans, some of whom were angry and others who were enjoying filming the drama on their mobiles. As the crowd surged forward, Mallya told a reporter ""I am making sure my mother doesn't get hurt."" A man could be heard shouting: ""People love him!"" Another screamed: ""Be a man! Apologise to the country"" to which Mallya responded ""Thank you, all the best"". A man, who seemed to be helping Mallya through, said: ""No chor! Nobody can touch him” whilst another man shouted ""You're a thief."" #WATCH London, England: Vijay Mallya says, ""I am making sure my mother doesn't get hurt"", as crowd shouts ""Chor hai… https://t.co/eSyFta93fj &mdash; ANI (@ANI) 1560108336000 Mallya had arrived in the morning with Pinky in a chauffeur-driven pristine cream Bentley, the same car he has been spotted in at Silverstone, to be confronted by scores of Indian TV crews. He used to arrive at Westminster magistrates’ court, where he stood trial, in a more subdued black Land Rover. Asked how preparations for his court hearing are going, Mallya said: “Preparations will go on, but here today I have come to watch the match and support the Indian cricket team. See you later.” He then was inundated with further questions which he evaded. He entered the cricket gate, turned around and said: “I am here to watch the game.” The fugitive businessman’s next hearing at the high court, on July 2, will determine whether he can appeal his extradition order. Lalwani sneaked into the ground dressed in a fur gilet body-warmer, red shirt and shades, with her hair tied back, whilst her long-term partner spoke to the waiting Indian media. Mallya arrived perfectly dressed for a British society event in a pale blue blazer, an open-neck striped stiff-collar shirt under a blue waist jacket and a thick chain and hospitality pass around his neck to watch the two favourites in the heavyweight contest. A reporter said: “What are India's chances today?” He replied: “Well, you know who I am supporting. I am dressed all in blue,” as passersby gathered to shoot him on their mobiles. A reporter then asked: “I seem to remember you bought Australian cricketer Mitchell Starc on one occasion?” “Yeah, he played for the Royal Challengers. He is an absolutely world-class bowler,” Mallya replied. The July 2 hearing is critical as, if he loses it, he has almost run out of options and could be put on a plane and sent back to India any day after that but within 28 days. Unless he gets leave to appeal at the hearing, he cannot appeal the decision to extradite him in either the Supreme Court or the High Court. His only option, if he loses this next hearing, is to try and get a Rule 39 from the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). The 63-year-old posted a picture of himself and his son, Siddharth, on Twitter and wrote: ""Great to watch cricket with my son and even sweeter to see India’s emphatic victory over Australia.

China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of southern Tibet. India firmly maintains that the state is integral and inalienable part of the country. Ctrip.com International Limited, a Chinese provider of global travel services including travel and hotel accommodation, is currently regarded as the largest online travel agency in China. It removed the relevant products from its platform after 'We-media' exposed screenshots of Ctrip's webpage and phone application allegedly showing products ""calling South Tibet as Arunachal Pradesh"", state-run Global Times reported on Thursday. The daily quoted a statement issued by a Ctrip publicity department as saying that the company has ""removed the wrong information overnight"" after noticing reports. However, in the statement, Ctrip did not confirm or deny that the information refers to the depiction of the Sino-India border, the daily's report said. Ctrip said it is determined to safeguard China's national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and will launch a comprehensive investigation to avoid similar problems from happening again. Ctrip's action followed after screenshots posted by kunlunce.cn, the website of a Beijing-based think tank, showed that search results for the key words 'Arunachal Pradesh' in both Chinese and English display hotels in the region. However, in the geographical description, such sites were described 'in India', the report said. ""Ctrip has designated the South Tibet region as Indian territory by calling it 'Arunachal Pradesh'. Is it going to sell the country in such an open fashion,"" a netizen named baishuiwentianxia said on Sina Weibo on Wednesday.

Simpson says his life has entered a phase he calls the ""no negative zone."" In a telephone Interview, Simpson told The Associated Press he is healthy and happy living in Las Vegas. And neither he nor his children want to look back by talking about June 12, 1994 — when his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman, were killed and Simpson quickly was transformed in the public mind from revered Pro Football Hall of Fame hero to murder suspect. ""We don't need to go back and relive the worst day of our lives,"" Simpson said. ""The subject of the moment is the subject I will never revisit again. My family and I have moved on to what we call the 'no negative zone.' We focus on the positives."" For a man who once lived for the spotlight, Simpson has been keeping a largely low profile since his release from prison in October 2017 after serving nine years for a robbery-kidnapping conviction in Las Vegas. He continues to believe his conviction and sentence for trying to steal back his own memorabilia were unfair but says, ""I believe in the legal system and I honored it. I served my time."" After his release from the prison in Lovelock, Nevada, many expected him to return to Florida where he had lived for several years. But friends in Las Vegas persuaded him to stay there despite the case that landed him in prison. He's glad he did. ""The town has been good to me,"" Simpson said. ""Everybody I meet seems to be apologizing for what happened to me here."" His time in the city hasn't been without controversy, however. A month after his release an outing to a steakhouse and lounge at the Cosmopolitan resort off the Las Vegas Strip ended in a dispute. Simpson was ordered off the property and prohibited from returning. No such problems have occurred since, and Simpson is among the most sought-after figures in town for selfies with those who encounter him at restaurants or athletic events he attends occasionally. He plays golf almost every day and said he is a member of a club of ""retired guys"" who compete with each other on the golf course. The knees that helped him run to football glory at the University of Southern California and with the NFL's Buffalo Bills have been replaced and he recently had Lasik surgery on his eyes. But nearing his 72nd birthday, he is otherwise healthy. Simpson said he remains close to his children and other relatives. His parole officer has given him permission to take short trips including to Florida where his two younger children, Justin and Sydney, have built careers in real estate. His older daughter, Arnelle, lives with him much of the time but also commutes to Los Angeles. ""I've been to Florida two or three times to see the kids and my old buddies in Miami. I even managed to play a game of golf with them,"" he said. ""But I live in a town I've learned to love. Life is fine."" He also visited relatives in Louisiana, he said, and spoke to a group of black judges and prosecutors in New Orleans. Recently, a family wedding brought his extended family to Las Vegas including his brother, Truman; sister, Shirley; and their children and grandchildren. Simpson's first wife, Marguerite, mother of Arnelle, also joined the group. The glamor of his early life is just a memory. After his football career, Simpson became a commercial pitchman, actor and football commentator. He was once a multimillionaire but he says most of his fortune was spent defending himself after he was charged with the murders. His televised ""Trial of the Century"" lasted nearly a year and became a national obsession. He was acquitted by a jury in 1995 and has continued to declare his innocence. The murder case is officially listed as unsolved. The families of the victims subsequently filed a civil suit against him, and in 1997 a civil court awarded a $33.5 million judgment against him for the wrongful deaths of his ex-wife and Goldman. Some of his property was seized and auctioned but most of the judgment has not been paid. Simpson declined to discuss his finances other than to say he lives on pensions.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping would also attend the summit. The SCO is a China-led eight-member economic and security bloc. Its founding members include China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. India and Pakistan were admitted to the grouping in 2017. This week's SCO summit will be the first major international event being attended by Modi after his re-election. He would meet President Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the summit. Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan will also take part in the meeting. The summit would review the past year's work of the SCO and draw up a plan for cooperation this year, Chinese vice foreign minister Zhang Hanhui told a media briefing here. ""The institutional building of the SCO would be discussed involving economic and security cooperation, particularly on counter terrorism. Security and development are two major issues focus of the SCO,"" he said. ""The establishment of the SCO is not to target any country but summit of this level would certainly pay attention to major international and regional issues,"" he said in response to a question whether the thrust of the summit would be to oppose the US' trade frictions with China and other countries.

Kommersant, Vedomosti and RBK, among the most respected daily newspapers in the country, published a joint editorial under the headline ""I am/We are Ivan Golunov,"" calling for a transparent probe into the case of the prominent investigative journalist. Golunov, who works for the independent website Meduza, was beaten and kept in custody for 12 hours without a lawyer after he was stopped by police in Moscow on Thursday. He was transferred to house arrest on Saturday following a public outpouring of support, but he still faces drug dealing charges that could send him to prison for as much as 20 years. The papers dismissed evidence presented in the case against the journalist. Russia's media landscape is fragmented, and such a show of solidarity in the media is rarely seen. All three papers have faced pressure from authorities and covert censorship. Pavel Chikov, head of the lawyers' association Agora that represents Golunov, on Monday published results of tests that Golunov has taken to prove his innocence. He said the tests indicated that it is unlikely that he regularly handles drugs as police has suggested. Yevgeny Bryun of the Russian health ministry said on state television on Sunday that lab tests of Golunov's urine did not find any traces of drugs. The circumstances of the journalist's arrest have alarmed the media community. In an apparent attempt to portray Golunov as a professional drug dealer, police on Friday released several photos, reportedly from Golunov's home, of what appeared to be a drugs lab before they retracted the statement, saying that the pictures were taken elsewhere. Golunov rose to prominence with his investigations into corruption at the Moscow City Hall, the crime-ridden funeral industry and the murky food markets. The journalist told the court on Saturday that he has received threats related to his investigation into Moscow's funeral business. Meduza's director general Galina Timchenko said on the Ekho Moskvy radio station on Monday that Golunov told her in March about the threats after his piece came out. Timchenko said she had spoken with Golunov about security measures but she could not get Golunov to leave the country.

Nearly two decades after the US-led invasion, the extremist group is seen as an even greater threat than the Taliban because of its increasingly sophisticated military capabilities and its strategy of targeting civilians, both in Afghanistan and abroad. Concerns run so deep that many have come to see the Taliban, which has also clashed with IS, as a potential partner in containing it. A US intelligence official based in Afghanistan told the Associated Press that a recent wave of attacks in the capital, Kabul, is ""practice runs"" for even bigger attacks in Europe and the United States. ""This group is the most near-term threat to our homelands from Afghanistan,"" the official said on condition of anonymity to preserve his operational security. ""The IS core mandate is: You will conduct external attacks"" in the US and Europe. ""That is their goal. It's just a matter of time,"" he said. ""It is very scary."" Bruce Hoffman, director of the Center for Security Studies at Georgetown University, sees Afghanistan as a possible new base for IS now that it has been driven from Iraq and Syria. ""ISIS has invested a disproportionate amount of attention and resources in Afghanistan,"" he said, pointing to ""huge arms stockpiling"" in the east. A 'province' of the Caliphate The Islamic State affiliate appeared in Afghanistan shortly after the group's core fighters swept across Syria and Iraq in the summer of 2014, carving out a self-styled caliphate, or Islamic empire, in around a third of both countries. The Afghanistan affiliate refers to itself as the Khorasan Province, a name applied to parts of Afghanistan, Iran and central Asia in the Middle Ages. The IS affiliate initially numbered just a few dozen fighters, mainly Pakistani Taliban driven from their bases across the border and disgruntled Afghan Taliban attracted to IS' more extreme ideology. While the Taliban have confined their struggle to Afghanistan, the IS militants pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the reclusive leader of the group in the Middle East, and embraced his call for a worldwide jihad against non-Muslims. Within Afghanistan, IS launched large-scale attacks on minority Shiites, who it views as apostates deserving of death The group suffered some early stumbles as its leaders were picked off by US airstrikes. But it received a major boost when the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan joined its ranks in 2015. Today it counts thousands of fighters, many from central Asia but also from Arab countries, Chechnya, India and Bangladesh, as well as ethnic Uighurs from China. The group has long been based in the eastern Nangarhar province, a rugged region along the border with Pakistan, but has a strong presence in northern Afghanistan and of late has expanded into neighboring Kunar province, where it could prove even harder to dislodge. The mountainous province provided shelter for Osama bin Laden for nearly a year after the Taliban's ouster, and US forces struggled for years to capture and hold high-altitude outposts there, eventually all but surrendering the region to the Taliban. The area comprising the provinces of Nangarhar, Nuristan, Kunar and Laghman was so dangerous that the US-led coalition assigned an acronym to it in the years after the invasion, referring to it as N2KL. Militants launching shoulder-fired rockets from Kunar's peaks downed a US Chinook helicopter in 2005, killing 16 Navy SEALs and special operations forces in one of the deadliest single attacks of the war. Ajmal Omar, a member of the Nangarhar provincial council, says IS now has a presence in all four provinces. ""Right now in Kunar, the right side of the road is Taliban, the left side is Daesh and the government is in the middle,"" he said, referring to the group by its Arabic acronym. Speaking inside his heavily fortified home in the provincial capital, Jalalabad, he said neighboring Kunar would soon replace the Middle East as the IS group's center of gravity. ""When they began in Afghanistan they were maybe 150 Daesh, but today there are thousands and thousands,"" he said. ""The bad news is their acquisition of key terrain, height concealment, where they can have easy access to money, weapons, equipment . . .and from where they can plan, train, stage, facilitate and expedite attacks,"" said the US intelligence official. ""I think expansion of territory in eastern Afghanistan is their number one military objective,"" with the goal of eventually encircling Jalalabad, he said. Turning to the Taliban It's been nearly 18 years since the US invaded Afghanistan to topple the Taliban, which had harbored al-Qaida when bin Laden and his lieutenants were planning the Sept. 11 attacks. Now military and intelligence officials see the Taliban as a potential ally against a similar threat. In recent months the Taliban have said they have no ambitions to monopolize power in a post-war Afghanistan, while IS is committed to overthrowing the Kabul government on its path to establishing a global caliphate. The Taliban and IS are sharply divided over ideology and tactics, with the Taliban largely confining their attacks to government targets and Afghan and international security forces. The Taliban and IS have fought each other on a number of occasions, and the Taliban are still the larger and more imposing force. US envoy Zalmay Khalilzad has held several rounds of talks with the Taliban in recent months in a bid to end America's longest war. The two sides appear to be closing in on an agreement in which the US would withdraw its forces in return for a pledge from the Taliban to keep the country from being used as a launch pad for global attacks. ""One of the hopes of a negotiated settlement is that it will bring the Taliban into the government and into the fight against IS,"" the US intelligence official said. ""They know the mountains, they know the terrain. It's their territory."" But a negotiated settlement could also prompt an exodus of more radical Taliban fighters to join IS. That process is already underway in parts of northern and eastern Afghanistan, where the Taliban have attacked IS only to lose territory and fighters to the rival extremist group. Russia, which occupied Afghanistan in the 1980s before being driven out by US-backed Islamic insurgents, has been sounding the alarm about IS for years, and had reached out to the Taliban even before the US talks. During a visit to Kyrgyzstan last month, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu described Afghanistan as a ""launch pad"" for IS after the group was pushed out of Syria and Iraq. Russia, like the United States, sees a peace agreement between the Taliban and the Afghan government as the best way of countering the threat posed by IS, and Moscow has held two rounds of informal talks involving the Taliban, government representatives and other prominent Afghans. But as peace efforts have stumbled in recent months, Russia has turned to more lethal means of containing the threat. Shoigu said Russia has sent heavy equipment, including helicopters and armored vehicles, to Kyrgyz forces, and has boosted combat readiness in its bases in the former Soviet republics of Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. Threatening the West Without an aggressive counterterrorism strategy, Afghanistan's IS affiliate will be able to carry out a large-scale attack in the US or Europe within the next year, the US intelligence official said, adding that IS fighters captured in Afghanistan have been found to be in contact with fellow militants in other countries. Authorities have also already made at least eight arrests in the United States linked to the IS affiliate in Afghanistan. Martin Azizi-Yarand, the 18-year-old Texan who plotted a 2018 attack on a suburban mall, said he was inspired by IS and was preparing to join the affiliate in Afghanistan. He was sentenced in April to 20 years in jail. Rakhmat Akilov, the 39-year-old Uzbek who plowed his truck into pedestrians in Stockholm in 2017, also had links with the Afghanistan affiliate, the intelligence official said. ""During interrogation he said 'this is my commander in Afghanistan and he is telling me what to do,""' he said. Inside Afghanistan, the group is actively recruiting at universities, where it is more likely to find tech-savvy Afghans able to travel abroad, use social media and help plan sophisticated attacks, according to the intelligence official. The group's brutal tactics have been on vivid display inside Afghanistan for years. Suicide bombings have killed hundreds of Shiite civilians in Kabul and elsewhere, and residents who have fled areas captured by the group describe a reign of terror not unlike that seen in Syria and Iraq. Farmanullah Shirzad fled his village in Nangarhar in late April as IS fighters swept through the area. ""I was terrified to stay,"" he said. ""When Daesh takes over a village, they kill the people, they don't care about the children and they come into the homes and they take the women.""

Addressing the nation ahead of the federal budget for fiscal year 2019-20 to be announced Tuesday, Khan said. ""We will need to change ourselves if we want to become a great country."" ""I am appealing to all of you to take part in the Asset Declaration Scheme that we have brought, because if we don't pay taxes, we will not be able to raise our country up,"" Khan said. The premier said that people have until June 30 to declare their benami assets, benami bank accounts and money that was kept abroad. Benami is a term used for a transaction, contract, or property that is made or held under a name that is fictitious or is that of a third party who holds as ostensible owner for the principal or beneficial owner. ""After June 30, you will not get this opportunity,"" he said. ""Our agencies have information about who has benami accounts and benami properties,"" the premier said. ""This was never available to us before therefore take advantage of this scheme. Give Pakistan the benefit. Fix your children's future. (Give us) the chance that we get this country to stand on its own two feet and take people out of poverty,"" he said. ""My Pakistanis, in the past ten years Pakistan's debt went from Rs 6,000 billion to Rs 30,000 billion,"" he said. Khan said that the damage that this had caused to the country was that the annual tax collected was approximately Rs 4,000 billion, half of which went towards repaying loans ""they"" had taken. ""This country cannot cover its expenses on the money that is left behind,"" he added. Pakistan recently reached a preliminary agreement with the IMF for a $6 billion bailout. ""Pakistan is the country that unfortunately gives the least tax in the world but is among the few countries that give the most charity."" ""This is the country that has (the) capability and if passion comes in, we can at the very least gather Rs10,000 billion every year,"" the premier said. In May, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf government had announced its first tax amnesty scheme — Asset Declaration Scheme — for whitening of undisclosed expenditures, sales and assets, including foreign assets, at nominal tax rates. The scheme came into effect through a presidential ordinance, which will offer a period of 45 days to people for declaration of their undeclared assets, expenditures, and sales along with payment of taxes until June 30 this year. The scheme, approved by the federal Cabinet during a meeting presided over by the premier, has five main pillars — scope, default surcharge, exclusions, tax rates and conditions. Unlike the past schemes, no revenue realisation projection was made on the plea that it is meant for allowing the grey economy's inclusion in the tax net, Dawn newspaper said. The government plans to present an austerity-oriented budget with no increase in the salaries of army officials of higher ranks. This is the second time that the premier has appealed to the people to declare their benami assets and bank accounts under the government's Assets Declaration Scheme by June 30.

The arrest came hours after a two-member bench of the Islamabad high court rejected the pre-arrest bail pleas of Zardari and his sister, Faryal Talpur, in a case related to fake bank accounts and transactions — worth hundreds of millions of Pakistani rupees — with private companies allegedly owned by the two leaders. A number of PPP workers and the children of the former president, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and Asefa Bhutto Zardari, saw him off as he was driven away by officials of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) to their lock-up in Islamabad’s Melody area where he was to undergo a medical check-up. The NAB will present the medical check-up report, as well as Zardari, in court on Tuesday to seek his custody. Both Zardari and Talpur can appeal the high court order in the Supreme Court of Pakistan. The NAB had issued a warrant for Zardari on Sunday. No warrant has been issued for Talpur as yet. “The NAB chairman overrode judicial orders and issued a non-bailable warrant for Asif Ali Zardari. We already had bail so how can the NAB warrant override the court’s orders,” said Latif Khosa, Zardari’s counsel. Zardari and his sister are accused of hiding financial kickbacks in fictitious accounts. Investigators say fake bank accounts were used to channel billions of rupees. Dozens of companies and hundreds of people have been implicated in the scam. In 2015, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) had launched a probe into fake accounts and fictitious transactions conducted through 29 “benami” accounts in different banks. Initially, seven individuals, including Zardari and Talpur, were said to be involved in using those accounts for suspicious transactions. Later, the Supreme Court court took suo motu cognisance due to a delay in the FIA probe and also constituted a joint investigation team (JIT) to probe the scam. The JIT uncovered 33 more suspicious accounts and around 170 individuals linked to the case. According to a report submitted in court, 210 companies were also found to have alleged links to the case. Forty-seven of these companies and 334 people were associated with Omni Group, owned by a close aide of Zardari. At one stage, the top court had frozen all assets and accounts of the group. The FIA had filed the case before a banking court in Karachi which had issued an arrest warrant for Zardari. Subsequently, the PPP leader had obtained bail from the Islamabad HC and, later, the case was shifted from a court in Karachi to Islamabad as the investigators had accused the PPP of influencing the case. On April 8, two accused in the case — Kiran Aman and Noreen Sultan — became approvers against Zardari and Talpur. Zardari denies wrongdoing in the fake accounts case. He already had spent 11 years in jail on corruption and murder charges before becoming president in 2008. He was never convicted.

"69720262"|"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-defends-immigration-deal-with-mexico/articleshow/69720262.cms"|"[AP]"|"STERLING, Va.: With his threatened Mexican tariffs now on the backburner, President Donald Trump was looking to claim victory even as some of his Democratic challengers for the White House criticized him for overselling a deal that mostly ramps up existing efforts. Trump defended the agreement reached by US and Mexican negotiators to head off the 5% tax on all Mexican goods that Trump had threatened to impose Monday as he tried to pressure the country to do more to stem the flow of Central American migrants across the US southern border. But he also dangled the prospect Sunday of renewing his threat if the US ally doesn't cooperate to his liking. ""There is now going to be great cooperation between Mexico & the USA, something that didn't exist for decades,"" Trump tweeted before spending a second day at his Virginia golf course. ""However,"" he added, ""if for some unknown reason"" that doesn't happen, ""we can always go back to our previous, very profitable, position of Tariffs."" Business leaders and many Republicans had urged Trump against the tariffs, warning they would drive up consumer prices, hinder the economy and compromise the ratification of an updated North American trade deal. The tweets came amid questions about just how much of the deal — announced with great fanfare Friday — was really new. It included a commitment from Mexico, for instance, to deploy its new National Guard to the country's southern border with Guatemala. Mexico, however, had already intended to do that before Trump's latest threat and had made that clear to US officials. Mexican officials have described their commitment as an accelerated deployment. The US also hailed Mexico's agreement to embrace the expansion of a program implemented earlier this year under which some asylum-seekers are returned to Mexico as they wait out their cases. But US officials had already been working to expand the program, which has already led to the return of about 10,000 to Mexico, without Mexico's public embrace. ""The president has completely overblown what he reports to have achieved. These are agreements that Mexico had already made, in some cases months ago,"" said Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke, speaking on ABC's ""This Week."" ""They might have accelerated the time table, but by and large the president achieved nothing except to jeopardize the most important trading relationship that the United States of America has."" Another 2020 candidate, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, chastised Trump for using tariffs as a threat and operating a ""trade policy based on tweets."" ""I think what the world is tired of and what I am tired of is a president who consistently goes to war, verbal war with our allies, whether it is Mexico, whether it is Canada,"" he said. But acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, speaking on ""Fox News Sunday"" insisted ""all of it is new,"" including the agreement to dispatch around 6,000 National Guard troops — a move Mexico has described as an ""acceleration."" ""This is the first time we've heard anything like this kind of number of law enforcement being deployed in Mexico to address migration, not just at the southern border but also on the transportation routes to the northern border and in coordinated patrols in key areas along our southwest border,"" he said, adding that ""people can disagree with the tactics"" but that ""Mexico came to the table with real proposals"" that will be effective, if implemented. Trump echoed the same in his tweets, insisting the deal was being misrepresented and demanding more credit from the press. ""We have been trying to get some of these Border Actions for a long time, as have other administrations, but were not able to get them, or get them in full, until our signed agreement with Mexico,"" he wrote, claiming that if former President Barack Obama had made the deals he has, ""the Corrupt Media would be hailing them as Incredible, & a National Holiday would be immediately declared."" He also teased the idea that more was agreed to than was announced Friday, saying that ""some things"" and ""one in particular"" that had been left out of the release but would be ""announced at the appropriate time."" He could have been referring to discussion about Mexico becoming a ""safe third country,"" which would make it harder for asylum-seekers who pass through the country to claim refuge in the US The idea, which Mexico has long opposed, was discussed during negotiations. But Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard has said Mexico did not agree to it. Mexico's ambassador in Washington nonetheless said her country is committed to working with the US and that discussions will continue. ""We want to continue to work with the US very closely on the different challenges that we have together. And one urgent one at this moment is immigration,"" said Martha Barcena. She told CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that the countries' ""joint declaration of principles ... gives us the base for the road map that we have to follow in the incoming months on immigration and cooperation on asylum issues and development in Central America."" The US, she said, wants to see the number of migrants crossing the border return to levels seen in 2018.

Xi will pay state visits to Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan from June 12 to 16, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lu Kang announced here on Sunday. The SCO summit is due to be held on June 13-14 in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. The SCO is a China-led eight-member economic and security bloc with India and Pakistan being admitted to the grouping in 2017. From June 12 to 14, President Xi will pay a state visit to Kyrgyzstan and attend SCO summit, Lu said in a statement. Indian Ambassador to China Vikram Misri said last week that the two leaders would meet on the sidelines of the SCO summit. Recalling last year's successful first ever informal summit between Xi and Modi at Wuhan which was widely regarded a milestone in the bilateral ties, Misri said, ""it is worth mentioning that last year, our leaders met four times on the sidelines of different multi-lateral meetings."" They are again meeting in Bishkek on the sidelines of the SCO Summit, he said. The April 27-28 Wuhan summit between Modi and Xi was largely credited to have turned around the bilateral relations soured by the 73-day Doklam standoff, triggered by Chinese troops attempts to build a road close to Indian border in an area also claimed by Bhutan in 2017. After the Wuhan summit, both the countries stepped up efforts to improve relations on different spheres including the military-to-military ties. In December last year, Prime Minister Modi met President Xi on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Argentina and discussed joint efforts to further enhance mutual trust and friendship between the two giant neighbours. Last month, Xi extended his ""heartfelt congratulations"" to Prime Minister Modi for winning the general elections, in a rare gesture of greeting a foreign leader well before the official announcement of the results. After the SCO summit, President Xi will travel to Tajikistan. From June 14 to 16, the president will attend the fifth summit of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA) in Dushanbe, the capital city of Tajikistan, Lu added.

The amendment allows the chief executive of the autonomous city state to extradite local people charged with different offences to mainland China, without legislative oversight. The Hong Kong police put the number of protesters at 2,40,000, while organisers of the demonstration, mostly local activists, said that close to 10 lakh people took part. The protesters converged at the Central, the central business district of the city, where most government offices and commercial establishments are located. The government bill is due to be put to vote on June 12 and protesters are trying to block the process. Earlier, lawyers took out protest marches over the bill, while business associations voiced their concerns. Protesters said they feared justice would be denied to those taken across the sea to mainland China, instead of being tried in Hong Kong. Hong Kong, which has a democratically elected government, enjoys special autonomy status with its own set of laws which are different from mainland China. The city administration, however, says the bill is an important tool to fight international crime and maintain the rule of law. Police has given demonstrators a midnight deadline to disperse from the Central. There are no reports of violence from the scene, only a few scuffles with police. Police have arrested seven people though. Several activist groups including Civil Human Rights Front played important roles to organize the massive show of strength against the bill. ""In any place where there are 1.03 million people marching ... any government should listen to people's demands,"" Jimmy Sham Tsz-kit, convener of the front said. Two pro-independence groups that organized the demonstration, the Student Localism and Students Independence Union, said they will continue to demonstrate outside the Legislative Council premises until the voting day.

The HIV positive cases were identified among the 21,375 tested in Larkana in May, and out of the affected, 604 are between the ages of 2 to 15. Health officials have attributed the cause to the use of unsanitary equipment, unsafe blood transfusion and rampant malpractice often at the hands of quacks. A report by the WHO experts, who are in Pakistan to investigate the outbreak of HIV cases and also support the local authorities' response to the medical emergency, says that more than half of the patients in Sindh remain deprived of any sort of treatment facilities. The WHO team has said that 751 people have tested positive for the HIV virus of which 604 are children. The report states that only 324 patients (47 per cent) have been provided treatment until now, while 427 (53 per cent) still await medical assistance. As per the report, the provision of the required medicines is a daunting challenge as Pakistan only has stocks to treat 240 of the 604 affected children. It further states that medicine stocks being used to treat the 240 children in different hospitals would last only until July 15. The HIV outbreak was first reported on April 25th and a major HIV screening program was then initiated on April 28. Muzaffar Ghangro, a doctor from the district, who was arrested on the suspicion of having spread the HIV virus with infected needles at his clinic has been cleared of “intentionally” spreading the deadly virus in Ratodero town of the Larkana district.

Bangladesh hosts over a million Rohingyas in makeshift refugee camps in its southeastern Cox's Bazar district as the fled a Myanmar military crackdown in August 2017 generating the worst refugee crisis in the recent history. In January 2018, a deal was signed between Bangladesh and Myanmar to repatriate Rohingya refugees. Myanmar had agreed to accept 1,500 Rohingyas each week, Bangladesh said at the time, adding that it aimed to return all of them to Myanmar within two years. ""The problem lies with Myanmar as they don't want Rohingya to return by any means though it signed an agreement with Bangladesh promising to repatriate them,"" she told a press conference at her Ganabhaban official residence. The premier feared that some international aid and voluntary agencies are also unwilling to resolve the crisis. ""They never want the refugees to return to their home,"" she said. ""This is what I see,"" she said at a media briefing on her tri-nation tour of Japan, Saudi Arabia and Finland at Ganabhaban. Asked about a perception that three major countries - China, Japan and India - took Myanmar's side in the crisis, the premier said Bangladesh separately held talks with these countries and they all acknowledged Rohingyas as Myanmar nationals and agreed they should return there. ""(But) they (the three countries) simultaneously argued that if they all confront Myanmar over the issue, then who will be there to convince them (Naypyidaw),"" she said. Prime Minister Hasina also said that she will travel to China in July at the invitation of Chinese President Xi Jinping. It will be her first visit to China after forming government for a third consecutive term. The premier said she might also visit India if invited. Replying to another question whether the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) nations were in favour of Rohingyas' repatriation as she referred to the crisis in the just held summit of the 57-nation Muslim countries forum, the premier said ""certainly"". Hasina expressed her concerns about the security factors involving the Rohingyas as many of them were found to be getting engaged in criminal activities, forcing the authorities to ask armed forces and law enforcement agencies to intensify their vigil. ""We asked them to raise a security cluster around them (Rohingya camps) and enforce a constant patrol,"" she said.

Airman 1st Class (A1C) Harpreetinder Singh Bajwa an Airman near Lakewood, Washington State, was authorised to adhere to Sikh religious grooming and dress principles while serving his country. Indian-American Congressman Ami Bera applauded the decision of the US Air Force to the authorise the first active Airman to wear a turban, beard, and long beard in adherence to his religious beliefs.

I urge the Department of Defence to expand these religious accommodations and make them more easily accessible,"" Bera said. Previously, Sikhs were not permitted to adhere to certain Sikh beliefs due to grooming and dress guidelines. In 2017, the Army became the first military branch to allow Sikh Americans to receive career-long accommodations to wear articles of faith. Bera, in concert with the Sikh Coalition, advocated for a constituent from California's 7th District, Private Shabaddeep Singh Jammu, to obtain long-term religious accommodation. As a first-generation American born to an immigrant family, A1C Bajwa enlisted in the Air Force in 2017, eager to give back by serving his country.

However, after learning about religious accommodations granted recently to Sikh service members in the US Army, as well as a religious accommodation allowing a Muslim Air Force JAG Corps officer, Cpt. Maysaa Ouza, to wear hijab, A1C Bajwa contacted Sikh American Veterans Alliance (SAVA) to determine whether he, too, would be eligible for an accommodation. The SAVA, through its pro bono counsel BakerHostetler, then connected Bajwa with the ACLU, which had successfully represented Cpt. Ouza and had won a groundbreaking lawsuit against the Army, requiring religious accommodation of a Sikh ROTC cadet. In response to a letter sent by the ACLU on Bajwa's behalf, the Air Force approved his accommodation request. ""As one of the first Sikh service members to receive a religious accommodation from the Army, I'm proud to see A1C Bajwa become the first active Airman allowed to wear his Sikh articles of faith while in uniform. Sikhs have a long history of serving in militaries around the world, and I'm confident that A1C Bajwa will represent that tradition honourably,"" said Lieutenant Colonel Kamal Kalsi Singh, president of SAVA.

""Marriage steals childhood,"" said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore in a statement issued on Friday. ""Child grooms are forced to take on adult responsibilities for which they may not be ready. Early marriage brings early fatherhood, and with it added pressure to provide for a family, cutting short education and job opportunities."" According to the data, the Central African Republic has the highest prevalence of child marriage among males (28 per cent), followed by Nicaragua (19 per cent) and Madagascar (13 per cent). The new estimates bring the total number of child brides and child grooms to 765 million. Girls remain disproportionately affected, UNICEF observed, with 1 in 5 young women aged 20 to 24 years old married before their 18th birthday, compared to 1 in 30 young men. While the prevalence, causes, and impact of child marriage among girls have been extensively studied, little research exists on child marriage among boys. However, children most at risk of child marriage come from the poorest households, live in rural areas, and have little to no education, UNICEF noted. ""As we mark the 30th anniversary of the adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, we need to remember that marrying boys and girls off while they are still children runs counter to the rights enshrined in the Convention,"" said Fore. ""Through further research, investment and empowerment, we can end this violation.""

The other countries who were elected to the UNSC included Estonia, Niger, Tunisia, and Vietnam. The UN, in a statement, said that the five states will take up their seats as non-permanent members of the Security Council in January 2020, replacing Cote d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Kuwait, Peru and Poland. Every year, five countries are elected to the 15-member Council (10 of whom are non-permanent) for a two-year term, according to a geographical rotation set by the Assembly in 1963, to ensure fair regional representation-- five from African, Asian and Pacific States, one from Eastern Europe, two from Latin American States, and two from Western European and other states (WEOG). While Niger, Tunisia and Vietnam were elected unopposed, two of the five seats were contested. El Salvador competed with Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to represent the Latin American and Caribbean group, Romania lost out to Estonia in the East European group. Speaking to reporters outside the General Assembly Hall, Ralph Gonsalves, Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, described the election of his multi-island nation of around 110,000 people, as a ""historic occasion"". Gonsalves said that his country is committed to the principle of sustainable development. In addition, being a group of small islands in the Caribbean Sea and facing a high risk of inundation, the country is very concerned about the consequences of adverse climate change and intends to work very closely with the other members of the Security Council. Following a 2014 General Assembly resolution, elections to the non-permanent Security Council seats were moved from October to June, to give incoming countries more time to prepare for their terms, before assuming their responsibilities.

But the deal the two neighbours agreed to falls short of some of the dramatic overhauls the US had pushed for. I am pleased to inform you that The United States of America has reached a signed agreement with Mexico. The Tariff… https://t.co/EVGSKXleS6 &mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 1559953867000 A ""US-Mexico Joint Declaration"" released by the State Department said the US ""will immediately expand the implementation"" of a program that returns asylum-seekers who cross the southern border to Mexico while their claims are adjudicated. Mexico will ""offer jobs, healthcare and education"" to those people, the agreement stated. Mexico has also agreed, it said, to take ""unprecedented steps to increase enforcement to curb irregular migration,"" including the deployment of the Mexican National Guard throughout the country, especially on its southern border with Guatemala. And Mexico is taking ""decisive action to dismantle human smuggling and trafficking organisations as well as their illicit financial and transportation networks,"" the State Department said. The move puts to an end — for now — a threat that had sparked dire warnings from members of Trump's own party, who warned the tariffs would damage the economy, drive up prices for consumers and imperil an updated North American trade pact. Trump's Friday night tweet marked a sharp reversal from earlier in the day, when his spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters: ""Our position has not changed. The tariffs are going forward as of Monday."" Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador tweeted, ""Thanks to the support of all Mexicans, the imposition of tariffs on Mexican products exported to the USA has been avoided."" He called for a gathering to celebrate in Tijuana Saturday. The changes, in part, continue steps the Trump administration was already taking. The US announced in December that it would make some asylum seekers wait in Mexico while their cases were being proceeded — a begrudging agreement with Mexico that has taken months to scale and that has been plagued with glitches, including wrong court dates, travel problems and issues with lawyers reaching their clients. Homeland Security officials have been ramping up slowly, and were already working to spread the program along the border before the latest blowup. About 10,000 people have been returned to Mexico to wait out the processing of their immigration cases since the program began January 29. More than 100,000 migrants are currently crossing the US border each month, but not everyone claims asylum and migrants can wait an entire year before making a claim. Any sizable increase may also be difficult to achieve. At the San Ysidro crossing alone, Mexico had been prepared to accept up to 120 asylum seekers per week, but for the first six weeks only 40 people per week were returned. Trump had announced the tariff plan last week, declaring in a tweet that, on June 10, the US would ""impose a 5 per cent Tariff on all goods coming into our Country from Mexico, until such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico, and into our Country, STOP."" US officials had laid out steps Mexico could take to prevent the tariffs, but many had doubts that even those steps would be enough to satisfy Trump on illegal immigration, a signature issue of his presidency and one that he sees as crucial to his 2020 re-election campaign. After returning from Europe Friday, though, Trump tweeted, ""I am pleased to inform you that The United States of America has reached a signed agreement with Mexico."" He wrote that the ""Tariffs scheduled to be implemented by the US on Monday, against Mexico, are hereby indefinitely suspended."" He said Mexico has agreed to work to ""stem the tide of Migration through Mexico, and to our Southern Border"" and said those steps would ""greatly reduce, or eliminate, Illegal Immigration coming from Mexico and into the United States."" The 5 per cent tax on all Mexican goods , which would increase every month up to 25 per cent under Trump's plan, would have had enormous economic implications for both countries. Americans bought $378 billion worth of Mexican imports last year, led by cars and auto parts. Many members of Trump's Republican Party and business allies had urged him to reconsider — or at least postpone actually implementing the tariffs as talks continue — citing the potential harm to American consumers and manufactures. From the moment Trump announced the tariff threat, observers wondered whether he would pull the trigger, noting his habit of creating problems and then claiming credit when he rushes in to solve them. In late March, Trump threatened to shut the entire US-Mexico border if Mexico didn't immediately halt illegal immigration. Just a few days later, he backed off that threat, saying he was pleased with steps Mexico had taken. It was unclear, however, what — if anything — Mexico had changed. US and Mexican officials met for more than 10 hours Friday during a third day of talks at the US State Department trying to hash out a deal that would satisfy Trump's demand that Mexico dramatically increase its efforts to crack down on migrants. The talks had been focused, in part, on attempting to reach a compromise on changes that would make it harder for migrants who pass through Mexico from other countries to claim asylum in the US, those monitoring the situation said.

The US is attempting to “impose its jurisdiction across the entire world,” Putin said. This is pushing the world on a “path to permanent conflicts, trade wars, and maybe not only trade ones,” he said. Putin and Xi barely mentioned Trump and the US directly, but the target of their remarks was clear. Their comments created the strange spectacle of the leaders of the world’s biggest Communist nation and its authoritarian neighbour staunchly defending a global system of rules they have often been accused of seeking to undermine. The Chinese leader’s visit to Russia comes as he seeks to face down Trump amid escalating tensions between the world’s two biggest economies. Asked about Trump’s tactics of using tariffs to force China into a deal, Xi urged “mutual respect” in resolving disagreements between powers. “One shouldn’t resort to one-sided approaches, protectionism,” he said. Xi presided over the signing of $20 billion in agreements at his meeting with Putin in Moscow at the start of his three-day visit to Russia. Among them was an accord for Huawei Technologies Co, which faces a US ban from 5G networks, to start pilot zones in Russia with Mobile TeleSystems PJSC. Putin on Friday lauded Russia-China cooperation as a major factor in maintaining global stability. He named Trump’s campaign against Huawei as an example of US efforts to monopolise the world economy, along with threats of sanctions to derail the construction of the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline to Europe. The use of the dollar as an instrument of pressure was undermining its role as a global reserve currency, he said. The world risks “sleepwalking into a new Cold War” amid the international tensions, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said at the same panel with Putin and Xi. “This has to stop.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."|"Xi, Putin condemn US dominance as tensions with Trump grow"|"Sat Jun 08 06:16:00 CEST 2019"|"[world]"

About 1,400 soldiers in ceremonial scarlet coats and bearskin hats marched past the queen in a ceremony on Horse Guards Parade in Westminster. Royals taking part included Prince Charles, Prince William and his wife Kate, and Prince Harry and his wife Meghan - who appeared in her first public outing since giving birth to their son, Archie, to watch the birthday fly-past of military aircraft. Baby Archie did not appear, but another young royal almost stole the queen's limelight when he made his debut on Buckingham Palace's balcony. One-year-old Prince Louis, the youngest child of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, waved frantically at the first of the helicopters in the show. The queen marks her birthday twice a year - an official ceremony is always held in June, in hopes of holding the parade in good weather. Her actual birthday, on April 21, is usually celebrated with close family only. Thousands of spectators lined the parade ground and gathered in nearby St. James's park to watch the spectacle in sparkling sunshine. They then walked down the road leading to Buckingham Palace, gathering at the gates to honor the monarch ahead of the fly-past, the punctuation mark of the annual event. It's been a big week for the monarch. Demonstrating the close link between the monarchy and the armed forces, she was the center of ceremonies marking the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings, the invasion of France that marked the beginning of the end of the Nazis. But if the 93-year-old sovereign was tired, it didn't show. She waved and smiled as she emerged on the balcony and the crowd roared. The ceremony originated from traditional preparations for battle. The colors - or flags - were ""trooped,"" or carried down the lines of soldiers, so they could be seen and recognized in battle. The regimental flag being paraded this year is from the 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards.

The incident took place during the wee hours of May 30, when the women, who are in their 20s, boarded the bus in West Hampstead. ""There were at least four of them. They started behaving like hooligans, demanding that we kissed so they could enjoy watching, calling us 'lesbians' and describing sexual positions,"" one of the victims, Melania PS claimed in a Facebook post. The six of them were the only ones in the bus, apart from the driver, Melania added. ""In an attempt to calm things down, I started making jokes. I thought this might make them go away. Chris (her partner) even pretended she was sick, but they kept on harassing us, throwing us coins and becoming more enthusiastic about it,"" she further said, recounting the horrific incident. ""The next thing I know is that Chris is in the middle of the bus fighting with them. On an impulse, I went over there only to find her face bleeding and three of them beating her up. The next thing I know is I'm being punched. I got dizzy at the sight of my blood and fell back. I don't remember whether or not I lost consciousness. Suddenly the bus had stopped, the police were there and I was bleeding all over. Our stuff was stolen as well,"" she stated. Both women were taken to the hospital for treatment of facial injuries. They have now been discharged, the police added. ""This was a disgusting attack on two women who appear to have been picked out and targeted by a group of youths. The suspects have made a number of homophobic comments towards the couple before throwing coins at them. When the women tried to reason with the group, the attack escalated to an assault,"" Detective Superintendent Andy Cox said in a statement. The homophobic incident has been widely condemned by the top brass of political leaders in the UK, including London Mayor Sadiq Khan and Prime Minister Theresa May. ""This was a disgusting, misogynistic attack. Hate crimes against the LGBT+ community will not be tolerated in London. The @metpoliceuk are investigating and arrests have been made. If you have any information - call 101,"" Khan tweeted. ""This was a sickening attack and my thoughts are with the couple affected. Nobody should ever have to hide who they are or who they love and we must work together to eradicate unacceptable violence towards the LGBT community,"" CNN quoted May as saying.

I would like to reassure those heading out over the weekend that extra uniformed and plain clothes Safer Transport officers will be out on patrol working to keep them safe and prevent crime,"" Cox lastly said, urging witnesses to come forward. The attack comes at a time when the LGBTQIA+ community is observing Pride month to commemorate the Stonewall riots which took place in June 1969. While the UK decriminalised homosexuality over 50 years ago, hate crimes against the community are still reported.

The Pentagon went so far as to ask 42 Turkish pilots — who have been training in Arizona and Florida for the past several months preparing to receive the first of 100 F-35s Turkey has contracted to buy – to leave the United States by July 31. The Pentagon also said it would end Turkish participation in management and manufacturing activities related to the F-35 program. Turkish companies are said to currently produce almost 1,000 parts for the F-35, including landing gear and fuselage components. ""While we seek to maintain our valued relationship, Turkey will not receive the F-35 if Turkey takes delivery of the S-400,"" Acting US defence secretary Patrick Shanahan wrote in a blunt letter to his Turkish counterpart Hulusi Akar. ""You still have the option to change course on the S-400."" The US is arguing that putting the S-400 system in proximity to the F-35, America’s most advanced fighter, would allow Russia to learn too much about the aircraft’s radar profile and potential vulnerabilities. Washington has made similar arguments to India, implicitly warning that buying the Russian S-400 will cast a shadow on the burgeoning US-India ties that has seen big Indian purchase of American arms. US cautions Modi government against buying Russian S-400 missile defence system A squeeze on Turkey could devolve into a test case of New Delhi's heft and spine, how substantial and important a partner India is to the United States, and whether the American pursuit of a new Indo-Pacific policy to counter China will allow Washington and New Delhi some wiggle room on the S-400 issue. The tough-talking Trump administration is indicating that it will not hesitate to throw Turkey, a Nato ally, under the bus if its commercial and strategic interests are affected. The Russian purchase ""will hinder your nation’s ability to enhance or maintain cooperation with the United States and within NATO, lead to Turkish strategic and economic over-dependence on Russia, and undermine Turkey’s very capable defence industry and ambitious economic development goals,"" Shanahan warned in his letter leaked to the US media. Although India is not a NATO ally, is less militarily dependent on Washington, and does not manufacture any arms systems or subsystems for the US, it has nevertheless developed close military ties with the US Washington has been trying hard of hawk a souped-up F-16, dressed up as an India-specific F-21 with some F-35 features. New Delhi is not biting. Like India, Turkey has also argued that it has already gone too far with its commitment to buy the Russian system and it is a done deal. It has also said the US counter offer to sell its Patriot missile defence system – something American officials have also implied could be available for India if it ditches the S-400 – is too late and too expensive. The Trump administration has sent it assistant secretary of state for politico-military affairs R Clarke Cooper to New Delhi this week to make the case for the F-16/F-20 and against the S-400 in the backdrop of the larger security relationship. Ahead of the visit, a fact sheet issued by the politico-military bureau said India is the first non-treaty partner to be offered a MTCR Category-1 Unmanned Aerial System (Drone) – the Sea Guardian UAS manufactured by General Atomics. It said the administration also ""continues to support advocacy for the Lockheed Martin F-21 and Boeing F/A-18 – two state of the art fighter aircraft that India is currently evaluating,"" suggesting the US is still hoping to wean India away from further European and Russian purchases. ""These platforms provide critical opportunities to enhance India’s military capabilities and protect shared security interests in the Indo-Pacific region,"" it added.

Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, a young reformist who assumed office a year ago, has been at the center of high-profile diplomatic efforts in the Horn of Africa region, including a surprise restoration of diplomatic ties between Ethiopia and rival Eritrea. He arrived in Sudan as the crisis following the overthrow of longtime autocrat Omar al-Bashir turned increasingly violent. The military removed al-Bashir from power in April after months of mass protests, but has resisted the protesters' demands for an immediate handover of power to civilians. On Monday, security forces violently dispersed the main sit-in outside the military headquarters in Khartoum, and similar clashes have erupted in other cities and towns. The African Union, based in Ethiopia, suspended Sudan on Thursday and threatened ""punitive sanctions'' if the military doesn't quickly relinquish power. Abiy met Friday with Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, the head of the ruling council, as well as protest leaders. In a phone interview with Saudi-owned satellite channel al-Arabiya, protest leader Gaafar Hassan declined to discuss the meeting in detail, saying a news conference would be held later, but ruled out any ""direct'' or ""indirect'' talks with the military. ""The (military) council has lost its political as well as its ethical legitimacy and we cannot deal with it, but we call for its ouster,'' he said. There was no immediate comment from the military council or the Ethiopian prime minister. The Sudan Doctors' Central Committee, one of the protest groups, said at least 113 people have been killed and more than 500 wounded since Monday. It says more than 40 bodies have been pulled from the Nile River in Khartoum and taken away by security forces since the violence erupted. The protesters have blamed much of the violence on the Rapid Support Forces, a paramilitary group that grew out of the notorious Janjaweed militias mobilized by al-Bashir during the Darfur conflict in the early 2000s. The militias were widely accused of crimes against humanity, and al-Bashir now jailed in Khartoum was indicted on charges of genocide. The head of the RSF, Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo _ better known as Hemedti _ was ""conspicuously absent'' in photos shared by the Ethiopian prime minister's office, according to Rashid Abdi, a former project director with the International Crisis Group. ""That is significant,'' he wrote on Twitter. ``Lends credence to reports of push to sideline the RSF commander.'' In a statement released late Thursday, protest leaders demanded that the RSF be dissolved and its weapons handed over to the army. Amnesty International said the RSF should return to their barracks and be barred from any law enforcement activities. ""The senseless killing of protesters must be stopped immediately, and those responsible for the bloodbath, including at command level, must be held fully accountable for their dreadful actions,'' said Kumi Naidoo, secretary general of the London-based rights group. After al-Bashir's ouster, the Ethiopian prime minister had congratulated the Sudanese people for their ``resilience in leading change'' toward a democratic Sudan. He had met with Burhan during the general's visit to Addis Ababa last week, when he committed to ``non-interference'' in the situation but urged political inclusiveness. Abiy is seen as having good relations with the West, which has cheered his reforms, as well as with powerful Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia, that have influence over Sudan's military. Awol Allo, a lecturer in law at Keele University in Britain and an Africa analyst, said Abiy stands a ``much better chance'' than anyone else in bringing the two sides together. Abiy ``brings a lot to the table, from his own experience of leading a complex transition to a massive amount of positive energy, and the weight of Ethiopia's power within the region,'' the analyst said. Meanwhile, the UN health agency said Friday it is gravely concerned over the targeting of patients, medical staff and facilities during the crackdown. Security forces are making ``incursions into Khartoum hospitals,'' the World Health Organization said, forcing shutdowns of emergency and health services. It said five patients and medical workers have been wounded. The agency said tent clinics set up to treat wounded protesters have been set ablaze and destroyed, medical equipment has been looted, and health care workers assaulted.

In an interview with three reporters accompanying him to the Gulf, Gen. Frank McKenzie said he remains concerned by Iran's potential for aggression, and he would not rule out requesting additional US forces to bolster defenses against Iranian missiles or other weapons. ""I don't actually believe the threat has diminished,"" McKenzie said. ""I believe the threat is very real."" McKenzie, the head of US Central Command, and other military officials are trying to strike a balance between persuading Iran that the US is prepared to retaliate for an Iranian attack on Americans, thus deterring conflict, and pushing so much military muscle into the Gulf that Iran thinks the US plans an attack, in which case it might feel compelled to strike preemptively and thus spark war. Tensions between the US and Iran have worsened since President Donald Trump withdrew from a 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and several world powers, and reinstated sanctions on Tehran. Last month, in response to what American officials characterized as an imminent threat, the US announced it would rush an aircraft carrier and other assets to the region. The US also blamed Iran for last month's attacks on oil tankers in a United Arab Emirates port. On Thursday, United Nations ambassadors from the Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Norway told UN Security Council members that investigators believe those attacks were led by a foreign state using divers on speed boats who planted mines on the vessels. They did not name Iran. Earlier, the Saudi ambassador to the UN, Abdallah Al-Mouallimi, said Saudi Arabia also blames Iran for the sabotage. In Baghdad, McKenzie told reporters from The Associated Press and two other media organizations that US redeployments to the Gulf have ""caused the Iranians to back up a little bit, but I'm not sure they are strategically backing down."" The general said the US is showing enough force to ""establish deterrence"" without ""needlessly"" provoking its longtime adversary. ""We're working very hard to walk that line."" He said he is confident in the moves he has made thus far. ""We've taken steps to show the Iranians that we mean business in our ability to defend ourselves,"" he said, referring to the accelerated deployment to the Gulf area of the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group, four Air Force B-52 bombers and additional batteries of Army Patriot air-defense systems. Trump, speaking beside French President Emmanuel Macron in Caen, France, said US sanctions are crippling Iran's economy, possibly yielding a diplomatic opening. ""And if they want to talk, that's fine,"" the US president said. ""We'll talk. But the one thing that they can't have is they can't have nuclear weapons."" Speaking at the Baghdad headquarters of the US-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria, McKenzie said he also has repositioned surveillance aircraft to more closely monitor the situation in the Gulf and in Iraq, where the US has 5,200 troops on the ground, and has given Iran a ""new look"" by introducing more aerial patrols by land- and carrier-based fighters. ""Cumulatively, all of these have caused them to sort of step back and recalculate the course that they apparently were on,"" he said. McKenzie did not mention it, but other officials have said that in early May Iran had cruise and perhaps short-range ballistic missiles configured for potential use aboard a small number of dhows sailing off its coast. More recently, those missiles, which were deemed a potential threat, were offloaded, officials have said. McKenzie stressed that the danger of conflict with a decades-old American adversary has not passed. ""I hesitate to say that deterrence has been established,"" he said. ""We continue to see possible imminent threats"" of a potential Iranian attack. He said he could not be more specific due to the classification of the intelligence, which he said is as clear and compelling as any he has seen in years. McKenzie, a veteran of combat in Iraq and Afghanistan, took command of Central Command in late March, shortly before the onset of the latest surge in tensions with Iran. He previously directed the staff that supports the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The general said he — not the White House — initiated the May 5 moves to accelerate the deployment of the Abraham Lincoln carrier group and to dispatch B-52 bombers. He said the intelligence on Iranian threats in the first days of May was ""compelling"" and that the threats were ""advanced, imminent and very specific."" The pattern of intelligence on Iranian preparations for potential attacks emerged as the Trump administration took a pair of highly public actions meant to penalize Iran. The first was the State Department's designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization. The second, perhaps more consequential, move was a April 22 announcement that waivers for American sanctions on buyers of Iranian oil would not be renewed when they expired May 2, meaning Iran lost vital oil export revenues.

Writing in the Financial Times (FT) on Friday, Theresa May’s last day as Conservative leader, Javid, among the Tory leadership hopefuls, said: “The former universities minister Jo Johnson has won support across the House of Commons for a programme of post-study visas for foreign students, allowing them to stay and work in the UK for two years after they graduate from a British university. It makes no sense to send some of the world’s brightest and most enterprising people straight home after their time here. So as prime minister I would make Mr Johnson’s plan government policy.” It was in 2012, when May was in charge of the home office (2010-2016), that the two-year post-study work visa was abolished. Indian student numbers subsequently fell from 39,090 in 2010-11 to 16,550 in 2016-17. In 2017-18, the number rose to 19,750. Currently, Indian students have to leave the UK after six months or transfer to another visa. MP Jo Johnson, an ex-FT South Asia bureau chief, has tabled a cross-party amendment to the Immigration and Social Security Coordination (EU Withdrawal) Bill, which has the backing of 78 cross-party MPs, to re-introduce the scheme and remove students from annual net migration targets. His amendment states that European Economic Area (EEA) and Swiss nationals should be allowed “to remain to search for work or gain work experience in the UK for a period of at least two years after the completion of their higher education course” and they must not be “included in any numerical limit on the number of entry visas issued”. The bill is currently at report stage in the House of Commons. Johnson, the brother of Boris Johnson MP, explained: “The scope of the bill is just about EEA and Swiss nationals as this bill is about ending EU freedom of movement in the UK so we were only able to get this amendment accepted, but that does not matter because government policy is for EEA and non-EU nationals to be treated the same post-Brexit. So once we have created the two-year post-study work visa, the government will need to level up for non-EEA nationals as it will all be one system and that is why this will affect Indian students.” “It’s been a constant goal of mine to reverse the decline in the number of Indian students coming to study in the UK ever since I was universities minister. I hope this will help make the UK a top choice for Indian students in the years to come,” Johnson said. “It can happen as soon as the bill is enacted or the home office can choose to make it policy now,” Johnson added. “The government has a choice. It either accepts this clause or it accepts defeat in the House of Commons as it will lose the vote if this clause is not added,” he said.

Figures published by TfL, the local government body which runs London’s transport system, show that India has the fourth-highest debt of all embassies and owes TfL £6,196,465 (about Rs 55 crore). An India high commission official said they were aware of the figure but were not paying it. “This is a kind of tax and diplomatic missions are exempted from paying any taxes,” he said. The charge was introduced in 2003 to reduce congestion and pollution in the centre of the capital and invest the profits into public transport. A similar idea has been floated but never implemented in Delhi and Mumbai to ease their traffic problems. The figures show that as of March 31, 2019, the total amount owed by embassies in London for unpaid congestion charge and related penalty charge notices is £118.5 million (Rs 1,047 crore). The American embassy has the highest debt at £12.5 million (Rs 110 crore), followed by the embassy of Japan at £8.6 million (Rs 76 crore) and the Nigeria high commission, which owes £7.1 million (Rs 63 crore). A US embassy spokesperson said: “Our position on the tax established by TfL, more commonly known as the congestion charge, is based on the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which expressly prohibits the taxation of diplomatic missions in this manner. Our position is therefore wholly in accordance with that convention, to which both the US and the UK are parties, and it is a position shared by many other diplomatic missions in London.” “We are clear that the congestion charge is a charge for a service and not a tax,” said Paul Cowperthwaite, TfL’s general manager for road user charging. “This means that foreign diplomats are not exempt from paying it. We continue to pursue all unpaid congestion charge fees and penalty charge notices.” TfL is now lobbying the British government to take the debt to the UN’s International Court of Justice (ICJ.) “We’re pushing for this to be taken up by the ICJ,"" a spokesman said. Drivers have 48 hours to pay the £11.50 (Rs 1,016) fee once they have entered the zone otherwise they are slapped with a £160 (Rs 14,140) penalty charge. If they do not pay, the debt is passed onto enforcement agents who send bailiffs round. Cameras with number plate recognition record vehicles entering the zone. “With embassies, our hands are tied. If they do not pay, their license plate will incur a charge against it, but all we can do is keep sending them letters as the embassies are on diplomatic land. We can’t send bailiffs round. That’s why they have not paid as that is not particularly scary. Around three quarters of embassies in London do pay, but there remain a stubborn minority who refuse to,” the spokesman said. A UK foreign office spokesperson said they “pressed all diplomatic missions to pay congestion charge debt” and raised the issue with new ambassadors and high commissioners whose missions are in debt to TfL. But one London-based diplomat said: “Diplomacy is generally reciprocity.

Ivan Golunov, who works for the independent website Meduza, was stopped by police in central Moscow on Thursday afternoon. Police also said that more drugs were found at his home. Meduza said in a statement on Friday that Golunov, one of the most prominent investigative journalists in Russia, was beaten while in detention and denied medical tests that would show he has not handled drugs. Moscow police denied the accusations of beating. The journalist's lawyer told the RIA Novosti news agency that his client was not allowed to contact his family or lawyer for 12 hours after he was detained. Golunov, 36, has recently received threats linked to a story he was pursing, Meduza said. ""We are convinced that Ivan Golunov is innocent,'' Meduza said in a statement. ""What's more, we have reasons to believe that Golunov is being persecuted for his journalism. We know that Vanya (Golunov) has been receiving threats in recent months, and we know which particular unfinished story they relate to.'' Meduza was founded in 2014 by a group of journalists who left a popular Russian news website after their editor was fired. The website is based in Riga, Latvia, as the journalists fear that an increasing wave of media censorship and restrictive internet laws in Russia make any editorial office there vulnerable to government pressure. While most of Meduza's staff is based in Riga, special correspondents like Golunov are working in Russia. Moscow police attached nine photos to its statement about Golunov's detention, some of which showed what appeared to be a makeshift drugs lab at his home. Alexander Urzhanov, a friend, said he had been to Golunov's place and that the pictures of the drugs lab were not taken at his apartment. Golunov rose to prominence in recent years with his corruption investigations into Moscow's city government and the crime-ridden funeral market. Peers described Golunov as one of Russia's most dogged investigative reporters. ""This is totally incredible and is not in his character that he would give up what he's been doing and start making money in this way,'' Alexander Baunov of the Moscow Carnegie Center told The Associated Press. Baunov has known Golunov since 2004 when they were worked together.

The Trump White House appears to have taken this dig at the media to heart with a large scale purge of the White House press corps, a process that some in the media suspect is aimed at sidelining critics of the President. Citing concerns from the US Secret Service about the proliferation of those holding White House “hard passes” (which provide easier access to the White House grounds and briefing room without cumbersome security checks), President Trump’s press boffins recently revoked credentials of all White House accredited journalists after instituting new rules that allowed back only those who met certain attendance criteria. The new standard now permits a hard pass (which are valid for two years and was held by nearly 1000 scribes) only to those journalists who have been in attendance at the White House for at least 90 of the previous 180 days. This effectively purges all but regular beat reporters (and in some cases even regulars) considering that, excluding weekends, they would have to be in the White House for seven out of ten days. In the past, many journalists, including columnists who did not regularly go to the White House, held hard passes. The White House has offered to consider a more restricted six-month hard pass to those who regularly cover or write commentary on the Presidency. The difficulty in achieving the new metric is compounded by the fact that the Trump White House has virtually scrapped the practice of daily briefing that previous administration’s conducted and President Trump himself spends a lot of time away from the White House. The daily briefing has also been supplanted by unscheduled “gaggles” on the White House driveway near the “beach” where network and cable television crews have temporary tents. Some scribes now turn up at the White House grounds to simply mark their “attendance” so as to retain their hard pass. By one count, the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, has had only two briefings in 2019, including a record stretch of 59 days without a briefing as of Thursday. President Trump himself has rubbished the daily briefing practice and even advised Sanders to ditch the exercise, preferring to use Twitter for his messaging, a method that obviates questions from hard-nosed reporters. But many scribes say the White House policy is neither fair nor consistent, and appears mainly at limiting access to critics and those who ask hard questions. “For the past 21 years, I have had the high privilege of holding a White House press pass, a magical ticket that gives the bearer a front-row seat to history….After covering four presidents, I received an email informing me that Trump’s press office had revoked my White House credential.” Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank wrote on Thursday, saying he suspects his hard pass has been revoked because he is a Trump critic. The White House has said however that it would grant exceptions for “senior journalists” who are “consistently engaged in covering the White House” and for those with “special circumstances,” a caveat that allows selective and subjective choices. For instance, one Indian-American “scribe” who does not write or report or even blog – ever since his free grocery store tabloid was laid to rest eight years ago – has managed to retain his hard pass through several administration because he offers a useful distraction to White House spokespersons who are facing tough or hostile questioning from reporters about burning issues. Dubbed “Goyal Foil” by the press corps, the journalist, Raghubir Goyal of the non-existent India Globe, typically asks questions relating to India and Indian-Americans amid heated exchanges on other hot button topics to provide an escape route for spokespersons.

Suhail Shaheen, the Taliban's political spokesman in Doha, tweeted that ""some progress"" had been made at the sixth round of peace talks and that the foes would meet again for another round of discussions. ""In general, this round was positive and constructive. Both sides listened to each other with care and patience,"" Shaheen wrote on Twitter. The US embassy in Kabul did not immediately comment, nor did US peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, the Afghan-born former US ambassador to Afghanistan who is leading negotiations for the Americans. Shaheen told AFP on Sunday that peace negotiations were stumbling over the fundamental question of when foreign forces would depart Afghanistan. Before the US agrees to any withdrawal as part of an eventual deal, it is demanding the Taliban put in place security guarantees, a ceasefire and other commitments including an ""intra-Afghan"" dialogue with the Kabul government and other Afghan representatives. The Taliban, however, insist they won't do any of these things until the US announces a withdrawal timeline. At the end of a large peace summit in Kabul last week, President Ashraf Ghani offered the Taliban a ceasefire to begin on the first day of Ramadan, but the insurgents refused.

The schools were shutdown and public mass services were suspended following fears of a repeat of the April 21 attacks on three churches and three luxury hotels here. Archbishop of Colombo Cardinal Malclom, Ranjith in a press conference said that that Catholic private schools might be opened on May 14. However, he said these schools would be closed till Vesak holidays, if there are fresh threats, the Daily Mirror reported. ""We cannot allow even a single child to suffer. Therefore, we intend to watch the situation closely and carefully,"" cardinal Ranjith said following a meeting between the country's 12 bishops and President Maithripala Sirisena in Colombo on Thursday. Vesak, the day of the full moon in the month of May, is the most sacred day to millions of Buddhists around the world and this year it was expected to be observed from May 17 to 21. However, the Sri Lankan government has restricted the five-day national Vesak festival celebrations to just two days citing the prevailing security situation in the country following the massive Easter Sunday bombings. Ranjith also said regular Sunday services would resume at all Catholic churches in Colombo from Sunday while a special service will be held at Negombo, north of the capital, where over 100 people were killed in the attack. Nine suicide bombers, including a woman, carried out a series of devastating blasts that tore through three churches and three luxury hotels, killing 258 people and injuring over 500 others. Following the attack, the authorities closed all the schools until further notice. All government schools were reopened on Monday, but attendance has been low despite new security measures. The government has blamed a local group, the National Thawheed Jammath (NTJ), for the bombings. Islamic State claimed responsibility and the bombers filmed themselves making a pledge of allegiance to the group before the attacks.

We still hope that the US will meet us halfway.” For now, though, the markets tanked, the Dow Jones index plunging by 600 points at the time of writing this amid fears of a worldwide ripple effect in the days to come. China’s response came after a series of Monday morning tweets by Trump in which he alternately tried to shame and cajole Beijing into a deal, which he suggested was almost reached before it backed out. “I say openly to President Xi & all of my many friends in China that China will be hurt very badly if you don’t make a deal because companies will be forced to leave China for other countries. Too expensive to buy in China. You had a great deal, almost completed, & you backed out!” Trump wrote, giving his version of the breakdown in both talks and trust. “Many Tariffed companies will be leaving China for Vietnam and other such countries in Asia. That’s why China wants to make a deal so badly! There will be nobody left in China to do business with. Very bad for China, very good for the USA! But China has taken so the advantage of the US for so many years, that they are way ahead (Our Presidents did not do the job). Therefore, China should not retaliate-will only get worse!” he warned. ..There will be nobody left in China to do business with. Very bad for China, very good for USA! But China has take… https://t.co/f0XWQQQFfz &mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 1557762923000 But the US President seemed to discount the fact that few countries in the world, even relatively weaker ones such as Iran and Venezuela much less a strong China, would roll over in the face of public castigation. Beijing's response and statements suggested precisely that – and many Trump critics in the US also maintained that finesse would have worked better. However, Trump is clearly emboldened by the strength of the US economy and is actually arguing that the tariff war has helped it and could eventually benefit Americans even more, though many economists, including his own aides, are saying it is the American businesses and consumers who will eventually pay for the tariffs, not China, which will also suffer on account of decreased exports to the US “Their (sic) is no reason for the US Consumer to pay the Tariffs, which take effect on China today. This has been proven recently when only 4 points were paid by the US, 21 points by China because China subsidizes product to such a large degree,” Trump maintained in a series of tweets littered with typos, arguing, “Also, the Tariffs can be completely avoided if you by (sic) from a non-Tariffed Country, or you buy the product inside the USA (the best idea). That’s Zero Tariffs."" There is no reason for the U.S. Consumer to pay the Tariffs, which take effect on China today. This has been proven… https://t.co/Cxc5AwxKOG &mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 1557762922000 “The unexpectedly good first quarter 3.2% GDP was greatly helped by Tariffs from China. Some people just don’t get it!” he added. Departing significantly from the rosy picture Trump is painting, his economic advisor Larry Kudlow acknowledged that companies and consumers in both countries will feel the pain, but suggested Washington held the trump card. “Politically, I think the country is completely behind the president and his tough approach on China and, in fact, as you know, leading Democrats such as Sen. Schumer and others have supported the president in this battle,” he pointed out. But some experts are warning that Trump’s base constituency itself will soon feel the pain as China tariffs US goods and cuts down on imports of US farms produce and products such as Boeing aeroplanes. Beyond that, American consumers will also begin shelling out more for everything from smartphones to sneakers, from TV sets to toasters that China exports in huge numbers to the US in a trade layout that has devastated American manufacturing but has given Americans cheap and affordable goods and products. By one estimate, an American family of four will pay up to $800 annually on goods and products on account of the tariff war.

The much-anticipated Daxing International Airport, located 46 kms from the city, is designed to take pressure off the overcrowded Beijing Capital International Airport (BCIA), one of the busiest in the world. The new airport located at the junction of Daxing district and Langfang, a city in North China's Hebei Province, will have seven runways and is expected to handle 45 million passengers annually by 2021 and 72 million by 2025, state-run CGTN reported. China Southern Airlines, China Eastern Airlines, Air China and Xiamen Airlines sent their flagship Boeing and Airbus planes for the test. So far over 50 airlines have expressed their interest in operating from the airport. The new airport carried out test flights, verified various systems in the airport, including flight procedures, minimum performance criteria, communication facilities navigation, meteorology, runways and the airfield lighting system. This is the first time that commercial passenger aircraft have landed at the airport, signalling that the basic construction is complete. After this verification, the airport will go on with its efforts to get ready for commercial operation, the report said. The airport is of the highest standard in China and has the longest runways to provide the best condition for planes to land. The budget for building the airport amounted to $11.5 billion, the report said. The test followed the airport's first flight of verification planes on January 22 this year. The construction process is set to end by June 30 and the airport is scheduled to take low-visibility flight test in August and go into operation by September 30. The new airport is 67 kms away from the BCIA, one of the busiest in the world. Ninety-six million passengers passed through the BCIA in 2017.

Several attempts were made by successive governments since the country was ruled by military dictator Pervez Musharraf to bring these Islamic schools under the ambit of the government, but all such efforts were in vain. The mushrooming of madrassas and their radicalisation in Pakistan started in the 1980s. It was the brainchild of former military dictator General Zia-ul-Haq. With the financial backing of Saudi Arabia and the US, Haq and his spy network, Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), established training and arming centres for thousands of mujahideen fighting Soviet forces in Afghanistan. After the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan and its formal disintegration, the seminaries that were formed to run jihadist training camps were tolerated by the Pakistani state for strategic reasons — to use jihad as an instrument of influence in Afghanistan and Kashmir. The idea to reform seminaries and reverse the policy of his predecessor was first conceived by Musharraf after the US invasion of Afghanistan in the wake of a series of massive terrorist attacks by Al Qaeda on US soil on September 11, 2001. While Musharraf had banned scores of militant outfits operating from Pakistan, he had failed to take any drastic step to restructure the madrassas. In January 2015, after a terrorist attack on an army-run school in Peshawar that left more than 140 people dead, mostly students, the military and all political parties had finalised a 20-point action plan, known as the National Action Plan (NAP), a policy aimed at elimination of terrorism and extremism. Some proposals related to the military, like military offensives, the establishment of military courts and capital punishment for those convicted in cases of terrorism, were implemented. But madrassa reform, one of the most important parts of the NAP, remained ignored. Movement on the NAP proposal related to action against extremist elements was witnessed earlier this year when Pakistan, confronted with a deepened economic crisis and pressure from global powers, had banned the Jamaat-ud-Dawah (JuD) and its welfare wing, Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation (FIF), the two organisations headed by Hafiz Saeed, the alleged mastermind of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks. Since the designation of JuD and FIF as proscribed groups, the government had clamped down on its facilities and sealed its seminaries, besides taking administrative control of its pharmacies, health units, schools and ambulances across the country. “The government has arrested dozens of our workers to please India and the US. Thousands of our workers have become jobless since we can’t pay them salaries. The government has choked all means of our earnings, we are barred from raising funds to continue our welfare activities,” a senior JuD leader told TOI on condition of anonymity. The acceptance of responsibility for the February 2019 suicide attack on Indian troops in Pulwama, Kashmir, by the Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM), a Pakistan-based outfit, had further intensified pressure on Pakistan. Observers believe the announcement by Islamabad that it will introduce “madrassa reforms” and disassociate itself from banned organisations could be the way forward to convincing the international community that the country was serious about tackling terrorism and religious extremism. “It seems Pakistan is now serious about cutting back its connections with hardliners and their outfits due to compulsions. It may not be in accordance with the wishes of Islamabad but it has no other option. Even friends of Pakistan, like China and the Gulf countries, aren’t supporting Islamabad’s design of harbouring militants,” said Nazr ul Islam, a Pakistani journalist working on militancy in the region. According to official figures, Pakistan currently has 30,000 registered madrassas attended by approximately 2.5 million students. There are also believed to be thousands more that are unregistered, including single-room schools with a handful of students studying the Quran. All members of militant groups were groomed, trained and indoctrinated in some of these schools which are responsible for promoting violent extremism and maintaining ties to transnational terrorist networks. This year, Pakistan has taken some action indicating that the country is gradually distancing itself from the ideology of extremists and hatemongers. Just last week Islamabad had banned at least 11 groups for having links to the JuD and JeM. Previously, Islamabad would only reluctantly go against some small outfits or individuals when pressured but now it is acting against the “untouchables” — JeM, JuD, FIF and groups linked to them. This transformation can be seen in other areas as well. Pakistan had witnessed extreme violence last year after the Supreme Court had ordered the release of Aasia Bibi, a Christian woman who had spent nearly a decade on death row for a false blasphemy accusation. There was not a single protest anywhere in Pakistan when she left the country for Canada last week.

She won, but now no doctors are willing to perform the procedure she fought so hard to defend. The last abortion provider in the heavily Catholic US territory retired in May 2018. That's forcing women seeking to end their pregnancies to fly thousands of miles from the remote Pacific island — a costly and sometimes prohibitive step. ""I truly believe that women should have control of their bodies,"" Gov. Guerrero, a former nurse, told The Associated Press in a phone interview Thursday. ""I'm very sad and very nervous about what's happening across the nation."" Several conservative states like Alabama and Missouri have passed tough abortion restrictions as they take aim at the 1973 Roe v Wade ruling that legalized abortion across the United States. Guam's law , which Guerrero described as ""very restrictive,"" allows abortion, but doctors also have the legal right to deny services unless it's a medical emergency. Abortions are allowed within 13 weeks, but anyone who terminates a pregnancy without help from a doctor can be charged with a felony. Guerrero said she believes that doctors in Guam would still perform abortions if a woman's life were in danger, but she's concerned that other women will be forced to seek illegal or dangerous alternatives. ""That's my fear,"" she said. ""I'm concerned about it going underground because then we can't really control it, we can't really monitor, we can't really make sure that the women are doing it in an environment that is conducive to a healthy recovery."" The governor said officials are trying to recruit doctors to come to the island and establish clinics. She said anti-abortion protesters are active on the island but are peaceful and doesn't believe doctors fear for their safety. ""Doctors here, I think, are reluctant because of the Catholic community, I think they're reluctant because they don't want to be in the controversy,"" Guerrero said. Guerrero asked voters during the campaign last year if they support abortion, and many do despite about 80% of Guam's 165,000 residents being Catholic, she said. Her opponent disagreed. ""Life begins at conception, period ... We must protect every life,"" former Lt Gov. Ray Tenorio said during a debate, the Pacific Daily News reported . The other US territories in the Pacific — American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands — both prohibit abortions except in very limited circumstances. All territories are partially self-governing but still under federal rule. While Hawaii, a nearly eight-hour flight from Guam, is the closest US state for a legal abortion, there have only been a handful of Guam women treated since last year, and none for an elective procedure, said Dr. Bliss Kaneshiro, an obstetrician-gynecologist and University of Hawaii professor. ""It's a big problem. Abortion care is pretty basically reproductive health care — we know that many women will need an abortion during the course of their reproductive years,"" Kaneshiro said. ""We know that making abortion inaccessible doesn't eliminate it, it forces women to seek unsafe measures to end a pregnancy."" She said, to her knowledge, all those who have come from Guam are ""women with desired pregnancies where there are severe anomalies that have prompted their decision to terminate their pregnancies."" ""It's really quite a small number,"" she said. ""I would say over the course of the past six months, we have seen two or three patients."" But Kaneshiro and her colleagues have heard about ""many patients"" on Guam needing abortion services. ""Some of the doctors on Guam will contact us about patients,"" she said. But ""it requires a lot of financial resources for (the women) to come to Hawaii to get that care, and so not all of them end up actually coming here."" Even in Hawaii, the island of Kauai has no abortion providers, forcing most women to fly to Oahu or Maui, and the Big Island only recently began offering services, Kaneshiro said. Hawaii was the first state to approve a program in which doctors can mail abortion medications to patients so they don't have to travel, she said. But Guam law prevents doctors from mailing the medicine because the territory requires patients to have an in-person counseling session with a doctor or psychologist. In a recent court case, a Guam man was charged with raping and impregnating an 11-year-old girl, who will have to go through with her pregnancy, Jayne Flores, director of the Bureau of Women's Affairs, told the Pacific Daily News . A message left with Guam's archdiocese wasn't immediately returned. A call to the clinic where abortions were previously performed wasn't answered.

On Friday, May will formally step down as Prime Minister having set the timetable for her Downing Street exit last month. It will then trigger the official phase of the Conservative Party leadership contest from Monday, so far with 11 MPs in the running to succeed her. Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson remains the frontrunner, but the field is seen as wide open at the moment. During her speech on the steps of Downing Street, May said: ""It is, and will always remain, a matter of deep regret to me that I have not been able to deliver Brexit"".

The military-backed party that nominated Prayuth won the second-highest number of seats in the House of Representatives in a general election in March. But his selection was virtually assured on Wednesday because the prime minister is chosen in a joint vote of the 500-seat House and the 250-seat Senate, whose members were appointed by the junta Prayuth leads. Two House seats were vacant due to a suspension and resignation. Prayuth was elected to serve a second term by a vote of 500 to 244 for his opponent, Future Forward party leader Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit. Prayuth, a former army commander, was the candidate of the military-backed Palang Pracharath party, which holds 116 House seats, as well as lawmakers from smaller parties. Prayuth's appointment becomes official when it is endorsed by King Maha Vajiralongkorn. ""The people are still calling for liberties. The people are still calling for justice,"" Thanathorn said after the vote. ""This is not the time to lose hope. Hope is still on our side. Time is still on our side. I want to thank all 244 people who love democracy for voting for me."" Prayuth made no immediate public comment on the vote. Prayuth did not run for office in the March election — the constitution enacted under the junta he headed does not require that the prime minister come from Parliament. Laws passed under his government handicapped established political parties, raising concerns the election was not held on a level playing field. Critics also questioned the fairness of the Election Commission, alleging that rules were bent after the election to benefit Palang Pracharath. The new election laws were aimed especially at the Pheu Thai party, which headed the government ousted by the 2014 coup and won the most House seats in March. Pheu Thai is associated with former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was removed by a 2006 coup and lives in exile to avoid serving a prison term on a conflict of interest conviction he decries as politically motivated. The populist policies of Thaksin won him enormous support at the polls but also threatened the influence of traditional power holders, including the military. His following remained strong even after his ouster, and his sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, became prime minister in 2011, only to have her Pheu Thai government also toppled by the army in 2014. Wednesday's vote indicates that Prayuth's coalition also has control — by a small margin — of the House, necessary to pass laws and approve budgets. But there are doubts that a government led by Prayuth, used to governing by fiat, can fare well in a parliamentary framework. ""General Prayuth's return to the premiership has gone according to the ... junta's design. But managing a coalition government and a Parliament with a sizable opposition is very different from overseeing a military dictatorship,"" said Michael Montesano, coordinator of the Thailand Studies Program at Singapore's ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute. ""If observers are right and the new coalition proves too unstable to last more than a few months, the fear that another coup will pitch Thailand into an even bleaker situation is on the mind of many."" An open-ended parliamentary debate, with the two sides touting the merits of their candidate and the weaknesses of their opponent, pushed Wednesday's vote late into the night. The official result was announced just before midnight. During the debate, Palang Pracharath lawmaker Koranis Ngamsukonrattana praised Prayuth for his character and his vision. ""He's patient and sacrificed himself so much for the country,"" he said. ""He's the savior who came in and saved the country when all hope was lost."" Thanathorn's supporters attacked Prayuth as a destroyer of democracy. ""Coups are the ultimate crime against the rule of democracy with the monarch as head of state,"" said Piyabutr Saengkanokkul, secretary general of Thanathorn's Future Forward party. ""It rips apart the entire constitution and takes power to rule over the country by establishing yourself as a 'sovereign' with the highest power."" It was a novelty for Thais to see such parliamentary battling after five years of army rule in which there was only a tame rubber stamp assembly. While the formation of a government will finally return Thailand officially to civilian rule, it will be done under a new political system enacted by the junta Prayuth has led and its appointees. It is a system that critics say is meant to prolong rule by the military and its allies in the conservative establishment, rather than reflect the will of everyday Thais. The Palang Pracharath coalition was opposed by the ""Democratic Front,"" comprising seven anti-military parties led by Pheu Thai. They nominated the charismatic young Thanathorn as their candidate for prime minister. Future Forward, whose platform included strong opposition to military interference in politics, finished a strong third in the March election. Its unexpected performance has drawn it a raft of legal challenges from the military's supporters, and Thanathorn himself has been suspended from Parliament until the Constitutional Court decides whether be violated election law by allegedly holding shares in a media company. Neither candidate was present for Wednesday's debate. Prayuth attended to official government business, while Thanathorn was absent from the assembly hall due to a court-ordered suspension that his supporters charge is politically motivated.

Every summer, people come from miles around to search for the precious crop, which sells for over USD 100 a gram across Asia and the US. The local authorities have set up health camps at various places for facilitating the Yarsagumba collectors. Over a dozen pluckers are receiving treatment in these health camps, officials said. Yarsagumba is a unique caterpillar-fungus fusion that occurs when parasitic mushroom spores infect and mummify a ghost moth larva living in the soil. There are more than 70 highland meadows opened for Yarsagumba pickers in Dolpa district, situated 600 km north-west of Kathmandu.

The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the military's media wing, was quoted as saying that contents of the story ""Uncovering Pakistan's Secret Human Rights Abuses,"" published on June 2, carries conjecturing implicating Pakistan Army without any proof, the Xinhua news agency reported. The BBC report claimed that scores of innocent people were killed in aerial strikes and ground operations of the Pakistani military during its operations against the militants in the northwest tribal district of North Waziristan. Questioning the credibility of the story, the military said that they received a judgmental questionnaire from the BBC via email, to which they responded by offering a full opportunity and even interaction to know the facts. However, the media group never responded and did a preconceived, conjectured story. The statement said that the BBC story is void of the context and understanding of the prevalent environment at that time. ""Contrary to the expression in the story, operation in North Waziristan as per the given date of the so-called incident in the report had not yet started. The area was being used by terrorists to plan, coordinate and execute terrorist activities across the country, the ISPR said. ""On the average, 6-8 terrorist incidents per month were taking place across Pakistan, targeting children, women, schools, churches and markets. People were being slaughtered in North Waziristan and terrorists were playing football with heads of their victims. North Waziristan district and the local population were actually hostages to hardcore terrorists,"" it said. The BBC story lacks any credible and authentic source and merely relied on hearsay, the ISPR said, noting that the only sources interviewed in the story also did not mention any airstrike or operation that left a lot of people killed. ""The story remains ill intended, biased and part of a larger agenda. It also amounts to undermining Pakistan's efforts for fighting the global menace of terrorism and Pakistan's unparalleled achievements in the war against terrorism, contributing to regional peace,"" the ISPR added.

So what does this surprising move say about Pakistan, its PM, its army and its economy where just 1% of the population files an income tax return and 76% of the government’s pension bill — $1.72 billion — is used for the pensions of its ex-servicemen? Voluntary? Not really, since the IMF made its $6 billion loan conditional on Khan's government cutting its budget deficit by $5 billion. Given that Islamabad has been toying around with several belt tightening measures which is expected to include an unofficial currency devaluation, the defence budget cut is expected to allow the government to spend on developing the tribal regions and Balochistan. Currently, over 50% of the government's expenditure is used for meeting military and debt-servicing costs. A real cut? Pakistan's military spending has been steadily rising over the years, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of GDP. In fact, compared to India, whose defence spending last year was 2.4% of its GDP, Pakistan's was 4% — though in absolute terms, India's defence budget is four times its neighbouring country's defence budget. That raises the question of whether Pakistan's military budget will remain the same or will it actually see a reduction in absolute terms — given that for the last two years, its defence spending has remained largely constant. Catch-22? Pakistan, in fact, was the 20th largest spender on defence globally in 2018, with its military spending as a share of its GDP the highest in the last 15 years, according to SIPRI. Islamabad has also, in recent years, especially after Donald Trump became US President, seen military aid from its one-time strongest backer cut — last year, over $3 billion in military aid by US to Pakistan was cut for giving a safe haven to terrorists. Given how much its military assistance from the US has been cut, it remains to be seen how much of a voluntary cut will Pakistan's defence forces be willing to make in their budget.

Pakistan's military, in a rare move, decided to voluntarily cut the defence budget for the next fiscal year amid an austerity drive launched by the government to solve the cash-strapped nation's financial woes. Commenting for the first time on the unprecedented move by the powerful military, Chief of Army Staff Gen. Bajwa on Wednesday assured the nation that there would be no impact to the military's ""response potential"" due to the voluntary cut in the defence budget. Bajwa who spent Eid-ul-Fitr with troops along the Line of Control (LoC) said the best Eid for a soldier is to have pride for being on duty of defending the motherland even on such festive days away from the family. ""For defenders of Pakistan, our first family is the Pakistani nation, then the ones back home,"" he said while giving a pep talk to the troops. Speaking on the voluntary decision to forego even the routine increase in the annual defence budget, the army chief said, ""This initiative is not a favour to the nation as we are one through thick and thin."" ""Irrespective of the voluntary cut in defence budget coming financial year (FY), there shall be no impact on our response potential to all types of threat and quality of life of the soldiers. ""The no pay raise decision is also only for the officers and not for the soldiers,"" Bajwa said in a statement. He said the Pakistan Army will manage the shortfall during the financial year by ""tightening our belt"". Pakistan in 2018 was the 20th biggest military spender in the world with an expenditure of $11.4 billion, a report published by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute said in April. Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has welcomed the military's voluntary cuts, especially in light of the country's financial situation. His cash-strapped government has negotiated a $6 billion bailout package from the International Monetary Fund to overcome the financial woes facing the country. Khan said he was grateful for the move that came ""despite multiple security challenges"" that Pakistan faces. He added that the funds saved will be used for the development of the newly-merged tribal areas as well as in Balochistan. Meanwhile, the Director General Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) Major General Asif Ghafoor tweeted on Wednesday that voluntary cuts in the defence budget for a year would not be at the cost of defence and security. ""We shall maintain effective response potential to all threats. Three services will manage impact of the cut through appropriate internal measures. In another tweet on Wednesday, he criticised the Indian media reaction to the Pakistani military's gesture. ""Indian fake media busy spinning on our internal def budgeting choice. Don't forget, we were the same forces with same budget on 27 Feb 19. We hv the capability & capacity to respond. Remember, it's not budgeting, it's resolve of force & the nation firmly standing behind its forces,"" the military spokesman tweeted. He was apparently refereing to the tensions between India and Pakistan which worsened after a Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) suicide bomber attacked a CRPF convoy in Pulwama in February. Following the terror attack, Indian fighter jets struck a terrorist training camp of the JeM in Pakistan's Balakot on February 26. Pakistan carried out a counter-offensive the next day and downed a MiG-21 in an aerial combat and captured an IAF pilot, who was later handed over to India.

Google homepage showcases a wreath of laurel was placed on Piscopia's head, with a gold ring on her finger, a book of philosophy in her hand and an ermine cape on her shoulders. At the age of thirty-two, Elena became the first woman with a university doctorate, blazing a trail for generations of women to follow in her footsteps into the highest levels of academia. By the time Elena was seven, her parents had recognized her giftedness. A family friend encouraged them to give her lessons in Greek and Latin. She also mastered Hebrew, Spanish, French, and Arabic, while studying the harpsichord, clavichord, harp, and violin. Elena’s later studies also included mathematics and astronomy, but her greatest interest was in philosophy and theology. After becoming president of the Venetian society Accademia dei Pacifici, she enrolled at the University of Padua in 1672. Although she was allowed to study there, Elena’s application for a Doctorate of Theology was rejected, because church officials would not bestow the title on a woman. With her father's support, she applied for a Doctorate of Philosophy. Her oral examination in 1678 attracted so much interest that the ceremony had to be moved from the university to Padua Cathedral to accommodate an audience that included professors, students, senators, and invited guests from Universities all over Italy. Elena spoke in Latin, explaining difficult passages randomly selected from Aristotle’s writings. Her eloquence so impressed the committee that they expressed their approval viva voce rather than by secret ballot. A wreath of laurel was placed on her head, a gold ring on her finger, a book of philosophy in her hand, and an ermine cape upon her shoulders.

It also reduces the possibility of damage on the ground from falling rocket debris. The official Xinhua News Agency cited experts as saying seaborne launch technology will meet the growing demand for launches of low inclination satellites. China's space program has developed rapidly, especially since it conducted its first crewed mission in 2003, becoming just the third country following Russia and the US to put humans into space using its own technology.

Ajay Rana, 35, was found guilty of raping the woman in the back of his housemate's car in the town of Lowestoft in Suffolk, eastern England, after offering her a lift on December, 9, 2017. He then fled to India on December 13 claiming he was visiting his ill mother. He was sentenced at Ipswich Crown Court in Suffolk after being found guilty of rape following a two-week trial and was also ordered to sign the sex offenders' register indefinitely. ""The police investigation commenced following a calculated and sustained attack committed on an innocent victim, who has been left traumatised by the callous actions of this offender,"" said Detective Chief Superintendent Eamonn Bridger, the Senior Investigating Officer for Suffolk Police. ""This was a complicated investigation that was progressed with great haste despite the challenges presented by an offender who fled the country after the attack. The investigation team worked tirelessly over many months to ensure the individual did not escape justice and I am proud of the work they produced to reach the right outcome for the victim,"" Bridger said. By the time UK police identified him as a suspect in the days after the attack, having traced the vehicle he was driving during the attack, Rana had fled to India. Once he was traced to Spain, he was detained by the Spanish police in Bilbao last October on a European Arrest Warrant and was extradited to the UK in November last year after approval from the Spanish courts. During the trial, it emerged that the victim - a woman aged in her 30s - was offered a lift by Rana, saying it was cold and he had just given a lift to two other people, and she accepted. He stopped the car further down and raped the victim in the vehicle. She then managed to get out of the car and ran away to a friend's house nearby to get help, following which the police were called. A major investigation was launched and officers pursued a number of lines of enquiry, including forensic work, along with CCTV and house-to-house enquiries, Suffolk Police said. In a statement read to the court, the victim said the attack ""will haunt me for the rest of my life"". The victim said she had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, had begun self-harming and suffered regular flashbacks, despite receiving counselling. ""I am so angry that he has done this to me, and [the case] brings it all flooding back and the emotions hit me like a roller coaster,"" she said. Rana's car was traced and found to be registered to one of his housemates and he was a named driver on the insurance. On attending Rana's home address and speaking with friends of the suspect, officers were told that he had left for London, saying that he had to go to India as his mother was ill. Police officers located some of Rana's earphones that he had left behind and were then able to match DNA from them with swabs taken from the victim. A CCTV analysis was able to locate Rana's car driving the route through the town as described by the victim and place him in the relevant locations, at times corresponding to when the victim first got into his car and when the attack occurred. Officers from Suffolk Police then began proceedings to extradite Rana from India and also issued a European Arrest Warrant, which would allow for him to be detained if he attempted to enter another European Union (EU) member state and he was ultimately arrested in Spain and extradited. Rana has been remanded in custody in the UK since November last year and will now serve a seven-year sentence at the end of which he is expected to be deported back to India. ""The criminal justice process is never easy for victims of crime, but the victim in this case has shown bravery throughout and continues to be supported by officers and support agencies. I hope that today will bring some kind of closure and allow her to move forward positively in her life,"" said Chief Superintendent Eamonn Bridger. ""Whilst attacks of this nature are rare and Suffolk remains a safe county to live in, this is a further example where the Constabulary has risen to the challenges of modern policing to continue to deliver a highly tenacious and professional service for the public it serves,"" Bridger said.

The multifaceted effort,which started just hours after President Donald Trump last week announced his intentions to impose a 5% tariff on Mexico, aims to get a compromise that avoids such a duty before a Monday deadline. The first critical moment comes Wednesday, when Mexican foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard meets secretary of state Mike Pompeo. And a US administration official told The Associated Press that Vice President Mike Pence will be chairing the meeting at the White House. Trump himself is out of town on a state visit to Britain, though he's fired Twitter shots from across the sea to repeat his vow to impose tariffs unless Mexico takes tougher action to halt migration across its territory to the United States. ""As a sign of good faith, Mexico should immediately stop the flow of people and drugs through their country and to our Southern Border. They can do it if they want!"" he tweeted on June 3 A Mexican official familiar with the bilateral relationship said the lobbying effort includes meetings with members of Congress, think tanks, businessmen, members of Congress, current and former US governors. ""The goal is to gain time and try to deactivate the threat,"" said the official, who requested anonymity for lack of authorization to speak publicly. The official said Mexico was in a ""Catch 22"" situation because while it has stepped up immigration enforcement, it cannot brag publicly about it because of domestic political tensions. ""There is a fine line between what we can say and what we cannot,"" the official added. ""The U.S. knows where we are and keeps pushing. We are between a rock and a hard place."" The issue has allied Mexico's government with influential sectors in the U.S. who say that the tariffs would damage both nations, whose economies are intertwined. Most of Mexico's exports go to the U.S., and Mexico is the United States' top trading partner. Tom Donohue, president of the US Chamber of Commerce, visited the Mexican Embassy on Tuesday and was expected to meet top Mexican businessmen this week. The chamber said recently it was considering legal action to block the tariffs from going into effect. ""These tariffs will be paid by American families and businesses without doing a thing to solve the very real problems at the border,"" said Neil Bradley, the chamber's executive vice president. The Mexican mission also includes Sen. Hector Vasconcelos and Congressman Mario Delgado, and the president of one of Mexico's top business associations, Carlos Salazar Lomelin, former head of Coca Cola FEMSA, one of the country's largest companies. Trump announced his intentions to impose tariffs on Mexico on May 30, the same day Lopez Obrador announced his government was beginning the process of ratifying the new North American trade agreement that had been demanded by Trump. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement would replace the North American Free Trade Agreement and the biggest concerns about ratification had come from congressional Democrats in the U.S. who have questioned how Mexico would enforce labor reforms that strengthen unions. But now Trump's Republican allies also warn that tariffs on Mexican imports would jeopardize the deal. Jorge Guajardo, senior director of the McLarty Associates consulting firm, said that Mexico's swift response signals that it takes the situation seriously, but the mission success relies mostly on Trump's mood. ""There is nothing Mexico or other country can do,"" said Guajardo, who previously was Mexican ambassador to China. Ebrard, meanwhile, has spent an unusually extended time in Washington after arriving over the weekend, meeting with US Cabinet officials and holding news conferences to warn that tariffs would hurt both countries. ""So, what are we doing? Diplomacy. What is Mexico a specialist in? Diplomacy with the United States. Two hundred years,"" Ebrard said with a wide smile.

The Saudi military flew rescue paramedics to the Savis, an Iranian vessel some 95 nautical miles northwest of Yemen's contested port city of Hodeida, spokesman Col. Turki al-Maliki said. They then flew the injured Iranian to a military hospital in Jizan, Maliki said. Iran's mission to the United Nations had made a request to aid the Iranian, Maliki said. The mission did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday. ""The leadership of the joint forces has dealt with the situation according to what is dictated by our Islamic religion and human values, despite the threat represented by this suspect vessel, and the hostile acts it carries out against coalition forces and the interests of the Yemeni people and its continued threats to maritime routes and global trade in the Red Sea,"" Maliki said in a statement Tuesday. The statement did not elaborate. Saudi Arabia and Iran are chief Mideast rivals and the Saudis since 2017 have alleged the Savis served as a maritime base and weapons transshipment point for Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard. Briefing materials from the Saudi military earlier obtained by The Associated Press showed men on the vessel dressed in camouflaged military-style fatigues, as well as small boats capable of ferrying cargo to the Yemeni coast. This is the second time within recent weeks the Saudi government has aided Iran based off a request from its U.N. mission. In May, an Iranian oil tanker carrying more than 1 million barrels of fuel oil suffered a malfunction in the Red Sea off the coast of Saudi Arabia. The kingdom helped the Happiness I reached anchorage off Jiddah, where it still remains. Meanwhile, the White House in May deployed the Lincoln and B-52 bombers to the Persian Gulf over perceived threats from Iran. The U.S. also plans to send 900 additional troops to the Mideast and extend the stay of another 600 as tens of thousands of others also are on the ground across the region. The Mideast crisis takes root in President Donald Trump's withdrawal last year of the U.S. from the 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers that capped Iran's uranium enrichment activities in return for lifting sanctions. Washington subsequently re-imposed sanctions on Iran, sending its economy into freefall. Iran now has said it will begin stepping away from the deal. Amid the escalation, the U.S. alleged without offering evidence that four oil tankers off the coast of the United Arab Emirates were attacked with limpet mines by Iran. Meanwhile, Yemen's Iranian-backed Houthi rebels have launched coordinated drone attacks on Saudi Arabia. The Saudi-led war in Yemen, which began in March 2015, is the world's worst humanitarian crisis. The fighting in the Arab world's poorest country has killed an estimated 60,000 people and left millions suffering from lack of food and medical care.

UN Undersecretary-General Mark Lowcock says about $700 million is needed after a rainless season that has killed both livestock and crops. He said Tuesday that the UN's Central Emergency Response Fund has allocated $45 million to cover food shortages, water and daily necessities in Somalia as well as parts of Kenya and Ethiopia affected by droughts. Of a Somali population of 15 million people, more than 3 million are struggling just to meet minimum food requirements, he said, and the shortages are about 40 percent worse now than this past winter. ""What was forecast to be an average rainy season in Somalia is now one of the driest on record in over 35 years,"" he said. ""Communities that were already vulnerable due to past droughts are again facing severe hunger and water scarcity and are at risk from deadly communicable diseases."" The U.N. aid complements efforts by governments of the three countries to assist their people, especially those with disabilities or who are internally displaced. Somalia's humanitarian fund is currently depleted. If financial aid is delayed, the cost of saving lives on the margin of death are much higher, Lowcock said, adding that the option then is to turn to expensive, therapeutic feeding programs. ""We could have a quick response now, which would be cheaper, reduce human suffering and more effective, or we can wait for a few months until we get all those horrible pictures on our TV screens and social media of starving kids,"" Lowcock said. Lowcock, who heads the U.N. Office for Humanitarian Affairs, said that in past decades droughts came about every half dozen years but recently they have hit every two or three years.

Every year, hundreds of climbers, Sherpas and high altitude porters make their way to Everest, leaving behind tonnes of both biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste on the highest peak, which has lately acquired notoriety as the ""world's highest garbage dump"". There have been attempts in the past to clean up Everest, including a 2014 government-mandated provision making it compulsory for every climber to come down the peak with at least 8 kg of garbage -- the amount of trash estimated to be produced by one climber.

Major General Asif Ghafoor, Director General (DG) Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) — the media wing of the military, in his Twitter message on Tuesday said that voluntary cuts in the defence budget for next fiscal year would not be at the cost of defence and security. ""Voluntary cut in defence budget for a year will not be at the cost of defence & security. We shall maintain effective response potential to all threats. Three services will manage impact of the cut through appropriate internal measures. It was important to participate in development of tribal areas & Balochistan,"" Ghafoor said. However, Ghafoor did not mention how much budget cut would be undertaken. Prime Minister Imran Khan said Tuesday that he was very appreciative of the Pakistan military's ""unprecedented voluntary initiative of stringent cuts in their defence expenditures"" especially in light of the country's financial situation. Khan said he was grateful for the move that came ""despite multiple security challenges"" that Pakistan faces. Khan said that the funds saved will be used for the development of the newly-merged tribal areas as well as in Balochistan. Science and technology minister Fawad Chaudhry said this was ""not a small step at all"". ""Only a strong civilian-military coordination can rescue Pakistan from the deep problems of Governance and economy,"" Chaudhry said. Prime Minister Khan, after assuming office last year, launched several austerity measures. He moved into a modest three-bed room house of his military secretary along with two servants. On May 28, the Prime Minister's special assistant on information, Firdous Ashiq Awan, had announced that the federal budget will be presented on June 11. Last month, the government announced that all civil and military institutions would contribute to the austerity-oriented federal budget for 2019-20. ""There will be austerity in the coming budget. We will try to keep government expenditures to the minimum possible level,"" Prime Minister's adviser on finance and economic affairs Hafeez Shaikh had said. Pakistan in 2018 was the 20th biggest military spender in the world with an expenditure of $11.4 billion, a report published by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri) said in April. The military spending of 2018 made up for four per cent of Pakistan's gross domestic product (GDP) which is the highest level since 2004, according to the report by the Sweden-based institute. The top military spender in the world is the United States, which spent $649 billion on its forces last year. The US military spending, however, has decreased by 17 per cent over the past decade, the report said.

Instead, Saeed, chief of UN-designated terrorist organisation JuD, offered prayers at a local mosque adjacent to his Jauhar Town residence here. ""JuD chief Saeed wanted to lead the Eid prayers at the Qaddafi Stadium but he was conveyed by an official of the Punjab government a day before (Tuesday) that he could not do so. In case he goes ahead with his plan (to lead the Eid prayers) the government may arrest him,” the official privy to the development told PTI. He said Saeed having no other option ""followed the government direction"" and dropped the idea of leading the prayers at the Qaddafi Stadium. Saeed had been leading the prayers on both Eid-ul Fitr and Eid-ul Azha at the Qaddafi Stadium for many years without any hindrance. Rather the government used to provide him foolproof security. In the past Saeed not only led the prayers but also propagated his views especially on Kashmir before a large gathering of people assembled on such religious festivals. Saeed, who was banned on December 10, 2008 by the UN Security Council after the horrific Mumbai attacks in which 166 people were killed, is keeping a low profile since the Imran Khan government launched a crackdown on proscribed organisations some three months ago to fulfil its obligations regarding international terror financing watchdog Financial Action Task Force (FATF). In February, Paris-based international terror financing watchdog FATF decided to continue the 'Grey' listing of Pakistan for its failure to stop funding of terrorist groups such as the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and the JuD. In March, Saeed was barred by the government from delivering weekly Friday sermon at Jamia Masjid Qadsia, the JuD headquarters in Lahore. Saeed was never stopped from delivering Friday sermons even during the years when Masjid Qadsia's control was under the Punjab government. The JuD is believed to be the front organisation for the LeT which is responsible for carrying out the Mumbai attacks. It had been declared as a foreign terrorist organisation by the US in June 2014. The US Department of the Treasury has designated Saeed as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist, and the US, since 2012, has offered a $10 million reward for information that brings him to justice.

At a nearby booth was a flat reproduction of a Van Gogh self-portrait with slightly raised, slicker areas to show both outlines and how brush strokes swept or swirled within those outlines. Museums are working to make their collections more accessible for people with disabilities, said Elizabeth Merritt, vice president for strategic foresight for the alliance, which represents museums of all sorts, from tiny local history museums to huge zoos. Hours when lights and noise levels are kept low for people on the autism spectrum are another example of inclusiveness, she said, as are websites and apps designed to work with screen readers for the blind. Not all touchable art is high-tech. The Singapore Art Museum commissioned three artists to make touchable adaptations of their own works, and plans more. But tech has a big role. 3D Photoworks, of Chatham, New York, was created by photographer John Olson to make his work and other two-dimensional art accessible to the blind and visually handicapped. The company has digital artists carve out contours for scanned art. After the models are created, small metal sensors are added to trigger narrations about the work and the figures within which they’re set. “I’ve never seen anything like that, where it integrates touch and sound,” said Sophie Trist, who has been blind since birth. Without audio, she said, “I wouldn’t have been able to tell the difference between a guitar and a banjo. ...If it were only the sound, it wouldn’t be the full picture, either”. Other high-tech adaptations are 3D models made by the Brooklyn Museum for the “sensory tours” it has held for years for blind or partly sighted patrons. That museum also offers tours with headsets to amplify the guide’s comments as well as tours in American Sign Language. The Louvre commissioned small low-relief models of parts of its exterior for exhibits about the museum’s own eight-century history, said Philippe Moreau of Tactile Studio’s Canada office, which did the work. Though created to give blind and visually handicapped people a look at flat art, the works also offered a new view to the sighted.

It was issued by the foreign ministry, as well as the Chinese Embassy and consulates in the US. The warning comes amid an increasingly bitter trade dispute between the sides and tougher immigration enforcement by the Trump administration.

Trade unions, women's groups, peace campaigners and environmentalists are gathering in the capital to condemn Trump's policies — and Britain's decision to roll out the red carpet for a pomp-filled state visit. Protests began with the flying of a giant blimp depicting the president as an angry orange baby, which rose from the grass of central London's Parliament Square. One group came dressed in the red cloaks and bonnets of characters from Margaret Atwood's ""The Handmaid's Tale,"" which is set in a dystopian, misogynist future America. Leaders of Britain's main opposition party are due to join demonstrators later at a rally in Trafalgar Square, just up the street from May's Downing St. office. Police have erected barricades to stop protesters marching past the gates of Downing St. Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn is due to address the protest, which will be attended by several senior lawmakers from his left-of-center party. Emily Thornberry, Labour's foreign affairs spokeswoman, said Trump was ""a sexual predator"" and a racist who did not deserve the honor of a state visit hosted by Queen Elizabeth II.

"69655332"|"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-administration-halts-cruises-to-cuba-under-new-rules/articleshow/69655332.cms"|"[AP]"|"WASHINGTON: The Trump administration on Tuesday ended the most popular forms of US travel to Cuba, banning cruise ships and a heavily used category of educational travel in an attempt to cut off cash to the island's communist government. Cruise travel from the US to Cuba began in May 2016 during President Barack Obama's opening with the island. It has become the most popular form of US leisure travel to the island, bringing 142,721 people in the first four months of the year, a more than 300% increase over the same period last year. For travelers confused about the thicket of federal regulations governing travel to Cuba, cruises offered a simple, one-stop, guaranteed-legal way to travel. That now appears to be over. ""Cruise ships as well as recreational and pleasure vessels are prohibited from departing the US on temporary sojourn to Cuba effective tomorrow,'' the Commerce Department said in a statement to The Associated Press. The new restrictions are part of a broader effort by the administration of President Donald Trump to roll back the Obama-era efforts to restore normal relations between the United States and Cuba, which drew sharp criticism from the more hardline elements of the Cuban-American community and their allies in Congress. US national security adviser John Bolton, who declared Cuba part of a ""troika of tyranny'' along with Nicaragua and Venezuela as he outlined new sanctions in November, said the new policy is intended to deny the Cuban government a vital source of revenue. ""The Administration has advanced the President's Cuba policy by ending `veiled tourism' to Cuba and imposing restrictions on vessels,'' Bolton said on Twitter. ""We will continue to take actions to restrict the Cuban regime's access to US dollars.'' Cruise lines carrying passengers booked before Tuesday had been hoping that they could request specific federal permits to complete their trips to Cuba, said Pedro Freyre, a Miami-based attorney who represents Carnival and three other major cruise lines. ""For now, it's prohibited unless the cruise lines requests a specific license,'' Freyre said. He said cruise lines had been trying to determine ""if there's any opening there to at least complete trips that have been booked and passengers that have made travel plans.'' Norwegian Cruise Line said in a statement that it was scrutinizing the new rules and consulting with lawyers and trade experts. ""We are closely monitoring these recent developments and any resulting impact to cruise travel to Cuba,'' Norwegian Cruise Line said in a statement. ``We will communicate to our guests and travel partners as additional information becomes available.'' Shore excursions from cruise ships tend to be organized by the cruise lines in cooperation with Cuban government tour agency Havanatur. A smaller number hire private tour guides or drivers of restored classic cars who wait outside Havana's cruise docks. ""This affects all of us,'' said William Martinez, 58, a Cuban-born American who lived in Florida for 46 years but returned five years ago to drive a classic car for tourists. ""It's inhuman, the sanctions that they're putting on Cuba.'' Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the measures are a response to what it calls Cuba's ""destabilizing role'' in the Western Hemisphere, including support for the government of President Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela. ""This administration has made a strategic decision to reverse the loosening of sanctions and other restrictions on the Cuban regime,'' Mnuchin said. ""These actions will help to keep US dollars out of the hands of Cuban military, intelligence, and security services.'' Cruise ships have brought thousands of Americans to Cuba since the US began restoring full diplomatic relations with the communist government in December 2014 and have provided an important economic lifeline to the island. Along with the cruise ships, the US will also now ban most private planes and boats from stopping in the island. ""Consequently, private and corporate aircraft, cruise ships, sailboats, fishing boats, and other similar aircraft and vessels generally will be prohibited from going to Cuba,'' according to the new rules published by the Commerce Department. The new restrictions take effect Wednesday, but the government will allow anyone who has already paid for the trip to go ahead with it. Cruises have become more popular than flights for leisure travelers to Cuba nearly 30,000 more came by cruise ship than flights this year. The figures exclude Cuban-born Americans visiting family on the island. Commercial airline flights appear to be unaffected by the new measures and travel for university groups, academic research, journalism and professional meetings will continue to be allowed. ""It kills the people-to-people category, which is the most common way for the average American to travel to Cuba,'' said Collin Laverty, head of Cuba Educational Travel, one of the largest Cuba travel companies in the US. The new restrictions had been previewed by national security adviser John Bolton in an April speech in Miami to veterans of the failed 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion but details of the changed were public until Tuesday. Treasury said the sanctions would take effect on Wednesday after they are published in the Federal Register.

Protest organisers say 35 people died in the crackdown. Activists turned prayers marking the Eid al-Fitr holiday into political protests, with thousands gathering outside mosques in several neighbourhoods around Khartoum and its twin city, Omdurman, across the Nile River. After prostrating in prayer, some worshippers chanted, ""Freedom, peace, justice and civilian government are the people's choice,"" according to videos posted online. ""We have no choice but to continue our protests and civil disobedience until the fall of the military council,"" said Mohammed Yousef al-Mustafa, a spokesman for the Sudanese Professionals Association, which has spearheaded the protests. The bloody dispersal of the sit-in Monday poses a new challenge to the protest movement, which now aims to show it can keep up pressure in the streets after its central rallying point was wiped out. The movement succeeded in forcing the military in April to remove Sudan's longtime strongman, Omar al-Bashir. It then kept its sit-in going, demanding the generals who took power hand over authority to civilians. Security forces in the city centre barred access to the former site of the sit-in outside the military's headquarters, scene of Monday's violence. But an Associated Press journalist saw protesters building low barricades of stones and metal fencing on some streets in suburbs of Khartoum. Even the date of Eid al-Fitr — a holiday marking the end of the Muslim holy month of fasting, Ramadan — became a centre of contention. The date changes each year by the lunar calendar and is determined by sightings of the new moon. The military announced it would begin Wednesday. But protest leaders said astronomers at Khartoum University had determined that Tuesday was the first day of the holiday and called on supporters to come out to ""pray for the martyrs."" Al-Mustafa accused the military of picking the date so people would stay in their homes fasting on Tuesday, a day after the bloodshed, rather than going to the Eid prayers traditionally held outside. For weeks, the military and protest leaders were negotiating over the make-up of a transitional council meant to run the country for three years before elections. But after Monday's violence, the military council's head, Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, announced it would unilaterally form an interim government and stage elections sooner, within months, and under international supervision. He said any agreements reached in the negotiations were cancelled. A written version of his televised speech released in a statement said elections would be held within seven months, however, in the broadcast, he said elections would be within nine months. The different timelines could not immediately be reconciled. Protesters rejected the move because it would put the military in charge of running the election and reiterated their call for three years of civilian-led authority. ""We are waiting impatiently for elections, but in such a situation, we do not need any military government or any elections,"" one protester, Mohammed Adam Ibrahim, told the AP. Al-Mustafa, of the SPA, called for the international community and the U.N. Security Council not to recognize Burhan or the military authorities and put pressure on the generals to hand over power to a civilian-led authority. The U.N. Security Council is set to discuss the crackdown in Sudan on Tuesday afternoon in a closed-door session requested by the United Kingdom and Germany. Human Rights Watch on Tuesday called for ""an impartial, independent"" U.N inquiry into the deadly crackdown. ""Key international actors should impose targeted punitive sanctions against those responsible,"" said Jehanne Henry, the group's associate Africa director. Burhan has said military leaders would investigate Monday's violence. He didn't mention security forces. He said protest leaders bore blame for the volatile situation because they have been ""extending the negotiations and seeking to exclude other political and security forces"" from participating in any transitional government, accusations rejected by al-Mustafa, the SPA spokesman. Activists said the assault appeared to be a coordinated move, with other forces attacking similar sit-ins in Khartoum's sister city of Omdurman and the eastern city of al-Qadarif. In Cairo, Egypt's national airline, EgyptAir, said it had canceled two flights to Khartoum scheduled for late Monday and Tuesday. The Sudanese Pilots Association, which is part of the Sudanese Professionals Association, said it would take part in a civilian disobedience called for by the protest leaders. The move by the pilots' union could severely affect international flights to Sudan.

The Muslim politicians also protested what they term the government's inability to ensure the safety of their community which constitute 9 per cent of the island's 21 million population. There are 19 Muslims lawmakers in the 225-member Parliament and nine of them held Cabinet, state and deputy ministerial positions. ""Until security of the people is ensured and until investigations are done by the police's Crime Investigations Department (CID) is finalised we will stay as government back benchers,"" Rauff Hakeem, a lawmaker for Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, told reporters. Their resignations came four days after thousands of people, including majority Buddhist community monks, launched a protest in the pilgrim city of Kandy, demanding the expulsion of three Muslim leaders whom they alleged were linked to the National Thowheeth Jamaath (NTJ) - the banned outfit blamed for the attacks on three Colombo hotels and three churches. Following the April 21 attacks that claimed 258 lives, some Muslim politicians representing the government came under criticism for their alleged support extended to the rising Muslim militancy. Industry and commerce minister Rishath Bathiyutheen was accused of supporting the ISIS linked NTJ. The Sinhala majority nationalists were demanding the sacking of Bathiyutheen. The opposition moved a motion of no confidence in the Parliament against Bathiyutheen, who has denied links to the NTJ and its terror activities. In the wake of the bombings, majority Sinhala community mobs attacked Muslim-owned properties in towns north of the capital killing one Muslim man and leaving hundreds of homes, shops and mosques vandalised. ""We took this decision (to resign) as a responsible community who is keen on ensuring reconciliation and peace in the country,"" said Kabir Hashim, a senior minister. He said since the Easter Sunday attacks, the Muslim community had volunteered to give information on the NTJ. Hakeem said the Muslim community is concerned over the arrests of some innocent Muslims for alleged connections to the Easter Sunday attacks. He said that police must hold a proper inquiry and punish anyone if the terror group had been supported by them. Western Province Governor Azath Salley and Eastern Province governor MALM Hisbullah, handed over their resignation letters to President Maithripala Sirisena in response to protests by the Buddhist monks, officials said. Salley and Hisbullah, both Muslim allies of Sirisena and appointed by him, were under pressure to resign after being accused of being linked to extremism. Both Salley and Hisbullah have rejected the allegations. Buddhist monk Athuraliye Rathana, who is also a parliamentarian from a Sirisena allied party, staged a hunger strike in the central town of Kandy near the foremost Buddhist shrine, the Temple of Tooth. ""I will end my fast only after the president will sack the two Muslim governors,"" Rathana said at the commencement of his protest. A crowd of about 10,000 Buddhists held demonstration at the famous temple on Monday morning raising anti-Muslim slogans. Firebrand monk Galagodaaththe Gnanasara, released from jail on a presidential pardon last month, was also present. Gnanasara has long been accused of instigating hate crimes against Muslims. The head of the Catholic Church in Colombo, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, also travelled to Kandy on Monday to express solidarity with Rathana. Shops and offices remained closed in the city, 115 kilometres east of Colombo, while black flags were raised in support of Rathana.

North Korean publications on Monday showed Kim Yong Chol sitting five seats away from a clapping Kim Jong Un in the same row along with other top officials during a musical performance by the wives of Korean People's Army officers. Kim Yong Chol has been North Korea's top nuclear negotiator and the counterpart of US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo since Kim Jong Un entered nuclear talks with the US early last year. He traveled to Washington and met President Donald Trump twice before Kim's two summits with Trump. Negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang have been at a standstill since February, when the second summit between Trump and Kim broke down over what the United States described as excessive North Korean demands for sanctions relief in exchange for only a partial surrender of its nuclear capabilities. South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo last week cited an unidentified source to report that Kim Yong Chol had been sentenced to hard labor and ideological re-education over the failed summit in Hanoi. The newspaper also reported that senior envoy Kim Hyok Chol, who was involved in pre-summit working-level talks with American officials, was executed with four other officials from the North's foreign ministry for betraying Kim Jong Un after being won over by the United States. South Korea's government and media have a mixed record on tracking developments among North Korea's ruling elite, made difficult by Pyongyang's stringent control of information about them. Lee Sang-min, spokesman of Seoul's Unification Ministry, which deals with inter-Korean affairs, said the ministry would not comment on a ""specific internal event in North Korea or its participants"" when asked about Kim Yong Chol's reappearance in public. Seoul's spy service has said it could not confirm Friday's report of a possible purge, while the presidential Blue House cautioned against ""hasty judgments or comments."" US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters in Berlin that he had seen the report and the US was ""doing our best to check it out."" The report came at a delicate time for diplomacy as North Korea in past weeks has tested short-range missiles and issued belligerent rhetoric toward American and South Korean officials. Kim Jong Un declared in April that the Trump administration has until the end of the year to come up with mutually acceptable terms for a deal to salvage the negotiations. Experts say the North is playing measured brinkmanship aimed at increasing pressure on Washington without actually causing the nuclear negotiations to collapse. North Korea has previously executed scapegoats to atone for high-profile political flops. But while many experts believe Kim Yong Chol was pushed to a back seat in negotiations with the United States, there were doubts about the report of a purge. Cheong Seong-Chang, an analyst at South Korea's Sejong Institute, said Kim Yong Chol, who is also rumored to have health problems, wouldn't have appeared in public this quickly if he was undergoing political re-education. Chang said it wouldn't make sense for Kim Jong Un to execute Kim Hyok Chol when Kim Yong Chol, the more senior official, would be seen as more responsible for the failure in Hanoi. ""If Kim Jong Un sentences senior officials to hard labor, executes them, or puts them in political prison camps over the collapse of meetings, then no official would be willing to step up in external negotiations,"" Chang said. ""It's unlikely that Kim would issue extreme punishment unless he's giving up on the talks with the United States."" Kim Yong Chol's rise during the nuclear negotiations had baffled many North Korea watchers because he handled South Korea ties, not international or US relations. Previously, he was a military intelligence chief believed to be behind a slew of provocations, including two deadly attacks in 2010 that killed 50 South Koreans and an alleged 2014 cyberattack on Sony Pictures. Both Seoul and Washington imposed sanctions on him in recent years. Many experts in South Korea believe experienced foreign ministry hands such as foreign minister Ri Yong Ho and first vice-foreign minister Choe Son Hui are likely to take the lead in North Korea's nuclear diplomacy as it prepares for the possibility of protracted and highly complicated negotiations with Washington.

The Lewis Chessmen - a famous hoard of 93 objects - were discovered in 1831 on the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides. But the whereabouts of five pieces from the collection have remained a mystery, the BBC reported. A family has now been told the chess piece their grandfather bought for just 5 pounds in 1964 is one of the missing treasures. The antiques dealer, from Edinburgh, had no idea of the significance of the 8.8cm piece, made from walrus ivory, which he passed down to his family. They have looked after it for 50 years without realising its importance, before bringing it to Sotheby's auction house in London, the report said. The Lewis Chessmen are among the biggest draws at the British Museum and the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh. They are seen as an ""important symbol of European civilisation"" and have also seeped into popular culture, inspiring everything from children's show Noggin The Nog to part of the plot in Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone. Sotheby's expert Alexander Kader, who examined the piece for the family, said that his ""jaw dropped"" when he realised what they had in their possession. ""They brought it in for assessment. That happens everyday. Our doors are open for free valuations,"" he said. ""I said, 'Oh my goodness, it's one of the Lewis Chessmen'."" He said the family, who want to remain anonymous, were ""quite amazed"". ""It's a little bit bashed up. It has lost its left eye. But that kind of weather-beaten, weary warrior added to its charm,"" he said. Despite not knowing its significance, the late 12th/early 13th century chess piece had been ""treasured"" by the family. The Lewis Chessmen comprise of seated kings and queens, bishops, knights and standing warders and pawns. Some 82 pieces are now in the British Museum and 11 pieces held by the National Museum of Scotland. As well as the chess pieces, the hoard includes 14 'tablemen' gaming pieces and a buckle. Since the hoard was uncovered in 1831, one knight and four warders have been missing from the four combined chess sets. The newly discovered piece is a warder, a man with helmet, shield and sword and the equivalent of a rook on a modern chess board, which ""has immense character and power"". The Lewis Warder piece will go up for auction, with an estimate of 600,000 pounds to 1 million pounds, in the Old Master Sculpture & Works of Art sale at Sotheby's in London on July 2.

Inspector-General Pujith Jayasundara was sent on compulsory leave by Sirisena for his alleged inaction on the intelligence shared by India, which warned of an impending attack by Islamic militants, and thereby, failing to prevent the serial blasts on April 21. In the petition submitted to the court last week, Jayasundara revealed serious lack of communication between intelligence agencies and security arms of the government, all which fall under Sirisena, and claimed he was sidelined and excluded from attending National Security Council meetings since a political rift between the president and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe emerged in October last year. In October 2018, Sirisena sacked Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. The police was under the control of Wickremesinghe. In the 20-page complaint, the former police chief said Sirisena had asked Nilantha Jayawardena, the head of the State Intelligence Service (SIS) -- country's premier spy agency, to report directly to the president on matters of national security. Jayasundara claimed despite having intelligence inputs from India about an impending attack, the SIS chief did not take the warning seriously and take any action on it. On April 9, Jayasundara said he received a letter from Sisira Mendis, the chief of national intelligence, giving information on the planned attack. He also received a phone call from the Secretary to the then defence minister Hemasiri Fernando on the impending attacks. Fernando was also sacked by Sirisena for his alleged failure to prevent the attacks. The former Inspector-General claimed despite the SIS not sharing security warning information with the police department, he alerted Jayawardena about the impending threat but the SIS head did not ask him to take any action. More than 250 people were killed in eight coordinated suicide bomb attacks carried out by local Jihadi group National Thowheed Jammath (NTJ) linked to the ISIS on April 21. Two days after the attacks, Jayasundara said, Sirisena asked him to take the responsibility for the failure to prevent the bombings and step down in exchange for a diplomatic posting. However, he refused to do so following which Sirisena sacked him ""illegally"". Earlier on Thursday, Sirisena said he was not privy to an intelligence warning on the Easter suicide bombings, contradicting the national intelligence chief Mendis' testimony before a parliamentary probe panel. During a visit to New Delhi last week to attend Prime Minister Narendra Modi's swearing-in ceremony, Sirisena said a clear report about a possible terror attack was sent by Indian intelligence agencies to their Sri Lankan counterparts 17 days prior to the April 21 bombings but he was not informed about it. ""Had I known about a possible attack, I would have taken necessary steps to prevent it,"" Sirisena said. Sirisena said he left for a foreign trip on April 16 and till then he was not informed about the Indian intelligence report, though there had been exchanges on the issue between the defence secretary and the then inspector general of police. ""Had I known it, I would not have left the country,"" he had said. A parliamentary select committee was appointed to probe the events leading to the April 21 attacks and any lapses by those responsible following reports that India had alerted the Sri Lankan defence establishment on the impending attacks. Testifying before the committee on Wednesday, Mendis said that at an intelligence coordination meeting on April 9 discussed the information received on the impending attacks, however, it ""was never a main point for discussion"".

Hundreds of thousands of Muslims are held in re-education camps without charge, student activists face relentless harassment and leaders in the beleaguered dissident community have been locked up or simply vanished. Religious groups face ever greater pressure to conform, and a web of mass surveillance is bolstering a system many call totalitarian. It's a far cry from the hopes of the idealistic student demonstrators, and a level of control far beyond what many imagined possible, even after the army's bloody crushing of the protests on the night of June 3-4, 1989. Critics say the Tiananmen crackdown, which left hundreds, possibly thousands, dead, set the ruling Communist Party on its present course of ruthless suppression, summary incarceration and the frequent use of violence against opponents in the name of ""stability maintenance."" ""The June 4 incident changed the direction of Chinese history,"" said Zhang Lifan, who in 1989 was a scholar at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. ""The narrative that China would grow strong and normal, become a stable country through a process of political reform, was destroyed."" Chinese officials routinely respond to questions about the suppression by pointing to the economic progress China has made. In the three decades since the protests, China has risen to become the world's second-largest economy and is forging ahead in areas from high-speed rail to artificial intelligence and 5G mobile communications. China's navy now sails around the globe, its space program has launched half a dozen crewed missions and its sprawling cross-border infrastructure projects are extending its influence from Nairobi to the Netherlands. Politically, however, the state has never been more repressive. Restrictions on freedom of speech have been extended from publishing into social media, and the slightest act of perceived defiance can prompt a near instantaneous response from the authorities. The sprawling domestic security apparatus operates with impunity, coerced confessions are broadcast on state television and prison sentences are handed out on the flimsiest of charges, including ""picking quarrels"" and ""incitement to subversion."" Calls for even moderate reforms have been attacked or just ignored. An attempt to introduce grass-roots democracy at the village level years ago foundered after the Communist Party refused to concede even a modicum of control. Deliberative bodies at all levels are filled with party appointees who vote how they're told, and the national legislature is a mere rubber stamp body, re-electing president and party head Xi Jinping last year by a margin of 2,970 to 0. Regarded as China's most powerful leader in a generation, Xi took the opportunity to amend the constitution and remove presidential term limits, making him president-for-life if he so chooses. While the party is believed to be rife with power struggles, Xi's ongoing anti-corruption campaign and the threat of heavy prison sentences keep his opponents in check. In the wake of the Tiananmen crackdown, efforts to supervise the party's workings and control corruption through the media and public oversight were lost, Zhang said. While it ushered in the era of new party leader Jiang Zemin under which the economy grew, graft also became endemic, faith in communism was exhausted and interpersonal relationships revolved around sheer personal gain, essentially finishing off what the violent, radical Cultural Revolution had begun almost 20 years earlier, he said. ""The moment the government ordered its army to fire on its own people, it lost its legitimacy,"" said Rowena Xiaoqing He, a former Tiananmen protester who teaches about the movement at St. Michael's College in Vermont and is a visiting scholar at Princeton. ""Of course, those in power can easily manipulate history and twist our memory. But that kind of manipulation and suppression of history is always followed by distortions of all kinds — social, political, psychological,"" He said. ""It is indeed impossible to understand today's China without understanding the spring of 1989."" Speaking at a regional defense forum in Singapore on Sunday, Chinese defense minister Wei Fenghe defended the government's response to the protests, drawing the stock link to China's post-1989 development. ""How can we say that China didn't handle that Tiananmen incident appropriately? There is a conclusion of that incident, that incident was political turbulence and the central government took measures to stop the turbulence, which is a correct policy,"" Feng said. Given that unbending official line, hopes for a re-evaluation of the crushing of the 1989 protests seem incredibly distant, despite the lack of any direct personal connection to that decision among the current ranks of leaders. Revisiting the episode, meanwhile, could undermine party prestige and authority among a younger generation who know only relative prosperity and little or nothing of the events of 1989. While China has sought to rally the public with appeals to patriotism and the ideals of the communist revolution that swept the Communist Party to power in 1949, their belief system seems hollow at the core. In an ironic twist, the Communist Party seems truly disconcerted by young people who remain true believers in Marxism for China. A harsh crackdown on members of the Marxist student society at prestigious Peking University is one of the most extreme examples of the regime's insecurity and willingness to trample basic human rights. The school, whose Communist Party secretary — its top leader — was recently replaced by a former head of the national spy agency's branch in Beijing, has stood by as security agents have beaten, harassed and forcibly removed students who joined in the club's activities, including seeking solidarity with workers by joining them on the assembly line. ""I think the government has been very concerned about another round of student activists staging mass demonstrations. That's why they are being so nervous about students getting involved in protest,"" said Patrick Poon, China researcher for Amnesty International in Hong Kong. China's domestic security spending now outstrips its defense budget, constituting an ever-growing strain on finances as the economy slows — from double digits to just 6.6% last year, a three-decade low. In addition, 20% of the defense budget is spent on the People's Armed Police, the internal security force. Yet more initiatives are in the works, in particular the ""social credit"" system of mass date collection that monitors every citizen's digital, economic and social behavior and can limit access to everything from job offers to train tickets. Still, China ranks far down in global rankings for political stability and absence of violence, below countries such as Sri Lanka, Greece and Moldova in 2017. Numbers of protests listed as ""mass incidents"" run into the tens of thousands each year. With the party having shut off all channels for organized opposition or even calls for inner-party reform, Zhang, the scholar, says he sees only two scenarios under which China might be able to ""overturn the verdict"" on Tiananmen. One would be during a time of supreme economic and political confidence, offering a chance to ""pay off this historical debt,"" he said. The other would be in the case of an existential crisis, when the regime was ""grasping at straws."" The opportunity for the first option has already passed because of constant infighting for political influence and the economy on decline, partly because of the trade war with the US, Zhang said. The second scenario ""has yet to come to pass."" Despite the setback it dealt to Chinese political reform, the crackdown may have had a salutary effect on events elsewhere, hurrying the peaceful fall of the Berlin Wall the same year and the dissolution of the Soviet Union soon after, Zhang said. ""So even though the Chinese people didn't benefit from it, the rest of the world felt the impact,"" he said.

Bilel Kabaoui, 32, and Mourad Delhomme, 41, join nine other French citizens and a Tunisian national already on death row after trials over the past week. They have 30 days to appeal the sentences. The group was handed over to Iraqi authorities early this year by a US-backed force in Syria which expelled IS from its last bastion. On the stand in Baghdad, Delhomme said he was ""known within IS as the one who never pledged allegiance or worked"" for the ultra-extremist group. For an hour, the man who went by Abu Ayman explained to the judge in great detail how he entered Syria to save the wife of a friend taken captive by rebels after her husband died fighting in the ranks of IS. Although he denied it at trial, Delhomme told investigators he joined the Tariq Ibn Ziyad brigade, an IS unit described by US officials as ""a European foreign terrorist fighter cell"". The group was charged with carrying out attacks in Iraq and Syria and planning others in Paris and Brussels. Iraq has convicted more than 500 foreign men and women of joining IS since the start of 2018. Its courts have condemned many to life in prison and others to death, although no foreign IS members have yet been executed. Kabaoui, for his part, pleaded the error of youth.

He claimed he asked his family in France to contact French intelligence to find a way for him to return with his wife and three children -- it was on that advice that he surrendered to US-backed Kurdish forces in Syria in late 2017. France has long insisted its adult citizens captured in Iraq or Syria must face trial before local courts, while stressing its opposition to capital punishment. French government spokeswoman Sibeth Ndiaye reiterated Sunday that officials were intervening ""at the highest level"" in the cases. On Sunday, France's state secretary at the interior ministry Laurent Nunez said ""other (French citizens) could be tried"" in Iraq. ""I cannot give you the exact numbers but we will have others,"" he said. Some 450 French nationals accused of links to IS are currently detained in Syria. Iraq offered in April to put on trial hundreds of accused foreign jihadists in Baghdad in exchange for millions of dollars, potentially solving a legal conundrum for Western governments but also sparking rights concerns. A group of prominent French lawyers said on Monday that the execution of French jihadists on death row would be a disgrace for France. ""We have taken a historic risk, which, if it is realised, will leave an indelible stain on the mandate of (President) Emmanuel Macron,"" said the lawyers, including some of the country's best known legal professionals such as William Bourdon, Henri Leclerc and Vincent Brengarth. It would mean allowing a ""legal assassination which is now proscribed by the majority of countries on the planet,"" said the open letter, published on the website of radio station Franceinfo. Human Rights Watch, for its part, has accused Iraqi interrogators of ""using a range of torture techniques... which would not leave lasting marks on the person's body"". It also condemned France's ""outsourcing"" of trials of IS suspects to ""abusive justice systems"" and criticised Iraq's ""routine failure... to credibly investigate torture allegations"". Iraqi law provides for the death penalty, which is carried out by hanging, for anyone joining a ""terrorist group"" -- even those who did not take up arms.

Pakistan has already indicated that it may lift the airspace ban along its eastern border with India, imposed on February 27 after the Balakot airstrike, to reciprocate India's decision to remove all restrictions on all air routes in the Indian airspace. ""We have already opened this point, Telem (near Ahmedabad), about two months ago, for India. It was India that has to open it now, enabling the flights to use this airspace,"" the Pakistani government official told PTI. He said since there is no official communication between the two countries in this respect taken place yet ""we will see what Notam (notice to airmen) it (India) issues today."" When asked about opening of other around 10 routes (points), the official said: ""Once the Indian government lifts the air restriction on Pakistani flights on these routes, Pakistan will certainly follow suit."" It is expected that these points will gradually be opened this month. The Indian Air Force (IAF) on Friday said that temporary restrictions on all air routes in the Indian airspace, imposed by it on February 27, have been removed. The IAF said it had removed restrictions that were imposed on all routes a day after its 12 Mirage 2000s crossed over to Pakistan and conducted air strikes in Balakot. Pakistan fully closed its airspace on February 27. On March 27, Pakistan opened its airspace for all flights except for New Delhi, Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur. On May 30, Pakistan extended its airspace ban for flights to India till June 15. As a result of the ban, foreign carriers using Indian airspace have been forced to take costly detours because they cannot fly over Pakistan. The closure mainly affects flights from Europe to Southeast Asia. The flights from Europe and the US flying in and out of New Delhi have been the worst hit. Since Pakistan's airspace closure, the airfare on many routes have gone up significantly, including Delhi-Kabul, Delhi-Moscow, Delhi-Tehran and Delhi-Astana. Two Indian airline companies, Air India and SpiceJet, have already stopped their Delhi-Kabul flights due to Pakistan airspace closure. Pakistan had given a special permission to India for then external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj to fly directly through Pakistani airspace to attend the SCO meet in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, on May 21. However, the airspace for other commercial airliners remains closed.

Speaking at an annual security conference in Singapore, Gen. Wei Fenghe did not direct the threat at the U.S. but loaded his address with criticism of activities by Washington, including support for Taiwan and leading so-called freedom of navigation operations in the strategic waterways that China virtually claims as its own. Wei said the People's Liberation Army would not ""yield a single inch of the country's sacred land."" China's ruling Communist Party maintains that Taiwan is part of China, and has used increasingly aggressive rhetoric toward the democratic island, which split from the mainland amid a civil war 70 years ago. It opposes Taiwan's independence and formally says it seeks a ""peaceful reunification"" while refusing to rule out the use of force if necessary to achieve that goal. ""The PLA has no intention to cause anybody trouble but it is not afraid to face up to troubles. Should anybody risk crossing the bottom line, the PLA will resolutely take action and defeat all enemies,"" Wei said. Relations between Beijing and Taipei have deteriorated since Taiwan elected a pro-independence president, Tsai Ing-wen, in 2016. China has since increased diplomatic pressure, cut off its contacts with the island's government and discouraged travel there by Chinese tourists. ""China must be and will be reunified. We find no excuse not to do so. If anyone dares to split Taiwan from China, the Chinese military has no choice but to fight at all costs, at all costs, for national unity,"" Wei stressed. ""We will strive for the prospect of peaceful unification with utmost sincerity and greatest efforts, but we make no promise to renounce the use of force."" Wei was addressing defense chiefs, officials and academics at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore. U.S. Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, who spoke to the same gathering on Saturday, was not present at Wei's speech. Shanahan called China's efforts to steal technology from other nations and militarize man-made outposts in the South China Sea a ""toolkit of coercion"" and urged it to stop activities the U.S. perceives as hostile. China is pitted against smaller Southeast Asian neighbors in multiple disputes over island reefs, corals and lagoons in the South China Sea, where it constructed seven outposts equipped with airstrips, radar and missile stations that Shanahan said Saturday could become ""tollbooths"" in one of the world's busiest waterways. Beijing is currently firming up a pact with four rival claimants, containing norms and rules aimed at preventing a shooting war in the disputed waters. On Thursday, China's Defense Ministry dismissed a report that Australian navy pilots were hit by lasers earlier in May while exercising in the waters claimed by China. And on Sunday, Beijing closed off an area near Paracel Islands, which is also claimed by Vietnam and Taiwan, for military training exercises. Wei said China built ""limited defense facilities"" but much of it was aimed at improving services and infrastructure for people living there. ""It is only when there are threats would there be defenses. In face of heavily armed warships and military aircraft, how can we not deploy any defense facilities?"" he said. Most of the islands are uninhabited and have been used by fishermen from all sides to shelter during storms. Wei and Shanahan met on the sidelines of the conference Friday and agreed to improve communication and deepen exchanges and cooperation between their militaries. On Sunday, Wei said the countries recognize that a conflict or war between them would have wide-reaching effects. ""It takes two to cooperate but only one to start a fight,"" he said. ""We hope that the U.S. side will work with us towards the same goal, follow the principles of non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation, and steer the China-US relations in the right direction."" China last sent a high-ranking general to the conference in 2011. Its officials have been quick to downplay this as a mere coincidence, given the busy schedules of their higher-ups. But some observers see Wei's presence this time as a pointed attempt by China to cement its relationships in the region amid a trade war with the US and having its businesses targeted with sanctions.

Francis presided over the eastern rite beatification Mass Sunday in Blaj, a stronghold of the Greek-Catholic Church that was outlawed during communism. The seven bishops had been arrested and imprisoned between 1950 and 1970 for adhering to their faith. Francis is expected to hold them up as models for the Romanian faithful today. Sunday's Mass marked the first time that Francis has ever presided over an eastern rite liturgy as pope, the Vatican said. The Mass is being celebrated on the symbolic ""Field of Liberty,"" a huge expanse east of Blaj that was the site of an important nationalist rally in 1848. A century later, communist leaders marking the anniversary at the field demanded that Greek-Catholics join the Orthodox church. Many refused, and thousands of priests were incarcerated in communist prisons, including the seven being beatified Sunday. The Catholic Church's property was seized. The refusal of the Orthodox church to return Catholic assets remains a source of tension between the two today. ""This is a holy day for all Catholics,"" said 50-year old Emanuela Canta, who arrived in the Blaj field early Sunday to get a spot. ""I wish we could share the same kind of faith they (the martyrs) had. I wish God could strengthen us and our belief."" It was Francis' second visit to Transylvania, after he celebrated Mass on Saturday at the Sumuleu Ciuc shrine in the Carpathian mountains, the most important pilgrimage site in Romania dedicated to the Virgin Mary. Francis is travelling across Romania to visit its far-flung Catholic communities. The unusually thorough single-country itinerary is making up for the fact that St. John Paul II was only allowed to visit the capital, Bucharest, in 1999 in the first papal visit to a majority Orthodox country since the Great Schism divided Christianity. After Mass in Blaj, Francis will meet with people from the disadvantaged Roma minority before returning to the Vatican.

It was the monarch's strongest words yet since tensions spiked in recent weeks between the two regional heavyweights. Iran had a representative present at the 57-nation summit of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, or OIC, but its top leadership did not attend. The Islamic summit drew political figures and heads of state from countries spanning Africa, the Middle East and Asia. They come with widely varying policies and priorities, but share a common reverence for the Al-Aqsa mosque in east Jerusalem, known as the first ""Qibla"" because Muslims prayed toward it before the cube-shaped Kaaba in Mecca. Despite sharp differences between OIC member-states on a gamut of issues, a final statement by the group stressed support for a future Palestinian state, as well as the rejection of any deal or plan that prolongs Israeli occupation and undermines the right of return for Palestinian refugees. The language stood in contradiction to the Trump administration's decision to move the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in recognition of it as Israel's capital, as well as a still undisclosed White House plan already rejected by the Palestinian leadership. Glimpses of the plan suggest it sidelines or ignores the longstanding goal of Palestinian independence. A meeting next month in Bahrain aimed at rallying Arab economic support for the plan is being boycotted by the Palestinian authority, but Saudi Arabia and the UAE are attending amid growing ties with Israel in the face of shared enemy Iran. The US recently sent an aircraft carrier and B-52 bombers to the Persian Gulf as tensions run high. The escalation stems from the Trump administration's decision to withdraw the US from Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers last year and impose crippling economic sanctions on the country. Speaking to leaders from OIC countries, King Salman opened the summit saying the world must fight the sources and funding of terrorism around the world. He then said the alleged sabotage of four oil tankers off the coast of the United Arab Emirates in past weeks represents a ""grave danger"" to the security of maritime traffic and regional security. He blamed Iranian-backed terrorist militias of being behind a subsequent drone attack on a Saudi oil pipeline. ""We emphasize that these subversive terrorist acts are aimed not only at the kingdom and the Gulf region, but also on the security of navigation and energy supplies to the world,"" King Salman said. Iran denies being involved in the incidents. Iran's President Hassan Rouhani had his own message for OIC leaders ahead of the summit, urging them to stay focused on the rights of Palestinians. In a letter published online on Friday, Rouhani said Muslim leaders should not let the importance of Palestinian statehood be ""marginalized"" in the face of the Trump administration's forthcoming Israeli-Palestinian plan. Rouhani also noted in the letter he was not invited to the Islamic summit, but expressed Iran's readiness to work with all Muslim leaders to confront the White House's so-called ""Deal of the Century."" King Salman told OIC leaders that the rights of Palestinians remains the cornerstone issue of the organization, which was formed 50 years ago in response to an extremist arson attack on the Al-Aqsa Mosque in east Jerusalem, one of Islam's most sacred sites. He said the mosque remains under occupation and threat. ""We reiterate with emphasis the rejection of any measures that infringe upon the legal status of Al-Quds Al-Sharif,"" King Salman said, referring to east Jerusalem and the mosque compound. Turkey's foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said any peace deal that does not include an independent and sovereign Palestinian state along 1967 borders with east Jerusalem as its capital will be rejected by the OIC body. ""We shall not accept the rewriting of history, exchanging justice with economic benefits and disregarding dignity and legitimacy,"" he told the OIC summit. The meeting began after midnight and ran into the early hours of Saturday due to evening prayers and day-long fasting during the holy month of Ramadan. Saudi Arabia's effort to bring leaders to Mecca reflects the kingdom's desire to project a unified Muslim and Arab position on Iran to isolate it internationally. Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said Tehran regrets ""Saudi Arabia's abuse of its privilege as the host"" of the OIC ""to sow division between Islamic and regional countries."" The summit follows two emergency Arab meetings the night before in Mecca criticizing Iran's behaviour and influence in countries like Syria, Iraq and Lebanon. Presenting a unified stance on Iran faces obstacles within OIC member-states, which includes Iran. Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan, who is attending the summit, has sought good ties with both Saudi Arabia and Iran, for example. The leader of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah group told supporters in Lebanon on Friday the Mecca summits are a Saudi call for help from Arab countries after Saudi Arabia failed to win in Yemen, where the kingdom and its allies have been at war since 2015 against Iranian-allied Yemeni rebels. ""It is a sign of failure,"" Hassan Nasrallah said. ""These summits are calls for help ...that express the failure and the inabilities in confronting the Yemeni army, popular resistance and people.""

On Monday, three terrorists belonging to the Islamic State (IS) and Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LeJ) militant groups were arrested by the CTD officials in Pakistan's Punjab province. Last week, six activists of the JeM and the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LeJ) were arrested by the CTD from Gujranwala, Rawalpinid, Multan and Lahore for allegedly collecting funds to finance terrorism. Paris-based international terror financing watchdog FATF in June last year placed Pakistan onto its watch list in a bid to push the country to halt support for militant groups. In February, the FATF decided to continue the 'Grey' listing of Pakistan for its failure to stop funding of terrorist groups such as the JeM, the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and the JuD. The Pakistan government arrested over 100 members of banned outfits including JeM chief Azhar's son and brother and also taken control of JeM, JuD and FIF's properties including seminaries and mosques across the country.

Talking about the attacks which claimed over 250 lives, Sirisena said he was in Singapore when the terror strikes happened. “A clear report had been sent from Indian agencies to state agencies of Sri Lanka about the possibility of attack on April 4.

None of the defence chiefs informed me. Had I known, I would never have left the country. Had I been aware I would have taken steps to prevent it. This was a matter of great shock. I have removed the defence secretary and inspector general of police. On April 22, I set up an investigation committee to identify shortcomings of our security services.

The religious authority in charge of the compound, the third holiest site in Islam, said in total 260,000 worshippers took part in the midday prayers. The prayers came only hours after a Palestinian teenager stabbed two Israelis inside the Old City before being shot dead by Israeli security. In a separate incident, another Palestinian teenager was shot dead by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank as he sought to sneak into Jerusalem, reportedly to pray at Al-Aqsa. In Jerusalem itself, a 19-year-old Palestinian stabbed one Israeli near the Damascus Gate and another near Jaffa Gate on the other side of the walled Old City, police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld said. ""Police units that responded at the scene saw the attacker with a knife. The attacker was shot and killed,"" Rosenfeld said. The Palestinian health ministry later named him as Yusef Wajih from Abwein village in the central West Bank. A video released by police showed a man running through the streets and stabbing two Orthodox Jews. One of the Israeli wounded was a 16-year-old boy who was stabbed at the exit of a synagogue. A photograph of the teenager in a hospital bed was released by a government spokesman. The other victim, a 47-year-old man, was in serious condition, according to the hospital. The Old City has been the scene of numerous stabbings of Israelis by Palestinian assailants in recent years, though a relative calm has existed for several months. After the latest attack, gates to the Old City were briefly sealed before being reopened as thousands thronged towards the mosque. Inside the mostly uncovered mosque compound, water was sprayed on worshippers to keep them cool in the baking Jerusalem sun, with temperatures approaching 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit). Despite a heavy police presence, there were no reports of further incidents. Rosenfeld said increased security presence would ""continue throughout the afternoon and evening."" The Al-Aqsa mosque compound is a key religious and political symbol for Palestinians. It is also sacred for Jews, who refer to it at the Temple Mount. The attack came just two days before Israelis hold a major march to mark Jerusalem Day, the annual commemoration of the capture of east Jerusalem in the Six-Day War of 1967. It was later annexed in a move not recognised by the international community. In December 2017, US President Donald Trump broke with decades of bipartisan policy to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital in a move that prompted the Palestinians to cut all contacts with his administration. Israel insists the whole of Jerusalem is its ""eternal, indivisible capital"". The Palestinians demand the city's eastern sector as the capital of their long promised state. On Thursday evening, Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem as part of a Middle East tour before Washington unveils its long-awaited plan for Israel-Palestinian peace. Kushner, accompanied by Trump envoy Jason Greenblatt, arrived in Jerusalem after earlier stops in Morocco and Jordan. He is a key architect of the peace plan that the White House says it intends to present in the coming weeks. But the plan, previously delayed for an Israeli general election on April 9, could face further postponements due to Israeli politics. Israel is set to hold another general election in September after Netanyahu failed to form a coalition government, and the plan is widely seen as too sensitive an issue to introduce during a political campaign. The Palestinian leadership has rejected the peace plan without seeing it, saying Trump has shown himself to be blatantly biased in favour of Israel. They cite moves including declaring the disputed city of Jerusalem Israel's capital and cutting hundreds of millions of dollars in Palestinian aid. Trump has also handed Netanyahu other diplomatic coups, notably US recognition of Israel's 1981 annexation of the strategic Golan Heights captured from Syria in the Six-Day War. On Thursday, Kushner delivered Netanyahu a gift from Trump, a map of Israel signed and approvingly annotated by the US president showing the Golan as inside the Jewish state's borders. lal-mab-jod/lal/rsc/dco Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."|"260,000 pray at Jerusalem mosque on final Friday of Ramdan"|"Fri May 31 23:09:00 CEST 2019"|"[world]"

The diplomatic tax exemption programme - usually granted to foreign diplomats and consulars - provides sales and use, occupancy, food, airline, gas, and utility tax exemptions to eligible foreign officials on assignment in the Unites States. The facility is enjoyed by the officials' dependents too. The decision to take back the special tax exemption cards issued to the Pakistani officials was made on May 15, after which the affected staffers had to surrender the privilege, The News International reported from Washington. The number of affected staffers of the Pakistani embassy are a little over 20, the report said. Tax exemption privileges for foreign diplomats, consular officers and staff members are generally based on two international treaties: The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. Since all such services and privileges are based on the principle of reciprocity, that means no privileges are granted to a foreign official unless the United States embassy and consular personnel receive the equivalent privileges in that country. A state department spokesperson confirmed to The News that there were pending tax exemption issues related to the US diplomatic mission in Pakistan. However, the department said that both sides were in talks and hoped to resolve the issue and restore the tax privileges. Answering a question about the issue, Pakistan's embassy in Washington claimed that the issue of tax exemption and refunds is a routine topic of discussion between any two countries. ""There are thus ongoing discussions between Pakistan and the US on the status of exemption/refunds on the basis of the principle of reciprocity, which should not be construed as withdrawal of any privileges,"" the embassy said. There was so far no response from Pakistan's foreign ministry in Islamabad. Last year, the US placed ""reciprocal restrictions"" on the movement of Pakistani diplomats in the country from May 1, forcing them to stay within 40 kms of the city they are posted in. The US' move came after Pakistan imposed restrictions on American diplomats in the country and barred them from visiting the tribal belt and Karachi.

Brigadier Zahir Kazmi, director general Arms Control and Disarmament Affairs at Strategic Plans Division (SPD) told journalists that the stated purpose of deterrence was to close space for war and bring states to the negotiating table. ""Stability actually means peaceful resolution of territorial disputes in the subcontinent... nuclear deterrence should be a factor of stability between Pakistan and Hindustan,"" The Express Tribune quoted him as saying during a media interaction with senior Pakistani officials dealing with strategic affairs. Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated after the February 14 Pulwama attack by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) terror group which killed 40 CRPF personnel. Amid mounting outrage, the Indian Air Force carried out a counter-terror operation, hitting a JeM training camp in Balakot, deep inside Pakistan on February 26. The next day, Pakistan air force retaliated and downed a MiG-21 in an aerial combat and captured an Indian pilot, who was handed over to India on March 1. Brig Kazmi said deterrence worked during the post-Pulwama military stand-off despite India's attempt to escalate to a different level by talking about mobilisation of nuclear missile and nuclear submarines. He clarified that deterrence was not an end in itself but a psychological state. ""It should inspire fear in which the perceived cost of deterrence breakdown is higher than the desired benefits of preferring war as an instrument for dispute resolution,"" the report quoted him as saying. The director general Arms Control and Disarmament, ministry of foreign affairs, Muhammad Kamran Akhtar said that Pakistan demonstrated a more responsible and restrained behaviour during the standoff that led to de-escalation. He claimed that Pakistan was a responsible and restrained nuclear power and the country's safety and security record was immaculate and an example for many countries. At the media interaction organised by Islamabad Policy Institute, Akhtar dismissed the allegations that Pakistan possessed the fastest growing nuclear programme in the world. Defense analyst Syed Muhammad Ali said Pakistan's nuclear programme had significantly contributed towards meeting both its traditional and non-traditional security needs. Nuclear deterrence, he added, had enabled Pakistan timely manage and de-escalate several regional crises with India during the past three decades. This, he said, also gave Pakistan's leadership and diplomats more confidence in international diplomacy Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."|"N-deterrence helped de-escalate tensions during Pulwama crisis: Pak official"|"Fri May 31 21:57:00 CEST 2019"|"[world]"

In a statement issued here late Thursday, the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) of Punjab police said it arrested the three members during a raid on their hideout in Faisalabad, some 150 kilometres from Lahore. ""Millions of rupees have been recovered from their possession which they had collected for terror financing,"" it said. The CTD also said a report had been submitted to the Anti-Terrorism Court in Faisalabad against them. Last week, the Pakistani authorities arrested over 10 members of the Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terror group in Punjab on similar charges. A nation-wide crackdown against terror financing has been underway, police said. The Pakistan government has launched a crackdown against the outlawed organisations under the National Action Plan 2015 to eliminate militancy and extremism from the country's soil. The Imran Khan-led government has also announced the freezing of accounts and seizure of assets linked to organisations banned by the UN Security Council. Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) chief Saeed has been keeping a low profile after Prime Minister Imran Khan-led government took control of the JuD and its wing Falahai Insaniat Foundation's (FIF) properties, including seminaries and mosques, across the country. On February 21, the Pakistan government announced it had banned the JuD and FIF, amid intense global pressure to rein in the militant groups following the February 14 Pulwama terror attack that killed 40 CRPF jawans. Saeed has been barred from entering the JuD headquarters in Lahore and is reportedly spending most of his time at his Jauhar Town Lahore residence. Saeed's brother-in-law Hafiz Abdur Rehman Makki was also arrested this month on charges of making for hate speech and criticising the Pakistan government's action against 'terror' financing. He is detained at camp jail Lahore for 90 days under a public security order. According to officials, JuD's network includes 300 seminaries and schools, hospitals, a publishing house and ambulance service. The two groups have about 50,000 volunteers and hundreds of other paid workers. The JuD is believed to be the front organisation for the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) which is responsible for carrying out the Mumbai attack that killed 166 people. It had been declared as a foreign terrorist organisation by the US in June 2014. The US Department of the Treasury has designated its chief Saeed as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist, and the US, since 2012, has offered a $10 million reward for information that brings Saeed to justice. Saeed was listed under UN Security Council Resolution 1267 in December 2008. He was released from house arrest in Pakistan in November 2017.

He said his broader message to the Shangri-La Dialogue security conference will emphasize what the US has done to expand its commitment to the Indo-Pacific region, against the backdrop of China's growing influence and massive military buildup. Speaking to reporters just before he stepped into a meeting Friday with Chinese Defence Minister Wei Fenghe, Shanahan said he wants to foster a better military relationship with Beijing, but can't ignore the communist giant's military development on the manmade outposts. ""They argue that it's defensive, it looks like it's a bit overkill,"" said Shanahan. ""Surface-to-air missiles, long runways, I mean, seems excessive."" His remarks underscore America's frayed relations with China, as the Trump administration wages a trade war with Beijing, imposes sanctions on Chinese tech giant Huawei and approves a weapons sale to Taiwan, the self-ruled island the Communist mainland claims as its own territory. And they reflect America's new national defense strategy that declared great power competition with China and Russia as the nation's top priorities. Shanahan's speech on Saturday — his first major address on the international stage — will set the tone for US military cooperation and influence in the Indo-Pacific. And listening closely will be nervous allies and partners in the region who are worried about the economic impact of the US-China trade dispute and the political blowback of America's complaints about Beijing's rapid progress in hypersonic weapons, nuclear technology and space launches. He also will likely face fierce questions from Chinese leaders in the audience, as many US defence chiefs have seen during this annual forum. On Friday, Chinese defense ministry spokesman Wu Qian was both conciliatory and challenging. Speaking to reporters after Wei's meeting with Shanahan, Wu noted that the US has recently ""had a series of negative words and deeds"" on Taiwan issues. ""On the issue of safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity, the US should not underestimate the determination of the Chinese military, will or ability,"" he said. But he also said Shanahan and Wei found room for agreement on the need for denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and efforts to improve communication between the US and China. In a statement after the meeting, Army Lt. Col. Joe Buccino, a spokesman for Shanahan, said the 20-minute session was ""constructive and productive."" He said the two men discussed ""ways to build military-to-military relations that reduce the risk of misunderstanding and miscalculation between our nations."" For years, American defence secretaries have used the Shangri-La conference's podium to condemn China for its militarisation of outposts in contested areas of the South China Sea and for conducting cyber espionage against US technology programs. But they have balanced their criticism with calls for cooperation, stability and a rules-based order in the region. Shanahan told reporters Friday that the US needs to do a better job describing its level of commitment to the region, including military exercises, training and other activities. ""I do think we have to up our game on talking about interactions,"" he said, adding that the US will have a larger presence in the region for various military exercises. ""Our responsibility is to show them what we're actually doing.""

The initiative, driven by Jared Kushner, Donald Trump's son-in-law and White House adviser, was billed by the US president as the ""deal of the century"". While its precise outlines have yet to be revealed, Palestinian and Arab sources who have been briefed on the draft plan say Kushner has jettisoned the two-state solution - the long-standing US and international formula that envisages an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza. After several postponements, Washington plans a first formal outing of the economic components of the plan at a ""Peace for Prosperity"" workshop in June in Bahrain. The plan faces possible delays due to political upheaval in Israel, where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu must fight another election after failing to form a government. Kushner and Trump, with backgrounds in real estate rather than diplomacy, seem to be approaching this hitherto insoluble conflict as a transaction, three Arab officials briefed on the plan said. If the politics keep failing, the reasoning seems to be, then try dangling tens of billions of dollars before the Palestinians and Israel's Arab neighbours – and do a deal that could unlock prosperity for the Palestinians and security for Israel, these officials said. Politically, the deal envisages an expansion of Gaza into part of northern Egypt, under Egyptian control, Palestinian officials briefed on the plan told Reuters. Palestinians would be left with a smaller share of the West Bank and some areas on the outskirts of Jerusalem and no control over their borders. Western and Arab sources confirmed the outline of the plan. Jason Greenblatt, Trump's Middle East envoy, said ""rumours"" about an expansion into Egypt's Sinai desert were false. He declined to give details of the political plan before it is released. On the decision not to use the the term ""two-state solution"", Grenblatt said: ""We believe that using certain phrases and labels is not helpful because they lack detail and nuance – they mean different things to different people. The detailed plan, once released, will show what we think may be best solution for the two parties."" Not Buying It The Palestinians are not buying it. ""What we're seeing from the plan is that it will blow up the Palestinians,"" one Arab official told Reuters. ""The plan doesn't give justice to the Palestinians."" ""The Palestinian cause is being liquidated - no Jerusalem (as capital), no right of return for refugees, no sovereign state. That is why this American project is dangerous,"" one senior Palestinian leader told Reuters. The deal as outlined so far has been dismissed by President Mahmoud Abbas' western-backed Palestinian Authority in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Abbas has boycotted political dealings with the Trump administration for 18 months. This followed Trump's decisions in 2017 to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital and move the U.S. embassy there from Tel Aviv. Since then, the Trump administration has curtailed aid to the Palestinian Authority, shuttered the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) delegation in Washington and cut off finance to UNRWA, the U.N. agency supporting Palestinian refugees. Washington meanwhile endorsed Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights. ""In practice they have already started implementing 'the deal of the century',"" the senior Palestinian leader said, ""on the ground, step by step"". ""Today, the two-state solution has been scuttled"". Abbas is not alone in his view of the U.S. deal. It was rejected by the Islamist Hamas movement, which does not recognise Israel's right to exist and has only given conditional consent to a state in the occupied Palestinian territories. The PLO has dismissed the Kushner effort as an attempt to bribe Palestinians into accepting Israeli occupation of the West Bank, a prelude to Israel annexing about half their territory and leaving them with scattered cantons. Hanan Ashrawi, a moderate Palestinian leader, tweeted that the Kushner plan and the Bahrain conference were just ""a handout to make our captivity palatable"". Palestinian businessmen have opposed the Bahrain gathering despite a plea by Washington to attend, saying their political demands must be addressed in any peace plan. Qatar said economic prosperity cannot be achieved without political solutions acceptable to Palestinians. Oman said anything that precludes the establishment of a Palestinian state will not be acceptable. ""We are not proposing an economic peace,"" Greenblatt said. ""We know that is not acceptable to the Palestinians. We've been very clear that the full plan includes a political component as well. But the economic plan is an essential component to the full plan."" Moving On? Robert Satloff, executive director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, an influential think-tank and supporter of Israel, wrote after interviewing Kushner this month that the deal is a political disaster that should be abandoned. He said positive economic proposals could be lost by the attempt to skirt around Palestinian rights. ""The only way to protect the long-term viability of the plan's best aspects is to kill it,"" he said. Satloff wrote that ""unlike a real estate transaction in which one party gets the property and the other party gets the cash, a Middle East peace deal starts and ends with the two parties as neighbours, stuck with each other sharing a duplex for eternity"". Kushner meanwhile visited the Middle East this week seeking support for the June 25-26 Bahrain conference. The meeting is to talk about the cash. The U.S. plan expects almost all of this – $50 billion to $70 billion – to be put up by Gulf Arab allies, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, Palestinian sources said. Yet even that is now moot. Saudi Arabia, under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and the UAE, under Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, want to move on from a Palestinian conflict they believe has held back the Arab world. That means uniting with Israel against Iran and concentrating on domestic challenges such as economic reforms and confronting Islamist radicals. The Saudi crown prince maintains close ties with Kushner. But his father, King Salman, has twice said there will be no deal unless Israel meets Palestinian rights to a state. ""Kushner has been taken by surprise in his meetings in Riyadh recently, where there has definitely been a change in tone – in private and in public – by the Saudis,"" said a senior western diplomat. Asked for comment, the White House referred to its earlier official statement on Kusher's February meeting with the crown prince and the king which said they discussed ""increasing cooperation"" and efforts to facilitate peace between Israelis and Palestinians. New Reality The Palestinian official said it is clear that Israel ""is creating a new reality on the ground"" with the Trump administration's help – not least by paving the way for the annexation of Jewish settlements in the West Bank. The Palestinian and Arab officials briefed on the Kushner- Trump plan said its political contours, as explained to them, look like non-starters unless there is a peace deal. The essential part is Gaza: where 2 million Palestinians are shut into a strip between Israel and Egypt. The idea is to expand it into the north of Egypt's Sinai peninsula, creating an area where Palestinians can live and work under Egyptian control. ""The plan envisions Gaza stretching from Rafah (its southern border) to El Arish and some parts of Sinai. This area will be a Palestinian expansion in which Palestinians can reside,"" the Palestinian leader said. Big projects, such as an airport, a seaport, an industrial zone and power stations are envisaged, Palestinian sources briefed on the plan said. On the West Bank, the plan is for Israel to annex and join up the settlements, take the Jordan valley and make it the Israeli border with Jordan, and leave the Palestinians a bit less than half as ""an autonomous mini-state under some form of self-government"", the senior Palestinian leader said. As for Jerusalem, Palestinians would get neighbourhoods on the outskirts such as Abu Dis and Beit Hanina and Silwan: ""not the real Jerusalem (but) they will tell them this is your Jerusalem"", the Palestinian leader added. Western diplomats and intelligence sources worry about how the plan might affect Egypt and Jordan. However much money is offered, these sources question whether Egyptians would happily relinquish territory. And Jordan fears a Trump-backed Israel is returning to an old theme: Jordan is Palestine and that is where the Palestinians of the West Bank should go, they say.

A day after Trump's threat to impose a 5 per cent tariff — that could increase incrementally to 25 per cent — on all Mexican imports, Lopez Obrador seemed convinced that Trump just needed to be informed of all that Mexico has been doing to slow illegal migration, and he dispatched foreign affairs secretary Marcelo Ebrard to Washington on Friday. ""We are carrying out our responsibility in immigration policy,"" Lopez Obrador said at his daily morning news conference. He made no promises of new action to stem the flow of mostly Central American immigrants transiting Mexico to reach the US border. Mexico has stepped up raids on migrant caravans travelling through the southern states of Chiapas and Oaxaca this year. It has deported thousands of migrants and frustrated thousands more who wait endlessly for permits that would allow them to travel legally through Mexico. ""We have to help so that they don't enter the United States illegally, but we also have to do it respecting human rights,"" Lopez Obrador said. ""Nothing authoritarian. They're human beings."" Since taking office December 1, Lopez Obrador has espoused a longer term immigration fix focused on raising living standards and increasing opportunities so that those who he says are forced to migrate no longer have to. On Friday, he also noted that most of the immigration flow is not Mexican, but rather citizens of Central America's Northern Triangle countries, Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. He referred to those countries' ""crises"" of unemployment and violence as being the main drivers of illegal immigration. Lopez Obrador has lobbied the US government and other countries to support a Marshall Plan-like development agreement focused on development in southern Mexico and the Northern Triangle. But his medium- and long-term immigration solutions are colliding with the potential short-term benefits for Trump of rallying his base during an election cycle with incendiary threats. On Friday, Trump resumed his Twitter complaints, writing: ""Mexico has taken advantage of the United States for decades. Because of the Dems, our Immigration Laws are BAD. Mexico makes a FORTUNE from the US, have for decades, they can easily fix this problem. Time for them to finally do what must be done."" Mexico has taken advantage of the United States for decades.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 1559309429000 Mexico can continue to make it more difficult for migrants to cross the country to the US border, though the smugglers who have plied those routes for decades would benefit from a crackdown. But sealing Mexico's southern border with Guatemala is likely impossible. It doesn't have the infrastructure to adequately patrol a border that includes a river passing through jungle. Lopez Obrador has said before that Mexico can expect to take some hits from the Trump administration as the US elections near. On Thursday, Trump tweeted: ""On June 10th, the United States will impose a 5 per cent Tariff on all goods coming into our Country from Mexico, until such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico, and into our Country, STOP. The Tariff will gradually increase until the Illegal Immigration problem is remedied."" The economic impact for Mexico was swift. The peso dropped more than 3 per cent against the US dollar by Friday morning. Mexico's Banco Base warned that the announced tariffs pose a grave threat for Mexico's economic growth outlook since 80 per cent of its exports go to the United States. It estimated that the 5 per cent tariff could knock 2.85 percentage points off the growth of Mexico's exports, but that the weaker peso would help compensate. Trump's threat came the same day that Mexico's government announced it would begin the ratification process of the new agreement with the United States and Canada to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement and less than two weeks after Mexico successfully negotiated the lifting of steel and aluminum tariffs from the US that had been a roadblock to ratifying the new trade deal. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement was one of the Trump administration's most touted achievements, but is now once again in jeopardy. Lopez Obrador said that since Thursday night, he had been receiving messages of support from all sectors of Mexican society and felt great solidarity. Asked by a reporter why Mexico would not just skip the dialogue and file a complaint with an international trade body, Lopez Obrador said it was not just a legal question.

Exhausted and angry, passengers became irate on Wednesday night at Heathrow airport staff when there was no aircraft to board, which led to armed police being drafted in to maintain order. The 293 passengers were originally meant to have boarded Flight AI 130 at 1.15 pm local time on Tuesday. At first they were told there was a one-and-a-half-hour delay, but it ended up being a 48-hour delay. The passengers, including young children and the elderly in wheelchairs, were finally put on the repaired plane on Thursday at 2 pm local time, having spent two nights in different Heathrow airport hotels. Debashis Golder, AI regional manager for UK and Europe, said three engineers arrived in London from Mumbai with parts from the aeroplane engine manufacturer, GE, on May 29 to repair the “fuel leak”, but could not repair the aircraft before 9 pm so take-off was delayed to May 30. He said the aircraft “finally departed on Thursday at 2.09 pm with 288 passengers on board as that was the only slot air traffic control could provide”. Some passengers had taken alternate flights. The 1.15 pm AI London to Mumbai flight on May 29 was also delayed — by eight hours — and those passengers were sent to the same hotel room as the May 28 passengers, meaning all day Wednesday 600 AI passengers were stranded at Heathrow. The May 29 flight eventually took off at 9.30 pm Wednesday. A video shared with TOI shows passengers from the 28 May flight shouting at a lone member of staff from Heathrow and a group of armed officers arriving airside on Wednesday night. A Met Police spokeswoman told TOI that officers were sent to the scene “as a precautionary measure and to prevent any breach of the peace”. The passengers had been sent back to the airport on Wednesday and told their flight was departing at 10pm, but despite having checked in and gone airside there was no gate or aeroplane to board. Heather Gupta, 49, a British HR director who was booked on the 28 May flight with her two children, said: “There was just one Air India woman who spoke to us and she was clueless and did not know anything, and then she disappeared. Passengers were going crazy. They were irate. It was mental and no one had any idea what was going on. The police came around 10.30 pm and said we had to leave and they took us back through immigration and put us up in a different hotel. But we never got our luggage back as that was checked in so none of us had any clothes. I just hope it is on this flight,” she said, speaking to TOI from the aircraft on Thursday before it took off. “We have not been offered any compensation,” she added. Gupta had shelled out Rs 2.5 lakh for three return tickets with Jet Airways. Those flights were cancelled and she received no refund for them. She then spent a further Rs 2.85 lakh on three Air India tickets. Several passengers joined a WhatsApp group set up by Instalocate that claims it can get them compensation of euro 600 per flight per passenger under EU laws, but Gupta said it charged a 25% commission.

The diplomatic tax exemption programme - usually granted to foreign diplomats and consulars - provides sales and use, occupancy, food, airline, gas, and utility tax exemptions to eligible foreign officials on assignment in the Unites States. The facility is enjoyed by the officials' dependents too. The decision to take back the special tax exemption cards issued to the Pakistani officials was made on May 15, after which the affected staffers had to surrender the privilege, The News International reported from Washington. The number of affected staffers of the Pakistani embassy are a little over 20, the report said. Tax exemption privileges for foreign diplomats, consular officers and staff members are generally based on two international treaties: The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. Since all such services and privileges are based on the principle of reciprocity, that means no privileges are granted to a foreign official unless the United States embassy and consular personnel receive the equivalent privileges in that country. A state department spokesperson confirmed to The News that there were pending tax exemption issues related to the US diplomatic mission in Pakistan. However, the department said that both sides were in talks and hoped to resolve the issue and restore the tax privileges. Answering a question about the issue, Pakistan's embassy in Washington claimed that the issue of tax exemption and refunds is a routine topic of discussion between any two countries. ""There are thus ongoing discussions between Pakistan and the US on the status of exemption/refunds on the basis of the principle of reciprocity, which should not be construed as withdrawal of any privileges,"" the embassy said. There was so far no response from Pakistan's foreign ministry in Islamabad. Last year, the US placed ""reciprocal restrictions"" on the movement of Pakistani diplomats in the country from May 1, forcing them to stay within 40 kms of the city they are posted in. The US' move came after Pakistan imposed restrictions on American diplomats in the country and barred them from visiting the tribal belt and Karachi.

In a confidential quarterly report distributed to member states and seen by The Associated Press, the International Atomic Energy Agency said Iran has stayed within key limitations set in the so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA. The deal is meant to keep Tehran from building atomic weapons in exchange for economic incentives. It has been complicated by the unilateral withdrawal of the United States last year and Washington's increased sanctions, which has been taking a toll on the Iranian economy. That has left the other signatories - Germany, Britain, France, Russia and China - struggling to come up with enough incentives to keep Iran in the deal. Earlier this month, Iran announced that if a way couldn't be found within 60 days to shield it from US sanctions targeting its economy and oil industry, it would increase its enrichment of uranium beyond the purity allowed under the JCPOA. And about a week ago, Iran said it had increased its uranium-enrichment production capacity, though only of the lower-enriched uranium permitted by the agreement. In its first quarterly report since those announcements, however, the Vienna-based IAEA found Iran continued to be in compliance with the JCPOA and also said its inspectors had been given unfettered access to Iranian nuclear facilities. ""Timely and proactive cooperation by Iran in providing such access facilitates implementation of the additional protocol and enhances confidence,'' the report stated, referring to the procedure detailing safeguards and tools for verification. The IAEA said Iran's heavy water stockpile was 125.2 metric tons (138 U.S. tons) as of May 26, up from 124.8 tons in February but below the 130 ton limit. Its stock of low-enriched uranium was 174.1 kilograms (383.8 pounds) as of May 20, up from 163.8 kilograms in February; the limit is 202.8 kilograms. It added that Iran had not enriched any uranium above the level allowed by the JCPOA. ""All centrifuges and associated infrastructure in storage have remained under continuous agency monitoring,'' the IAEA said.

""Had I known about a possible attack, I would have taken necessary steps to prevent it,"" Sirisena said during a media interaction.

He said his broader message to the Shangri-La Dialogue security conference will emphasize what the US has done to expand its commitment to the Indo-Pacific region, against the backdrop of China's growing influence and massive military buildup. Speaking to reporters just before he stepped into a meeting Friday with Chinese Defence Minister Wei Fenghe, Shanahan said he wants to foster a better military relationship with Beijing, but can't ignore the communist giant's military development on the manmade outposts. ""They argue that it's defensive, it looks like it's a bit overkill,"" said Shanahan. ""Surface-to-air missiles, long runways, I mean, seems excessive."" His remarks underscore America's frayed relations with China, as the Trump administration wages a trade war with Beijing, imposes sanctions on Chinese tech giant Huawei and approves a weapons sale to Taiwan, the self-ruled island the Communist mainland claims as its own territory. And they reflect America's new national defense strategy that declared great power competition with China and Russia as the nation's top priorities. Shanahan's speech on Saturday — his first major address on the international stage — will set the tone for US military cooperation and influence in the Indo-Pacific. And listening closely will be nervous allies and partners in the region who are worried about the economic impact of the US-China trade dispute and the political blowback of America's complaints about Beijing's rapid progress in hypersonic weapons, nuclear technology and space launches. He also will likely face fierce questions from Chinese leaders in the audience, as many US defence chiefs have seen during this annual forum. On Friday, Chinese defense ministry spokesman Wu Qian was both conciliatory and challenging. Speaking to reporters after Wei's meeting with Shanahan, Wu noted that the US has recently ""had a series of negative words and deeds"" on Taiwan issues. ""On the issue of safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity, the US should not underestimate the determination of the Chinese military, will or ability,"" he said. But he also said Shanahan and Wei found room for agreement on the need for denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and efforts to improve communication between the US and China. In a statement after the meeting, Army Lt. Col. Joe Buccino, a spokesman for Shanahan, said the 20-minute session was ""constructive and productive."" He said the two men discussed ""ways to build military-to-military relations that reduce the risk of misunderstanding and miscalculation between our nations."" For years, American defence secretaries have used the Shangri-La conference's podium to condemn China for its militarisation of outposts in contested areas of the South China Sea and for conducting cyber espionage against US technology programs. But they have balanced their criticism with calls for cooperation, stability and a rules-based order in the region. Shanahan told reporters Friday that the US needs to do a better job describing its level of commitment to the region, including military exercises, training and other activities. ""I do think we have to up our game on talking about interactions,"" he said, adding that the US will have a larger presence in the region for various military exercises.

He was here to attend Prime Minister Narendra Modi's swearing-in ceremony. ""I believe both Saarc and BIMSTEC are regionally significant organisation.

But after the terrorist attack on an Indian Army camp in Uri in Jammu and Kashmir on September 18 that year, India expressed its inability to participate in the summit. The summit was called off after Bangladesh, Bhutan and Afghanistan also declined to participate. Maldives and Sri Lanka are the seventh and eighth members of the initiative. In the past few years, India has been pushing for regional cooperation under the BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation) umbrella.

In 2014, Modi had invited all Saarc leaders, including the then Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif for his swearing-in ceremony, in a major initiative to reach out to the neighbourhood.

A parliamentary select committee was appointed to probe the events leading to the April 21 attacks and any lapses by those responsible following reports that India had alerted the Sri Lankan defence establishment on the impending attacks. Testifying before the committee on Wednesday, Sisira Mendis, a retired senior police official who is now the chief of national intelligence, said that at an intelligence coordination meeting on April 9 discussed the information received on the impending attacks. He claimed he had written to the Inspector General of Police despite the meeting ignoring the information. ""It (the prior information on the attacks) was never a main point for discussion,"" Mendis told the committee. ""On behalf of the secretary to the ministry of defence, I sent a letter to the Inspector General of Police on this threat. I marked the letter as ""eyes only"" which is to indicate its importance,"" he said, adding the letter was dated April 9. In a statement issued on Thursday, mentioning a different date, Sirisena said at the over two-hour-long intelligence coordination meeting on April 8 ""no official ever gave any information on such a terrorist attack"". More than 250 people were killed in the coordinated suicide bomb attacks carried out by the local Jihadi group National Thowheed Jammath (NTJ) linked to the ISIS. Mendis told the committee that the defence establishment was focusing on possible ISIS links in the country since 2016. Police chief Pujith Jayasundera was sent on compulsory leave by Sirisena for alleged responsibility to the failure to prevent the attack. Jayasundera on Wednesday filed a fundamental rights petition in the Supreme Court against his ""unfair sacking"". The parliamentary probe was boycotted by Sirisena's Freedom Party members and parliamentarians of the leader of the opposition Mahinda Rajapaksa. The ruling coalition's dominant partner United National Party of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the JVP, the Marxist opposition party, are taking part in the probe. Wickremesinghe despite taking responsibility to the government's inability to prevent the attacks claimed that he had been excluded from the National Security Council (NSC) meetings since October last year.

The report released by the US Department of Treasury states the US blocked nearly $400,000 in funds of the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and $1,725 of the Jaish-e Mohammed. The Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is the leading US Government agency responsible for implementing sanctions against the assets of international terrorist organisations and terrorism-supporting countries. The federal body implements these sanctions as part of its general mission to administer and enforce economic and trade sanctions based on US foreign policy and national security goals. According to the report, till 2018, the US blocked more than $46.1 million in funds of designated terrorist groups and individuals, an increase of about $2.5 million than that of $43.6 million in 2017. The list includes the Haqqani network ($3,626), the Harkat ul-Mujahidin ($11,988) and the Hizbul Mujahideen ($2,287). For the Lashkar-I Jhangvi, the amount of funds blocked by the US dropped from $12,829 in 2017 to $10,962. The report states there was a significant jump in Taliban funds blocked by the United States, which increased from $10,728 in 2017 to $206,805 in 2018. However, for the Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan, the US had blocked a paltry $318 in 2018. The US continues to block more than $500,000 in funds of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, which has remained the same for the past two years. Notably the al-Qaeda tops the list of the blocked amount, In 2018, the US had blocked $6.4 million of the al Qaeda funds, which was nearly $900,000 less than the $7.3 million blocked in 2017.

In what seemed an improbable scenario just days ago, Israel's newly elected Knesset dissolved itself in an early morning 74-45 vote and set a new election date for September 17. The developments were a shocking setback for Netanyahu, who had appeared to secure a comfortable win in last month's election. But he was unable to build a parliamentary majority needed to rule because a traditional ally, Avigdor Lieberman, refused to bring his Yisrael Beiteinu faction into the coalition. Netanyahu, who has led Israel for the past decade, now faces another challenge to his lengthy rule. It comes as he prepares for a pre-indictment hearing before expected criminal charges against him in a series of corruption cases. Assuming they would sweep into power again, Netanyahu's allies in the ruling Likud Party had already begun drafting a contentious bill aimed at granting him immunity from the various corruption charges awaiting him. He was also looking to push legislation limiting the power of Israel's Supreme Court and paving his path to many more years in office. But it was a separate issue that sparked the unprecedented crisis, and for the first time in history thrust Israel into a repeat election before a new government was even formed. Lieberman - a veteran nationalist and secular politician - demanded that current legislation mandating that young ultra-Orthodox men be drafted into the military run its course. Years of exemptions for ultra-Orthodox men have generated widespread resentment among the rest of Jewish Israelis who serve. The ultra-Orthodox, backed by Netanyahu, refused to bend and the showdown quickly devolved into a full-blown crisis that imploded the perspective government. ""The public chose me, and Lieberman, unfortunately, deceived his voters. From the beginning he had no intention to do what he said,"" Netanyahu said after the vote, accusing Lieberman of aligning with ""the left."" Lieberman, a former top aide to Netanyahu who has alternated between a close alliance and bitter rivalry with his former boss, retorted that the new election was a result of Netanyahu caving into the ultra-Orthodox. ""This is a complete surrender of Likud to the ultra-Orthodox,"" he said. A new election complicates Netanyahu's efforts to pass the proposed bills to protect himself from prosecution. Even if Netanyahu wins the election, it is unlikely he will be able to form a government and lock down the required political support for an immunity deal before an expected indictment. That would force him to stand trial, and in turn put heavy pressure on him to step aside. No one in Likud has yet challenged him publicly. The political uncertainty could also spell trouble for the White House's Mideast peace efforts. The US has scheduled a conference next month in Bahrain to unveil what it says is the first phase of its peace plan, an initiative aimed at drawing investment into the Palestinian territories. The Trump administration had vowed to unveil its plan after the Israeli election and it's unclear how the current political shakeup will affect that rollout.

In yet another extraordinary but characteristic meltdown on Thursday, Trump raged against Mueller and his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S Presidential election in a pair of self-implicating tweets, after the special counsel torched him in a parting press statement as he bowed out of office and public limelight.

In a devastating blow to Trump just before he resigned from the Justice Department on the conclusion of the probe, Mueller repeated another conclusion even more assertively that ""If we had had confidence that President Trump clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so."" In a While House gaggle, Trump seized on the fact that Mueller had not charged him (although the Special Counsel indicated that was only because of the rules) to claim exoneration, while rolling back his previous admission of Russia’s role. ""No, Russia did not help me get elected. You know who got me elected? You know who got me elected? I got me elected,"" he said, jabbing a finger at himself. ""Russia didn't help me at all. Russia, if anything, I think, helped the other side."" ""Someday, you oughta read a thing called Article Two. Read Article Two, which gives the President powers you wouldn't believe,"" Trump advised reporters, adding, ""but I don't even have to rely on Article Two. There was no crime, there was no obstruction no obstruction, there was no collusion, there was no nothing."" Mueller’s ten-minute press statement on Wednesday were his first public remarks since concluding a nearly two-year investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether Trump sought to obstruct the probe. Trump gave him the ""don’t let the door hit you on the way out treatment"" after the Special Counsel refused to publicly exonerate the President - a claim Trump asserted several times - and instead implicated him while suggesting it was up to the Congress to take the next steps. ""Robert Mueller should have never been chosen…he was conflicted,"" Trump fumed, citing some undisclosed business disputes involving Mueller (who was once a member of a Trump Golf Club) and the fact that he may have been in consideration for FBI Director in the Trump administration.

The article with that headline published on its website on Tuesday, asked ""How has this supposedly divisive figure not only managed to keep power, but increase his levels of support?"" and answered: ""A key factor is that Modi has managed to transcend India's greatest fault line: the class divide"". The writer, Manoj Ladwa, credited Modi's emergence as a unifier to his origins in a backward caste -- a factor missed or deliberately omitted by Western media obsessed with what they call upper caste domination. ""Narendra Modi was born into one of India's most disadvantaged social groups,"" he explained. ""In reaching the very top, he personifies the aspirational working classes and can self-identify with his country's poorest citizens in a way that the Nehru-Gandhi political dynasty, who have led India for most of the 72 years since independence, simply cannot."" ""Yet despite the strong and often unfair criticisms levelled at Modi's policies both throughout his first term and this marathon election, no Prime Minister has united the Indian electorate as much in close to five decades,"" he said referring to Indira Gandhi's massive 1971 victory. The pre-election cover story by Aatish Taseer was turned into campaign fodder in India and acclaimed by Modi's critics as an indictment of him as a ""divider"" by a global media powerhouse. In reality, Time is an ailing magazine that has changed hands twice in a year -- bought in March last year by Meredith, the publisher of magazines like Better Homes and Gardens, and All Recipes, it was sold again in September to tech entrepreneur Marc Benioff, the founder of Salesforce, and his wife. In fact Time's flagship US edition did not bother run the Modi story as cover, and instead gave the spot to Elizabeth Warren, a candidate for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination for president. The Britain-born son of Indian journalist Tavleen Singh and the late Salmaan Taseer, the governor of Pakistan's Punjab province, Taseer wrote in the cover story, ""Not only has Modi's economic miracle failed to materialise, he has also helped create an atmosphere of poisonous religious nationalism in India."" However, in the latest story, Ladwa writes: ""Through socially progressive policies, he has brought many Indians, both Hindus and religious minorities, out of poverty at a faster rate than in any previous generation."" Ladwa is the founder and CEO of Britain-based media company India Inc., which publishes India Global Business. In Time's other post-election analysis, Alyssa Ayres, who was the deputy assistant secretary of state in former President Barack Obama's administration, hedged her bets on the economic course of his second term. She wrote: ""A bold economic reform agenda may be what comes next. But equally possible, based on the recent track record, might be stepped-up development projects in lieu of tough reforms, and a more nationalist approach to economic matters."" ""A mandate for improved quality of life might not imply a mandate for further opening markets. It's a distinction that matters, not least because expectations internationally might assume the latter,"" she added. Ayres, now a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, saw a bumpy road ahead for India-US economic relations with President Donald Trump's focus on trade deficits. ""The US-India economic dialogue, for decades fraught at the best of times, is in a tough place,"" she said, adding ""The longstanding list of trade complaints -- many of them US complaints about India's market -- contains a mind-numbing array of issues"".

In a dramatic finale to nearly three years of political turmoil arising from reports of Russian interference in the 2016 US Presidential elections, Mueller made a ten-minute long statement to clarify his conclusions without taking any questions from journalists, while announcing that he is also resigning from the Department of Justice and returning to private life. He also indicated he is not inclined to testify before Congress because whatever he had to say is contained in his report and there was nothing he could or would add to that. The gist of his statement: There was little doubt that Russia interfered in the US elections in various ways, from hacking the Clinton campaign servers to releasing information to damage a presidential candidate. But there was “insufficient evidence” to show that there was any collusion or collaboration from the Trump campaign on the issue. On the second matter relating to the obstruction of justice issue, Mueller indicated that the only reason he did not or could not indict President Trump was because he was rule-bound, and his parent Justice department, to which the Special Counsel’s office is attached, is constitution-bound. And the Constitution does not allow indictment of a president while he is in office. But in an implicit rejection of President Trump’s repeated assertion that he had been absolved of all charges, including collusion and obstruction, by the Mueller report, the Special Counsel stonily maintained: “If we had confidence that the president had not committed a crime we would have said so.” “The special counsel’s office is part of Department of Justice so we had to abide by rules,” Mueller said, adding, “It would be unfair to potentially accuse someone of a crime when there could be no resolution.” The statements suggested that Trump was essentially saved by a rule-bound investigators and officials adhering to the Justice Department’s interpretation of the Constitution even though the Mueller report explicitly said it does exonerate the President. Trump has repeatedly claimed the Mueller report exonerated him. Mueller will now go down in history as the man who indirectly implicated Trump but did not indict him citing constitutional constraints. Even the Democratic-controlled Congress may not be able to get more out of him. ""Any testimony from this office would not go beyond our report,"" Mueller said, adding, ""It contains our findings and analysis and the reasons for the decisions we said. We chose those words carefully and the work speaks for itself."" The matter will now go into the political domain and become a campaign issue in the run-up to the 2020 elections.

At least four people were killed and more than 50 injured when unidentified individuals believed to be security personnel opened fire on a crowd of protesters last Sunday. According to local journalists, the Pakistan army had tried to prevent the PTM leaders from reaching the area where they were supposed to give their speeches. When their supporters tried to remove the barriers, the army had opened fire on them. The eruption of violence was followed by arrests of PTM members and leaders. Gohar Wazir, a reporter with private Pashto-language satellite TV station Khyber News, was among the people arrested by security officials in Bannu, a district adjacent to North Waziristan, after reporting on PTM demonstrations. Just ahead of his arrest, he had interviewed Moshin Dawar, a prominent PTM leader who was elected to Pakistan’s National Assembly last year. Wazir and others were arrested under the Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance (MPO), a law that allows for preventive detention for up to six months. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has urged Pakistan to immediately release Gohar Wazir. “Gohar Wazir should not have to face arrest merely for doing the job of reporting the news, even reporting on controversial events such as protests by the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement,” said Steven Butler, CPJ Asia programme coordinator. “Restrictions on Pakistan’s media only serve to undermine the strength of Pakistan’s democracy,” he added. Before Wazir’s arrest, four journalists of Khyber News were gunned down in the past in the line of duty, two of them, Malik Mumtaz and Allah Noor Wazir, in North and South Waziristan tribal districts. Allah Noor had gone to cover a story regarding the peace agreement signed between Baitullah Mehsud, the slain former chief of the Pakistani Taliban, and the law enforcement agencies in South Waziristan in 2005, while Malik Mumtaz was shot dead in 2013 by unidentified men in a car with tinted windows as he was driving home in Miramshah, North Waziristan. Journalists working in the tribal districts said they were often threatened by militant groups, criminal gangs involved in drug trafficking and arms dealing, as well as the Pakistani military and intelligence agencies. “Despite a strict warning, allegedly from the country’s powerful security establishment, against coverage of news related to PTM or the war against terror in the Pashto-speaking belt, some Pashtun reporters, taking advantage of the language, endanger their lives by crossing the red lines,” said Hamid Shamshad, head of content of Khyber News, demanding the release of his reporter. Although the killing of journalists has declined in Pakistan in recent years, CPJ has documented a rising trend of censorship owing to pressure from the military.

Speaking to local media, Qureshi explained that BJP’s election campaign had focused entirely on Pakistan-bashing. “India’s internal politics did not permit the government to extend an invitation to Khan. It was unwise to expect that New Delhi could get rid of this narrative soon,” the FM said. He said relations between India and Pakistan were based on reciprocity and PM Khan had congratulated PM Modi as a goodwill gesture when his party had secured a landslide victory in the Lok Sabha polls. “The Indian PM had congratulated Imran Khan after he won the general election last year and wrote a letter as well,” Qureshi said. The minister said a meeting for the sake of dialogue to find a solution to the Kashmir, Siachen and Sir Creek disputes would be more significant than attending the swearing-in ceremony. “Finding a new way to resume dialogue is essential if PM Modi wants development of this region. The only way is to sit with Pakistan and find solutions to the problems through consultations,” Qureshi said. According to diplomatic sources, Modi and Khan could still meet at a Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Kyrgyzstan next month. An Indian government statement on Monday said the leaders of Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Bhutan — all members of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (Bimstec) alongside India — have been invited to Modi’s swearing-in.

Over the years, the demand among nearly half a million Sikh population in UK to have a separate Sikh ethnic tick box in the 2021 census has gained strength even as the UK government has allocated tick box to minuscule communities of Roma ethnicity, Gypsy or Irish Traveller. UK based Sikh body Sikh Federation (SF) that claims to have support of over 120 Gurdwara's and Sikh organization is of view that it will be unlawful for the cabinet office to lay before Parliament a census order based on the proposals set out by the office of national statistics (ONS) in their December 2018 White Paper. The draft Census Order is due to be laid before Parliament in autumn 2019. Chair of SF Amrik Singh informed on Wednesday that the federation believed that the process which preceded the ONS' recommendation that a Sikh ethnicity category not be included in the 2021 census was unlawful. ""The ONS wrongly relied on results from a report from an external company whose analysis was based on a definition of the ""public acceptability"" criteria that was different from that previously published and which the ONS has promised to use when determining whether to include a tick box or not"". Sikh's demand to include a Sikh ethnic tick box in the ethnicity section is not new in UK.

He said ""without public bodies monitoring Sikhs as a distinct ethnic group they cannot be aware of the barriers Sikhs face as a religio-ethnic community. As a result decisions are taken by local authorities and central government, on the basis of inaccurate data, that overlook the specific needs of this community.

On Monday, the US tied its current record of 11 consecutive days with at least eight tornadoes confirmed on each of those days, said Patrick Marsh, warning coordination meteorologist for the federal Storm Prediction Center. The previous 11-day stretch of at least eight tornadoes per day ended on June 7, 1980. ""We're getting big counts on a lot of these days and that is certainly unusual,'' Marsh said. The National Weather Service had already received at least 27 more reports of tornadoes Tuesday, suggesting that the record for consecutive days would be broken once the official totals are in. The weather service has received 934 tornado reports so far this year, up from the yearly average of 743 observed tornadoes. More than 500 of those reports came in the last 30 days. The actual number is likely lower, however, because some of the reports probably come from different witnesses who spot the same twister. The US has experienced a lull in the number of tornadoes since 2012, with tornado counts tracking at or below average each year and meteorologists still working to figure out why. ""A lot of people are trying to answer that, but there's no definitive answer,'' Marsh said. The recent surge in tornado activity over the past two weeks was driven by high pressure over the Southeast and an unusually cold trough over the Rockies that forced warm, moist air into the central US, sparking repeated severe thunderstorms and periodic tornadoes. ""Neither one of these large systems the high over the Southeast or the trough over the Rockies are showing signs of moving,'' Marsh said. ""It's a little unusual for them to be so entrenched this late in the season.'' Those conditions are ripe for the kind of tornadoes that have swept across the Midwest in the last two weeks, said Cathy Zapotocny, a meteorologist for the weather service in Valley, Nebraska. Zapotocny said the unstable atmosphere helped fuel many of the severe winter storms and subsequent flooding that ravaged Nebraska, Iowa and Missouri earlier this year. ""We've been stuck in this pattern since February,'' she said. Zapotocny said the number of tornadoes this year was ""basically normal'' until the surge this week. May is typically the month with the highest incidence of tornadoes, usually in the Plains and Midwestern states collectively known as Tornado Alley, where most of this year's twisters have hit. Most of the confirmed tornadoes were rated as less-intense EF0, EF1 and EF2s on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. But 23 were classified as EF3 tornadoes, with wind speeds of 136-165 mph. The strongest confirmed tornado this year was the EF4 tornado that killed 23 people in Alabama in March. So far this year, 38 people have died in 10 tornadoes in the United States, including a combined seven within the last week in Iowa, Missouri, Oklahoma and Ohio. The relative quiet in recent years followed the massive tornado that killed 161 people and injured more than 1,100 in Joplin, Missouri, in 2011. The EF5 storm packed winds in excess of 200 mph and was on the ground for more than 22 miles. Scientists also say climate change is responsible for more intense and more frequent extreme weather such as storms, droughts, floods and fires, but without extensive study they cannot directly link a single weather event to the changing climate. Monday's outbreak was unusual because it occurred over a particularly wide geographic area. Eight states were affected by two regional outbreaks, in the high Plains and the Ohio River Valley. Tornadoes strafed the Kansas City metropolitan area straddling Kansas and Missouri Tuesday night, barely a week after a massive tornado ripped through the Missouri state capital of Jefferson City.

Lewis Bennett, 42, apologized to the family of Isabella Hellman during a Tuesday hearing before U.S. District Judge Federico Moreno in Miami. He waived his right to appeal. Defense attorneys sought a 7-year sentence, a year lower than the maximum number spelled out in a plea agreement reached last November. Bennett was originally charged with murder, with investigators alleging he intentionally tried to sink the boat, but later dropped the charges. ``It's not because I expect that he will commit this crime again,'' Judge Moreno said. ``Sentencing is for punishment.'' Before Moreno announced his decision, Bennett, a dual citizen of Australia and the United Kingdom, asked the judge that he let him get out of prison sooner so he could continue to raise the couple's daughter, who was an infant when the mother vanished. Emelia Bennett turns 3 in July and is being raised by his parents in Scotland. ``If you may permit me to be with my daughter as soon as possible,'' Bennett said. ``I want to bring her up in a manner that is respectful to my wife's wishes.'' But Moreno sided with prosecutors and chose eight years in prison as the sentence and three years on supervised release. Hellman disappeared as the couple sailed off the Bahamas in May 2017. A statement from the U.S. Attorney's office says Bennett had experience sailing, including training on emergency procedures and had previously traveled from St. Marteen to Australia. His wife, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Cuba, had not trained in emergency sailing procedures and had less experience, prosecutors said. The couple had been married for three months when they set sail to St. Marteen, Puerto Rico and Cuba for a delayed honeymoon in late April. After they left Cuba on May 14, Bennett asked Hellman take over control of the boat for the night so he could go rest in the boat's cabin, according to court documents. He didn't require her to wear a life jacket, harness or personal locator, prosecutors said in the statement. He said he woke up when the craft hit something, and Hellman was missing. Assistant U.S. attorney Kurt Lunkenheimer said on Tuesday that Bennett ``did not search for her diligently enough despite him being an experienced sailor.'' The government maintained he didn't use the satellite phone to call for help. Instead, he loaded provisions and stolen silver coins onto a life raft and boarded it. Prosecutors said he called for help 45 minutes after he had woken up realizing his wife was gone. A U.S. Coast Guard helicopter rescued him and flew him to the Florida Keys. Authorities searched for Hellman for four days, but never found her body. A Florida state judge declared Hellman dead earlier this month to clear the way for the couple's daughter to inherit her mother's estate. ``Hellman's death occurred as a result of Bennett's knowledge of circumstances that existed that could have reasonably enabled him to foresee threat to life,'' said the U.S. Attorney's office statement Tuesday. The FBI said an inspection found that holes in the hull were inflicted from the inside and hatches were opened in a deliberate attempt to sink the boat. Bennett was initially arrested and charged with murder last year before reaching a plea deal with federal prosecutors. He had already pleaded guilty to transporting $100,000 in stolen coins. The defense attorney declined to comment. An attorney for Hellman's family said her relatives were satisfied with the judge's decisions and were excited they would soon be able to visit Emelia in Scotland. ``There is nothing that can or could be done to bring Isabella back,'' said Mitchell Kitroser, a lawyer who spoke on behalf of the Hellman's family and said they were planning a visit in June. Emelia ``lost her mom but that doesn't mean that she has lost her mom's family.''

The federation, which says it has the backing of more than 120 gurdwaras and Sikh organisations, wants a Sikh option to be included in the response to the question “What is your ethnic group?” in the 2021 census, due to be conducted online in March of that year. They argue capturing this data will help counter discrimination against British Sikhs since the census is used by public authorities to plan for public services, health care, homes and schools. The federation sent a “letter before action” to the Cabinet Office last week in which it argued that “any attempt to understand data on ethnic Sikhs using religious data would yield inaccurate results”. If no satisfactory response is received to that letter, the group said it would “consider initiating judicial review proceedings”. David Wolfe QC and Ayesha Christie of Matrix Chambers have already been instructed. Rosa Curling, solicitor from law firm Leigh Day, representing the federation, said: “Our clients believe it is crucial that individuals are able to identify as ethnically Sikh in the next census to ensure a more accurate picture of the community is taken. This will ensure public bodies are fulfilling their duties under the Equality Act when making decisions about the allocation of vital public services.” Currently the options in the proposed ethnicity box include White, Mixed/Multiple Ethnic Groups, Asian/Asian British, Black/African/Caribbean/Black British and Other Ethnic Group. Within the Asian/Asian British section you can tick “Indian”, “Pakistani”, “Bangladeshi”, “Chinese” or “any other Asian background…”, but there is no box explicitly stating “Sikh”. In the last census in 2011, 83,362 people refused to select one of the available ethnic boxes and instead handwrote “Sikh”. There is also the voluntary question “What is your religion?” to which “Sikh” is listed as a response option alongside other religions. In 2011, the census recorded approximately 430,000 Sikhs based on the religion question. The federation said its own estimate is that there are approximately 700,000-800,000 ethnic Sikhs in the UK. Bhai Amrik Singh, chair of the SFUK, said: “Without public bodies monitoring Sikhs as a distinct ethnic group they cannot be aware of the barriers Sikhs face as a religio-ethnic community. As a result decisions are taken by local authorities and central government, on the basis of inaccurate data, that overlook the specific needs of this community.” In its white paper published in December 2018, the Cabinet Office wrote: “The Office of National Statistics does not propose adding an additional specific response option to the 2021 Census ethnic group question because of the evidence that this would not be acceptable to a proportion of the Sikh population.” But the federation said it believes that the process which preceded this white paper was “unlawful”. However, not all Sikhs are in favour of the ethnic box. Network of Sikh Organisations director Lord Singh said: “There are approximately 300-plus gurdwaras alone in the UK and that doesn’t include other Sikh organisations — so these numbers mean nothing, and still represent a minority view. Besides, the SFUK have exaggerated numbers in the past. Sadly, no one in the unrepresentative SFUK-run All Party Parliamentary Group for British Sikhs has taken us up on the challenge to debate their flawed and rejected Sikh ethnic tick box campaign. For a start we’d like to educate them on Sikh teachings. First lesson — Guru Nanak was the founder of a major world faith, not an ethnic group.” The ONS stuck by its report. A spokesperson said: “The religion question will have a specific Sikh tick box response option and everyone who wishes to identify as Sikh in response to the ethnicity question will be able to do so through a write-in option.” “The Census Order, setting out the questions which will be asked in the 2021 Census, will be introduced to Parliament in the autumn. Everyone has the right to self-identify and members of the Sikh population can identify as Sikh by using the write-in option provided (on both online and on paper versions of the questionnaire),” the Cabinet Office said.

Branstad visited Tibet from May 19 to 25, the first such visit by a US ambassador to China to the remote Himalayan region since 2015, where access is restricted for diplomats and journalists. During his visit, he asked the Chinese government to ""engage in substantive dialogue with the Dalai Lama or his representatives, without preconditions, to seek a settlement that resolves differences,"" according US embassy spokeswoman who briefed the media. ""He also expressed concerns regarding the Chinese government's interference in Tibetan Buddhists' freedom to organise and practice their religion,"" she said. Asked about the US envoy's call for dialogue with the Dalai Lama, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang told media here that Chinese officials had briefed the ambassador about China's religious and ethnic policies and also about socio-economic development in Tibet. It has also been made clear to him that ""the Chinese government's policy on dialogue and contact with the Dalai Lama and foreigners access to Tibet. Finally, it was also stressed that China firmly opposes any foreign interference in Tibet affairs in China's domestic affairs,"" he said. ""The ambassador thanked China for the hospitality given to him and spoke positively about socio-economic development in Tibet and said that the visit helped him have a better understanding of the situation in Tibet,"" Lu said. Beijing's permission to Branstad came after the US early this year passed the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act of 2018, warning equal and reciprocal measures if Beijing denied access to American citizens, government officials and journalists to Tibet. The new US law would impose a visa ban on Chinese officials who deny American citizens, government officials and journalists access to Tibet. Before the US's envoy's visit, Lu hoped that he would make an objective and unbiased judgement on the situation in Tibet. China, which accuses the Dalai Lama as a ""splittist"" working for Tibetan independence, has held talks with the Dalai Lama's representatives to find an amicable solution to the Tibetan issue in the past. The last such dialogue took place in 2010. The 14th Dalai Lama had fled to India in early 1959 to escape from the Chinese occupation and lives in exile in Dharamshala. Beijing criticises the Dalai Lama's demand for autonomy, saying that it is a ploy for separation of Tibet from China. Chinese officials have said in the past that the Dalai Lama's demand to unify all the Tibetan prefectures with the present Tibetan Autonomous Region and provide greater autonomy is unacceptable to Beijing. Over 120 Tibetans committed self-immolations in recent years calling for the return of the Dalai Lama from his exile in India.

In the statement carried by Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency, the North Korean spokesman said the North was rightfully exercising its rights of self-defense with the launches. ""Demanding us to ban all launches using ballistic technology regardless of range is same with asking us to relinquish our rights for self-defense,"" the spokesman said. The spokesman said Bolton was an ""ignorant"" hard-liner who throughout different U.S. administrations constantly pushed provocative policies against North Korea, which the spokesman said included endorsements of pre-emptive strikes and regime change. The spokesman also said that Bolton's ""hammer act"" was responsible for the collapse of a major nuclear deal between the countries reached in 1994, when the North agreed to halt its nuclear program in exchange for U.S. fuel aid. The deal broke down in 2002 after US intelligence agencies said North Korea was continuing its pursuit of bombs with a secret uranium enrichment program. ""Bolton should not be called a security adviser who works to secure security, but an adviser for security destruction who destroys peace and security,"" the spokesman said. ""It's not that strange that crooked sound will always come out the mouth of a man who is structurally flawed, and it's best that this defective human product goes away as soon as possible."" Experts say the weapons North Korea tested this month are new solid-fuel missiles that are potentially nuclear capable and would strengthen the North's ability to conduct strikes on targets throughout South Korea. But while expressing concern that the launches may run against the spirit of an inter-Korean military agreement reached last year to reduce tensions, South Korea has been eager to downplay the significance of the tests as it tries to keep a positive atmosphere for dialogue alive. South Korea's presidential office and military have refused to call the launches outright provocations, and have yet to confirm that the missiles were ballistic weapons, although most experts say they clearly were. ""There's no way for us to know why National Security Adviser Bolton made such comments,"" said a South Korean presidential official, who asked not to be named during a background briefing to reporters on Monday.

Negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang have been at a standstill since February, when a summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Trump broke down over what the United States described as the North's excessive demands for sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of its nuclear capabilities.

Instead of voting for candidates or policies, UK voters voted on leave or remain lines, meaning large numbers of Tories who want to leave the EU voted for the Brexit Party whist Labour voters who want to remain in the EU voted for the Liberal Democrats. The recently launched Brexit Party, led by Nigel Farage, which has no manifesto or policies, had, by Monday night, won 29 seats in the European Parliament and 32% of the vote share - campaigning on a single issue of getting the UK out of the EU. This surpassed UKIP’s result in the 2014 election when it won 27 per cent of the vote on a similar anti-EU message. The Brexit Party has now become the joint largest national party in the European Parliament, alongside Angela Merkel’s CDU/CSU party. Farage now wants his party to become part of the UK's negotiating team with Brussels. The pro-EU Liberal Democrats, who advocate a second referendum and revoking Article 50, came second nationwide and won 16 seats (20% of the vote share). The Conservatives and Labour combined received less than 25% of the votes, their worst result in any EU election. Getting nine per cent of the vote share, the Tories crashed to their worst performance since the 1830s. They lost 15 of their MEPs, leaving just four MEPs, as voters punished them for failing to deliver Brexit. Labour was also badly hit, in its case for its ambiguity on Brexit and lost 12 MEPs, winning only 10 seats and 14% of the vote share in its worst election result since 1910. For the first time the Labour party will have no MEPs in Scotland. The Greens did well and gained seven MEPs (12%) seeing its best performance since 1989, part in due to its pro-Remain stance and partly due to the Greta Thunberg effect, whilst UKIP and a pro-EU new party Change UK did not win any seats with just three per cent of the vote share each. Whilst the Brexit Party won in nine out of 11 regions, it failed to win in London, where it was beaten by the Liberal Democrats to third place and in Scotland where it was beaten by the Scottish nationalist SNP to second place. Combined the pro-Brexit parties won 35% of the vote share and the anti-Brexit parties won 40%. Turnout in Britain was among the lowest of all EU countries at 37 per cent, whilst the average across Europe was 50%. The results are likely to push the Tories to take a harder line on Brexit and push Labour, which lost votes to the Liberal Democrats, to promise a second referendum.

The Nepal Police had earlier suspected the group to be behind the incidents as pamphlets belonging to the group were discovered from the site of blasts. A handful of people from the party had been arrested. At least four people were killed while nine were injured when a series of three blasts ripped across the Nepalese capital on Sunday. The Army's bomb disposal unit has since defused bombs in areas like Koteshwor, Satdobato, Gwarko, Lagankhel and the New Buspark, to name a few. Apart from this, several vehicles were torched across parts of Nepal, leading to fear amongst the public. The streets bore a deserted look across Kathmandu on Monday in the wake of the attack. The banned splinter group criticised the Government in the release which was issued late Monday evening. This is not the first time that a blast by the group has claimed lives. In March, a blast targeting Ncell (a private telecom company) office in Nakhhu, Lalitpur killed one civilian. With the arrest and discovery of bombs at four different places on Sunday, criticism against the group has increased and the public has urged the government to sit down with the warring group to reach a consensus.

"69524413"|"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/future-uncertain-for-catalan-separatists-elected-in-europe/articleshow/69524413.cms"|"[AP]"|"MADRID: Three jailed or fugitive Catalan politicians hope to use their freshly won seats in the European Parliament as loudspeakers for their separatist cause in northeastern Spain - although actually being sworn in as lawmakers will be the first obstacle they have to overcome. The European careers of Catalonia's former regional President Carles Puigdemont, his former No. 2 Oriol Junqueras and ex Cabinet member Toni Comin depend on a slew of electoral rules and judicial decisions. Ironically, those give more chances to the jailed Junqueras than to his two colleagues, who fled to Belgium following an unprecedented push for Catalan independence in 2017. Puigdemont's and Comin's attempts to continue internationalizing their cause from the European Parliament could be thwarted unless they expose themselves to arrest by traveling to Madrid to pick up their lawmaker credentials and taking an oath before Spain's Central Electoral Board, says an internal regional chamber report that The Associated Press has had access to. Asked during a press briefing how he plans to claim his seat, Puigdemont said on Monday that he believes the Spanish government ""wants to win in (legal) chambers what they have lost in the ballots."" ""We are ready for that battle,'' he said, addressing journalists in Barcelona by video link. Junqueras took a different strategy when he was indicted following the staging of a banned referendum and a short-lived independence declaration at the end of October 2017. He stayed put in Catalonia, showed up in court in Madrid when his summons arrived and has been in preventive custody on preliminary rebellion charges for most of the past two years. The 50-year-old has also turned the ongoing televised Supreme Court trial against separatists into a campaign platform, widening support for his left-wing republican party in regional, national and the recent European elections. The conundrum now is whether he will be allowed to take his seat and, if denied - as happened last week after he obtained a seat in the Spanish Congress of Deputies - who will take on the politically sensitive task of removing an elected politician, further enraging his base of supporters. The European Parliament says that it's up to Spain's electoral board to decide whether Junqueras is in the final list of elected lawmakers that Spanish authorities need to submit to Strasbourg. That leaves the decision in the hands of Supreme Court judges, who need to grant Junqueras temporary permission to leave jail and obtain his lawmaker credentials. The same panel of judges did allow him to be sworn in as a national lawmaker last week, although he was immediately suspended by the parliament, citing a Spanish criminal law article that bans those in jail due to a rebellion indictment from holding public office. It's unclear if the same article would apply to the European plans of Junqueras, who calls himself a ""political prisoner,"" or if he will manage to be sworn in at least as a symbolic voice in the heart of Europe, assuming that he won't be able to vote from jail. All votes in the European Parliament need to be cast from the plenary chamber. One way or another, Junqueras told the AP last week in an interview via videoconference from jail, he plans to defend his rights in all levels and before all possible judicial institutions.

Standing beside Trump at a news conference after hours of talks, Abe disagreed with the US president, saying the missile tests violated UN Security Council resolutions and were ""of great regret."" Abe, who has forged a strong friendship with Trump and agrees with him on many issues, is concerned because the short-range missiles pose a threat to Japan's security. Trump was invited to Japan to be the first world leader to meet with its new emperor. Despite being far from Washington, he didn't miss the chance to lob another broadside against former Vice President Joe Biden, one of the Democrats seeking to challenge Trump in next year's presidential election. North Korea's Kim Jong Un recently criticized Biden as having a low IQ, and Trump told the world he agreed with the authoritarian leader's assessment. The visit was designed to highlight the US-Japan alliance and showcase the warm relations between the leaders. Trump said he and Abe deliberated over economic issues, including trade and Iran, during hours of talks at the Akasaka Palace, but North Korea's recent firing of short-range missiles emerged as an area of disagreement. When asked if he was bothered by the missile tests, Trump said: ""No, I'm not. I am personally not."" The Republican president has sought to downplay the significance of the missile tests, even though his own national security adviser, John Bolton, said over the weekend that they violated UN resolutions. Trump continues to hold out hope of getting Kim to agree to give up his nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, despite two summits he's had with the North Korean leader that produced no concrete pledge to denuclearize the peninsula. Trump praised Kim, calling him a ""smart man"" who might have launched the missiles earlier this month to ""get attention."" ""All I know is there have been no nuclear tests, no ballistic missiles going out, no long-range missiles going out and I think that someday we'll have a deal,"" Trump said, adding that he is in ""no rush."" Trump is correct that North Korea has not recently tested a long-range missile that could reach the US. But earlier this month, North Korea fired off a series of short-range missiles that alarmed US allies in closer proximity to North Korea, including Japan. The tests broke a pause in North Korea's ballistic missile launches that began in late 2017. Abe reiterated his previous statement that the tests were conducted in defiance of the UN. ""This is violating the Security Council resolution,"" Abe said, adding that, as North Korea's neighbour, Japan feels threatened. ""It is of great regret. But at the same time between Kim Jong Un and President Trump a certain new approach was taken and that is something that I pay tribute to."" Earlier Monday, Trump said he backed Abe's interest in leveraging his country's good relations with Iran to help broker a possible dialogue between the US and its nemesis in the Middle East. Abe said he is willing to do whatever he can to help to reduce escalating tensions between the US and Iran. Trump and Abe discussed the issue earlier Monday. Abe could visit Iran next month. ""Peace and stability of (the) Middle East is very important for Japan and the United States and also for the international community as a whole,"" Abe said. The leaders held hours of talks after the US president - at Abe's invitation - became the first world leader to meet Japan's new emperor, Naruhito, who ascended to the throne May 1. The meeting with Naruhito and his wife, Empress Masako, was preceded by a grand outdoor welcome ceremony at Japan's Imperial Palace, where Trump walked solo across red carpets, reviewing Japanese troops as the guest of honour. Trump's official visit also included golf with Abe, presenting a trophy to a sumo wrestling champion and a black-tie banquet at the palace. The visit included hours of one-on-one time for Trump and Abe, who has been trying to remain on Trump's good side despite disagreements between them on trade and other issues. Trump didn't hold back at the news conference when he was asked about Biden, declaring himself ""not a fan."" ""Kim Jong Un made a statement that Joe Biden is a low-IQ individual,"" Trump said, adding that Kim probably based his assessment on Biden's record and ""I probably agree with him on that."" US officeholders usually avoid engaging in politics while on foreign soil, hewing to the adage that politics stops at the water's edge. But Trump's sharp attack on Biden, through his declaration of agreement with Kim, set aside that long-standing norm. Trump and Abe largely glossed over their difference on trade, despite the potentially crippling tariffs on foreign autos that Trump is threatening to impose on Japan and the European Union. Trump declined to say what Japan would have to do to avoid those tariffs, but complained of an ""unbelievably large"" trade imbalance with the nation. Still, he said he expects to reach trade deals at some point with both Japan and China, but wouldn't rush it.

Claude Moraes and Neena Gill, the first ever Indian-origin MEPs elected in 1999, both kept their seats and a new face emerged of self-made multimillionaire Dinesh Dhamija. By Monday with 11 of 12 regions declared, Dhamija, 69, son of late Indian diplomat Jagan Nath Dhamija, had become an MEP for the Liberal Democrats. He is one of eight MEPs who will represent London, where his party topped the polls, one of only two regions in Britain to beat the Brexit Party. Educated at Mayo College, Ajmer and St Xavier’s School in Delhi, Dhamija made his millions when he sold his internet travel company eBookers in 2005. “The reason why I stood is because of the hate crimes against Asians in the aftermath of the EU referendum 2016. Until then I had been doing back office work for the Lib Dems and that is why I wanted to stand on the frontline,” he said. “As part of the EU, which has GDP worth US$ 18 trillion a year, we have much better negotiating power than as the UK with just US$3 trillion. The Brexit Party did not win in London and London produces 30 per cent of the UK’s GDP,” Dhamija added. Born in Australia, he read law at Cambridge and studied at IMD in Lausanne and Harvard Business School. “I will try and help India too,” he said.

Addressing a meeting on Sunday organised by the Pakistan-China Institute (PCI), the senior Chinese leader said the world was passing through a time of major developments and transformation. The situation, he emphasised, had been further complicated by traditional and non-traditional challenges and conflict between opposing schools of thought and culture. ""No matter how the international landscape changes, China will always stand by Pakistan's core interests, and both Pakistan and China have made the right choice based on equality and mutual benefit,"" Wang said. Wang, a member of the politburo of the ruling Communist Party of China, said that the spirit of the Silk Road binds the two countries together with a common heritage and history. He also appreciated the success of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and said that the second phase of the project would even bring more benefits for both Pakistan and China. The CPEC, launched in 2015, is a planned network of roads, railways and energy projects linking China's resource-rich Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region with Pakistan's strategic Gwadar Port on the Arabian Sea. ""The CPEC has come a long way over the past five years. The CPEC is rapidly extending to new priority areas including industrial parks and livelihoods,"" he said. The Chinese leader said that China and Pakistan were all-weather strategic partners. He recalled Pakistan's support for China at ""critical moments"" and said that his country always supported Pakistan to achieve core interests. He said that the CPEC was a manifestation of their collaborative relations. Wang also referred to the international situation and said that despite challenges, the way forward is globalisation, free trade and people-to-people connectivity. Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said that the CPEC was a binding force between Pakistan and China. Citing the recent visit of Prime Minister Imran Khan to China for the Belt and Road Forum, he praised the CPEC for contributing to the progress of Pakistan.

The MoU - signed this week and case specific to 68-year-old Dar - provides legal basis in the absence of an extradition treaty, Geo TV reported. It's understood that the MoU was signed after Prime Minister Imran Khan's adviser on accountability Shahzad Akbar held talks with British home secretary Sajid Javid, it said. Dar, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz leader, left Pakistan soon after a court began hearings against him in a graft case filed in line with the Supreme Court's July 2017 Panama Papers verdict. After his arrival in London, he underwent treatment for heart related ailment at a Harley Street hospital. The MoU states that the government of Pakistan and the British government have developed an understanding ""for the extradition of Ishaq Dar to the jurisdiction of the government of Pakistan,"" the channel said. The document, signed by Graeme Biggar, the new Justice and Accountability focal person for Pakistan on behalf of home secretary Javid and Akbar stated that the MoU means the ""surrender to the government of Pakistan of Dar for the purpose of prosecution there for one or more offences and for the purpose of serving a sentence of imprisonment"", it added. The MoU states that it provides for ""more effective cooperation in combating crime"". The case of asset beyond means was launched against Dar in September 2017 on the orders of Supreme Court after it disqualified Nawaz Sharif and ordered corruption cases against him, his children Maryam Nawaz, Husain and Hasan and son-in-law (retd) Captain Muhammad Safdar. The anti-corruption watchdog already seized all of movable and immovable assets of Dar located in Lahore and Islamabad. According to the case, Dar acquired assets worth Rs 831.7 million, which was disproportionate to the known sources of his income. The Panama Papers case is about alleged money laundering by Sharif in the 1990s when he twice served as Pakistan's prime minister to purchase assets in London. Citing a source familiar with the development, the channel said that it's a big step towards Pakistan's efforts for the extradition of Dar in the absence of a treaty -- the only possibility of someone's extradition is by way of a special arrangement for the extradition of a specific person. In recent years, the UK has made such special arrangements with the government of Rwanda and once with Taiwan. The source claimed that the MoU means that the UK govt is satisfied that Pakistan is a suitable extradition destination and the UK is ready to consider extraditing the former minister once the laws of England and Wales are met. The source said the principle of dual criminality is met in this case and the offences alleged are extradition offences which include every offence that is imprisonable for more than one year and doesn't involve death penalty. Citing a government source, the channel said that in the next two weeks Pakistani government will send material to the secretary of state for the extradition of Dar and it is hoped that the secretary of state will accelerate the process. The British government had told Pakistan that it was ready to sign an extradition treaty with Pakistan with the exception of offences resulting in death sentence upon conviction. Pakistan agreed to accept that condition of UK by providing appropriate assurances in such cases in future and following that Akbar visited London this week. The UK had told Pakistan that the treaty with Pakistan cannot be signed on the grounds that the latter has not abolished death sentence and cited it a matter of human rights. Recently, the cabinet approved amendments in the laws in this connection.

With results announced early Monday for all of England and Wales, the Brexit Party had won 28 of the 73 British EU seats up for grabs and almost a third of the votes. The Liberal Democrats took about 20% of the vote and 15 seats up from only one at the last EU election in 2014. Labour came third with 10 seats, followed by the Greens with seven. The ruling Conservatives apparently blamed by voters for failing to deliver Brexit in March as planned were in fifth place with just three EU seats and under 10% of the vote. The vote was more or less split between Farage's pro-Brexit forces and the pro-EU Liberal Democrats and Greens at the expense of the more established parties. Scotland and Northern Ireland are due to announce their results later. Farage's Brexit Party was one of several nationalist and populist parties making gains across the continent in an election that saw erosion of support for the traditionally dominant political parties. A triumphant Farage said his party will ""stun everbody'' in the next British general election if the country still hasn't left the European Union. ``We're not just here to leave the European Union but to try and fundamentally change the shape of British politics, bring it into the 21st century and get a Parliament that better reflects the country,'' he said. Farage's gains helped consign the Conservative Party to a dismal showing. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who is contending to become party leader and prime minister, said it was a ``painful result'' and warned there was an ""existential risk to our party unless we now come together and get Brexit done.'' The results reflect an electorate deeply divided over Britain's 2016 decision to leave the EU, but united in anger at the two long-dominant parties, the Conservatives and Labour, who have brought the Brexit process to deadlock. Some senior Labour figures said after the party's weak performance that it must now take a strong stance in favor of a second referendum on Brexit, but party leader Jeremy Corbyn declined to make his positon clear. He still says the country needs either a general election or a referendum on Brexit. ""With the Conservatives disintegrating and unable to govern, and parliament deadlocked, this issue will have to go back to the people, whether through a general election or a public vote,'' he said, promising more ""conversations'' in the coming days. Britain is participating in the EU election because it is still a member of the bloc, but the lawmakers it elects will only sit in the European Parliament until the country leaves the EU, which is currently scheduled for October 31. Farage's Brexit Party was officially launched in April and has only one policy: for Britain to leave the EU as soon as possible, even without a divorce agreement in place. But the election leaves Britain's EU exit ever more uncertain, with both Brexiteers and pro-EU ``remainers'' able to claim strong support. Labour and the Conservatives, who in different ways each sought a compromise Brexit, were hammered. The result raises the likelihood of a chaotic ""no deal'' exit from the EU, but also of a new referendum that could reverse the decision to leave. The Conservatives were punished for failing to take the country out of the EU on March 29 as promised, a failure that led Prime Minister Theresa May to announce Friday that she is stepping down from leading the party on June 7. Britain's new prime minister will be whoever wins the Conservative party leadership race to replace her. The favorites, including ex-Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, have vowed to leave the EU on Oct. 31 even if there is no deal in place. Most businesses and economists think that would cause economic turmoil and plunge Britain into recession. But many Conservatives think embracing a no-deal Brexit may be the only way to win back voters from Farage's party. Labour paid for a fence-sitting Brexit policy that saw the party dither over whether to support a new referendum that could halt Brexit. Labour foreign affairs spokeswoman Emily Thornberry said the party needed to adopt a clearer pro-EU stance. ""There should be a (new Brexit) referendum and we should campaign to remain,'' she said.

The PTM was leading a sit-in against the alleged assault of a local woman in the remote area near the border with Afghanistan when reports about violence at a protest started pouring in. According to local sources, unidentified individuals opened fire on the crowd of protesters after which Ali Wazir, a senior PTM leader and National Assembly member, was taken into custody along with eight others. Mohsin Dawar, another PTM leader and lawmaker, received a minor hand injury. In the afternoon, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the Pakistan army’s media wing, issued a statement, saying a check post in the area was assaulted by a group and three people were killed and 15 injured, including soldiers, in the exchange of fire. “A group led by Mohsin Dawar and Ali Wazir assaulted Kharqamar check post, Boyya, North Waziristan tribal district, this morning. They wanted to exert pressure for the release of a suspected facilitator of terrorists who was arrested the other day,” the statement read without specifying who the suspect was. “Troops at the check post exercised maximum restraint in the face of provocation and direct firing on the post. Due to firing by the group, five army soldiers were injured. In the exchange of fire, three individuals who attacked the post lost their lives and 10 got injured,” it added. The PTM leadership has yet to issue a statement regarding the incident. Following the incident, curfew was imposed in North Waziristan and landline, internet and cell phone services have been suspended. The military accuses the PTM of receiving funds from Indian and Afghan intelligence agencies and vows that the state will take legal action against the group. The PTM, however, rejects these charges, arguing that it is very easy for the military and spy agencies to label people (Pashtuns, Balochs) who raise their voice for their rights as agents of RAW and Afghanistan’s National Directorate of Security (NDS). The PTM rose to prominence last year after the extra-judicial killing of Naqeebullah Mehsud, a young Pashtun model from Waziristan, in a fake police encounter in Karachi. Ignored completely by the local media and mainstream political parties for their strong views against the security establishment, the PTM had staged massive protests and rallies in different parts of the country against enforced disappearances, extrajudicial arrests and killings, as well as the mistreatment of the Pashtun community by security forces. “Yeh jo dehshatgardi hai, iss ke peechay wardi hai (The uniform is to be blamed for terrorism)” is the movement’s main slogan.

While Johnson, the former foreign secretary, is seen as the frontrunner to succeed May, the contest still remains wide open to at least seven other contenders. May had announced her resignation earlier this week and is set to formally step down as Tory leader and PM on June 7, after a three-day state visit to the UK by US President Donald Trump. The formal segment of the party leadership contest will then kick off on June 10, but prospective candidates have already begun laying out their bids for the top job. UK environment secretary Michael Gove became the latest Tory MP to announce his intention to challenge Johnson on Sunday. ""I can confirm that I will be putting my name forward to be prime minister of this country. I believe that I'm ready to unite the Conservative and Union Party, ready to deliver Brexit, and ready to lead this great country,"" he told reporters outside his home in London on Sunday. Gove's decision is reminiscent of the 2016 leadership race, when he was accused of betraying Johnson by withdrawing his support for him and choosing to contest himself. It led to Johnson withdrawing his bid and Gove went on to lose out in the party ballot, resulting in May being chosen for the post. Among some of the other contenders eyeing Downing Street include the former Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, and former Commons leader Andrea Leadsom - both of whom confirmed their leadership bids in different Sunday newspapers. They joined UK foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt, international development secretary Rory Stewart, health secretary Matt Hancock, and former work and pensions secretary Esther McVey, in the battle for the leadership. All the leadership contenders must make their position on Brexit clear to their electors - the 313 Tory MPs who choose a shortlist and the 124,000 party members who will have the ultimate say on the final two contenders who will go head to head in the race. May's announcement to resign has increased the chances of the UK exiting from the European Union without any deal on October 31 -- the deadline set by EU leaders. A no-deal Brexit would face fierce opposition in the parliament, including from the ruling Conservative Party lawmakers who backed staying in the EU. Some of the PM hopefuls have said they will seek to negotiate changes to a draft divorce agreement struck with the EU last year but would be ready to go with a no-deal Brexit if refused. The EU has already made it clear that it will not renegotiate the terms of the deal. A dividing line has emerged between candidates such as Johnson, who say the UK must be ready to leave the EU on October 31 without a deal, and those who oppose a such no-deal Brexit like Stewart who said he would not serve in the Cabinet of someone “explicitly pushing for a no-deal Brexit"". The Opposition Labour Party also remains divided over the issue, with one section still pushing for a second referendum on the final Brexit deal and the other calling for a common Customs Union with the EU. ""I think the responsibility is on all of those opposition parties to come together with us and some Conservative MPs to block a 'no deal' and if that means going back to the people, yes let's go back to the people,"" said Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell. Meanwhile, May is set to continue as Prime Minister while the leadership contest takes place. Tory MPs have until the week beginning June 10 to put their names forward, and any of them can stand as long as they have the backing of two parliamentary colleagues. The candidates will then be whittled down by votes of MPs until two remain, and in July a postal ballot of all Tory party members will be held to decide the winner. The last leader elected by the Tory party membership was David Cameron in 2005. May was chosen unopposed in 2016 after Leadsom withdrew her candidature at the last minute.

El Reno Mayor Matt White said during a news conference that ""there have been two fatalities at this point in time,"" adding that officials are currently working to notify relatives. White said search and rescue efforts are continuing. National Weather Service meteorologist Rick Smith in Norman told The Associated Press that the suspected twister hit El Reno on Saturday night as a powerful storm system rolled through the state. Crews were expected to arrive on the scene Sunday to determine the severity of the damage to the town located just west of Oklahoma City. The American Budget Value Inn was destroyed by the storm. Images from the scene showed emergency crews sifting through rubble after part of the motel's second story collapsed into a pile of debris strewn about the first floor and parking lot. Elsewhere, overturned cars and twisted metal could be seen briefly as intermittent lightning flashed across the sky and the wailing sirens of approaching emergency vehicles were heard in the distance. Trailers at the Skyview Estates mobile home park adjacent to the motel also were damaged, as was part of a nearby car dealership. ""We have absolutely experienced a traumatic event,'' White said during an earlier news conference Sunday. White said several people were transported to hospitals in Oklahoma City, but did not give an exact number. ""We're doing a search and rescue right now ... we have all hands on deck,'' White said. Saturday night's storm in El Reno comes after a week of tornados, severe rain and flooding in the Southern Plains and Midwest, including a tornado that hit Jefferson City, Missouri. The region's most recent spate of bad weather and flooding has been blamed for at least nine deaths. Tweety Garrison, 63, told The Associated Press early Sunday that she was inside her mobile home - along with her husband, two young grandchildren and a family friend - when the storm hit. Garrison said when she heard the storm coming she immediately hit the ground. Moments later, she said, she heard the mobile home next door slam into hers, before it flipped over and landed on her roof. Garrison said the incident lasted five to 10 minutes. She said there was a tornado warning on her phone but the sirens did not go off until after tornado hit. Garrison's 32-year-old son, Elton, said he'd heard the wailing tornado sirens and had just laid down at home about a half-mile (.8 kilometer) away when his phone rang. He recognized his mother's number, but there was no voice on the other end when he answered. ""I thought, `That's weird,''' Elton Garrison said. Then his mother called back, and delivered a chilling message: ""We're trapped.'' Elton said when he arrived at his parent's home, he found it blocked by debris and sitting with another trailer on top of it. He immediately began clearing a path to the home so that he could eventually lift a portion of an outside wall just enough so that all five occupants could slip beneath it and escape. ""My parents were in there and two of my kids, one 9 and the other 12 ... my main emotion was fear,'' Garrison said, who has lived in El Reno for about 26 years. ""I couldn't get them out of there quick enough.'' Garrison said he was not alarmed by the warning sirens when he first heard them at home. ``We hear them all the time here, so it didn't seem like a big deal ... I heard a lot of rain with the wind. But when it kinda got calm all of a sudden, that's when it didn't feel right."" Garrison, whose sport utility vehicle remained at the mobile park early Sunday because the area had since been cordoned off by authorities, said his parents had only recently recovered after losing their previous home to a fire a few years ago. ""Now this,"" he said, before expressing gratitude that everyone inside his parents' home had emerged without serious injury. In the next breath, Garrison added: ""Items can be replaced. Lives can't."" Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."|"2 dead after tornado roars through Oklahoma town"|"Sun May 26 18:06:00 CEST 2019"|"[world]"

With the ceremonial launch of ‘Ural’, Russia’s Rosatom Atomic Energy Corporation, which is the main equipment supplier for India’s Kudankulam nuclear power plant, has completed another step towards ensuring all-year round navigability of the Northern sea route. Ural is one of the three ships that when completed will be the largest and most powerful icebreakers in the world, a statement from Rosatom said. In April, President Vladimir Putin had said that Russia was stepping up construction of icebreakers with the aim of boosting freight traffic along its Arctic coast. The move would strengthen Russia’s hand in the high north as it competes with traditional rivals US, China, Canada and Norway. The Arctic holds oil and gas reserves equivalent to 412 billion barrels of oil, about 22% of the world’s undiscovered oil and gas, US Geological Survey estimates. The 173-metre-long Ural is equipped with two highly efficient and compact RITM-200 nuclear reactors on board, capable of generating up to 350MW combined, allowing the ship to break through ice as thick as three meters. The RITM-200 type reactor makes its world debut on the Ural as well as on its sister vessels the ‘Arktik’ and the ‘Sibir’ before Rosatom deploys it in floating nuclear power plants. On the ceremonial launch, Rosatom director general Alexey Likhachev said: “The Ural together with its sisters are central to our strategic project of opening the northern sea route (NSR) to all-year activity. Our goal for 2024 is for more than 80 million metric tons of shipments to pass through the NSR. We also plan to add two more project 22220 ships to our nuclear icebreaker fleet by 2027. The contract for construction of these icebreakers is expected to be signed by the end of this August.” Another unique feature of the project 22220 vessels, including the Ural, is its dual-draught design. Ballast tanks inside its hull can be adjusted easily to alter the ship’s draught (vertical distance between the waterline and the bottom of the hull) depending on whether the vessel needs to navigate the Arctic sea or shallow river estuaries. With this smart design solution, Rosatom is essentially getting two types of ice-breakers for the price of one, representing a potential cost saving of hundreds of millions of dollars.

Hiking officials attributed most of the deaths to weakness, exhaustion and delays on the crowded route to the 8,850-metre (29,035 feet) summit. Robin Haynes Fisher, 44, died in the so-called ""death zone"" known for low levels of oxygen on descent from the summit, Mira Acharya, a tourism department official, said. He is the eighth fatality on Everest in the current climbing season that ends this month. ""He died because of weakness after a long ascent and difficult descent,"" Murari Sharma of the Everest Parivar Treks company that arranged his logistics told Reuters. ""He was descending with his sherpa guides from the summit when he suddenly fainted."" Fellow guides changed Fisher's oxygen bottle and offered him water, but could not save him, Sharma said. Garrett Madison of the U.S. based Madison Mountaineering company that sponsors climbers to Mount Everest said many were not ""well qualified or prepared climbers"" and were without the support necessary to ascend and descend safely. ""If they were with a strong and experienced team they would have likely been fine, but with minimal support, once something goes wrong it's tough to get back on course,"" Madison told Reuters. Mount Everest can also be climbed from Tibet and casualties have been reported from there this season too.

In a letter on her Twitter account, Josefa Gonzalez-Blanco said she resigned because she delayed the departure of a flight that had waited for her to start a working trip. Lopez Obrador, who took office Dec. 1, has promised a government without privileges or corruption. ``There is no justification,'' the minister of the environment and natural resources said in the letter. ``The true transformation of Mexico requires a total congruence with the values of equity and justice. No one should have privileges and one's benefit, even if it is to fulfill one's functions, should not be put above the welfare of the majority.'' The delay of the flight for more than half an hour had generated criticism from other passengers and the media. Gonzalez-Blanco's resignation comes four days after that of German Martinez Cazares, head of the Mexican Social Security Institute, the country's main public health system. In his resignation, Martinez Cazares lashed out at health spending cuts. Lopez Obrador himself has gotten rid of his presidential guard and travels on commercial flights. On Tuesday, he said that since he imposed a rule requiring public officials receive approval for international trips, he has received about 100 petitions and approved only 20.

The four days of balloting that began Thursday across the 28-country European Union pitted supporters of closer unity against those who consider the EU a meddlesome and bureaucratic presence and want to return power to national governments and sharply restrict immigration. Italy's interior minister Matteo Salvini, seen as a unifying force among the anti-migrant hard-line nationalists, said that he felt a ""change in the air"" and that a victory by his right-wing League party would ""change everything in Europe."" The first full results were expected overnight from what was considered the most important European Parliament election in decades, a contest with the potential to significantly reshape EU policies. An estimated 426 million people were eligible to vote. Mainstream centre-right and centre-left parties were widely expected to hold on to power in the 751-seat legislature that sits in both Brussels and Strasbourg. But the nationalist and populist parties that are hostile to the EU were expected to make important gains that could complicate the workings of the Parliament. In the first major exit poll, in Germany, the EU's biggest country, governing parties were predicted to lose ground while the Greens were set for big gains. The far right was also expected to pick up more support. ""I don't want to see a right-populist Europe (that) wants to destroy the idea of togetherness,"" said Germany's Manfred Weber, the lead candidate of the Christian Democrat center-right EPP group, currently the biggest in the legislature. Hungary's increasingly authoritarian prime minister Viktor Orban, a possible ally of Salvini, said he hopes the election will bring a shift toward political parties that want to stop migration. The migration issue ""will reorganize the political spectrum in the European Union,"" he said. Because of the stakes this time, turnout appeared to be running higher than usual during the afternoon Sunday in Spain, France and Germany. The trend has been downward since the first elections in 1979 and stood at less than 43 percent five years ago. In France, the interior ministry said turnout was over 43 per cent at 5 p.m., compared with 35 per cent at the same time in 2014. Several French polling institutes estimated the final turnout could be over 50 per cent at the end of the day, which would be a first in the country since 1994. The EU and its Parliament set trade policy on the continent, regulate agriculture, oversee antitrust enforcement and set monetary policy for 19 of the 28 nations sharing the euro currency. Other countries voting on Sunday included Italy, Poland, Portugal, Denmark, Sweden, Austria, Belgium and Lithuania. Britain voted Thursday, taking part in the balloting even though it is planning to leave the EU, after the government missed its March 29 deadline to approve withdrawal terms. Its EU lawmakers would lose their jobs as soon as Brexit happens. Europe has been roiled in the past few years by immigration from the Mideast and Africa and deadly attacks by Islamic extremists. It has also seen rising tensions over economic inequality and growing hostility toward the political establishment — sentiments not unlike those that got Donald Trump elected in the US. Traditional parties like the EPP and the center-left socialist S&D group want the mainstream to build a strong coalition to stave off the fringe parties. Spanish caretaker Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez called on ""all the political forces to open a horizon of political stability."" Projections released by the Parliament last month showed the EPP bloc losing 37 of its 217 seats and the S&D group dropping from 186 seats to 149. On the far-right flank, the Europe of Nations and Freedom group was predicted to increase its bloc from 37 to 62 seats. Proponents of stronger EU integration, led by French President Emmanuel Macron , argue that issues like climate change and reining in immigration are simply too big for any one country to tackle alone. Macron, whose country has been rocked in recent months by the populist yellow vest movement, has called the elections ""the most important since 1979 because the Union is facing an existential risk"" from nationalists seeking to divide the bloc. Once the elections are over, European leaders will begin the task of selecting candidates for the top jobs in the EU's headquarters in Brussels. The leaders meet for a summit over dinner Tuesday. Current European lawmakers' terms end July 1, and the new parliament will be seated the following day.

The president, first lady Melania Trump, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife, Akie, are joining an estimated 11,500 people at Ryogoku Kokugikan Stadium for Sunday's match. Trump will then be stepping into the ring to present the champion an eagle-topped trophy called ""The President's Cup"" — the first American president to do so. The honor is part of a charm offensive Abe continued Sunday as he courts Trump with three things close to his heart: wrestling matches, burgers and golf. Call it sumo diplomacy. Trump's four-day state visit to Japan is designed to demonstrate the strength of the bond between the nations. The president received a warm welcome as he arrived at Mobara Country Club, south of Tokyo, for a steamy morning round of golf with the Japanese leader. It was their fifth golf outing. Abe is pulling out all the stops as he seeks to placate Trump amid growing US-Japan trade tensions and the threat of auto tariffs. Japan is also contending with the continued threat of North Korea and Trump's apparent dismissal of Pyongyang's recent tests of short-range missiles that could reach Japan. But minus several antagonistic tweets, Sunday was all about bromance and keeping Trump happy. First it was the golf course, where Trump and Abe played 16 holes, joined by Japanese professional golfer Isao Aoki. Aoki, who is famous for his putting technique, was expected to present Trump with a putter he designed. Japanese officials said Trump and Abe also had breakfast and lunch together. On the menu for lunch: double cheeseburgers made with US beef. Next, Abe introduced Trump to Japan's ancient sport of sumo wrestling — something Trump has said he said he finds ""fascinating."" The president was sitting ringside at the match in low-back chair, breaking the custom of sitting cross-legged on a mat. Trump will present the winner with his own ""President's Cup"" trophy, which the White House displayed in the fancy hotel where Trump is staying throughout the afternoon. Its weighs more than 60 pounds. The Japan Sumo Association instituted some safety precautions because of Trump, including halving the number of same-day tickets sold. Ticket holders also are having their bags checked at the entrance, and canned and bottled drinks are banned. The throwing of zabuton cushions that participants sit on — something that's traditionally done to express disappointment — also is banned. The leaders will later venture into Tokyo to a Hibachi restaurant for a dinner double date with their wives, who also get along well together. On Monday, Trump will receive the honor of being the first foreign leader to meet with Japan's new emperor, Naruhito, since he ascended to the throne on May 1. Trump and Abe will also meet in a more formal setting and participate in a joint news conference. In the evening, Trump will be guest of honor at a banquet hosted by the emperor at Japan's Imperial Palace. It's all part of a charm offensive that began before Trump took office, when Abe rushed to New York to greet the president-elect at Trump Tower. Japan is deeply dependent on the US for security and Abe has tried to encourage Trump to maintain international agreements and keep up pressure on North Korea. Golf, in particular, has been a bonding tool for the leaders, who both enjoy a love of the game. ""We were able to exchange our views frankly in a cozy atmosphere. It was wonderful,"" Abe told reporters as he returned to his official residence mid-day. He's told reporters as he left for Mobara that Sunday's weather was great for golf and ""it seems we are in a good mood for sumo."" He later tweeted a selfie photo of him and Trump, smiling widely on the greens. Trump tweeted that he'd had ""Great fun and meeting with Prime Minister (at)AbeShinzo,"" but also continued to stew about domestic politics, claiming that, ""Numerous Japanese officials told me that the Democrats would rather see the United States fail than see me or the Republican Party succeed - Death Wish!"" There has long been a tradition of American presidents and candidates holding their tongues about rivals while on foreign soil — but Trump is not one to abide by such norms. Earlier, Trump had gone after one of his potential Democratic rivals, former President Joe Biden, saying he'd smiled when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ""called Swampman Joe Biden a low IQ individual, & worse."" He also downplayed North Korea's recent series of short-range missile tests. He tweeted that the tests weren't a concern for him — even though they most certainly are for Japan, due to the country's proximity to the North. ""North Korea fired off some small weapons, which disturbed some of my people, and others, but not me,"" Trump wrote in a message that appeared to undermine his national security adviser, John Bolton, who told reporters Saturday the tests violated UN Security Council resolutions. The president's attendance at the annual summer sumo tournament in Tokyo may bring back memories of the time he spent promoting the World Wrestling Federation. Trump sponsored major events, appeared in bits, and was inducted into the World Wrestling Entertainment Hall of Fame in 2013. The president also sought to manage expectations that he and Abe will make significant headway on trade issues when they hold more formal talks on Monday. Trump has been seeking a bilateral trade agreement with Tokyo since he pulled the U.S. out of the multinational Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement two years ago, though analysts expect no breakthroughs during Trump's visit. ""Great progress being made in our Trade Negotiations with Japan. Agriculture and beef heavily in play. Much will wait until after their July elections where I anticipate big numbers!"" he wrote, referring to Japan's upcoming parliamentary elections. Trump had told business leaders after arriving in Tokyo on Saturday evening that the US and Japan were ""hard at work"" negotiating a new bilateral trade agreement that he said would benefit both countries. ""With this deal we hope to address the trade imbalance, remove barriers to United States exports, and ensure fairness and reciprocity in our relationship. And we're getting closer,"" he said. The Trump administration has been threatening Japan with new tariffs on imports of autos and auto parts on national security grounds. Trump has suggested he will impose tariffs if the US can't wrest concessions from Japan and the European Union. In April, Japan's trade surplus surged almost 18% to 723 billion yen ($6.6 billion).

Demonstrators took to the streets holding yellow umbrellas that read ""Support Freedom, Oppose Evil Laws."" Some people carried a black coffin, while others wheeled white crosses and the numbers 6 and 4 — a nod to the day on June 4, 1989, when leaders of China's ruling Communist Party ordered the military to re-take Tiananmen Square from student-led protesters. Hundreds, if not thousands, of unarmed protesters and onlookers were killed late on June 3 and in the early hours of June 4 as a result of the martial action. Commemorations of the historic event are strictly banned in mainland China, and those who attempt to raise awareness of or merely discuss it are often punished by authorities. Groups such as the ""Tiananmen Mothers"" are pressured to stay quiet about the children they lost, while others are detained for making even subtle tributes to the occasion. The semi-autonomous territory of Hong Kong, however, holds yearly vigils and other gatherings to remember the deceased and pay tribute to the spirit of the protests. This year in Hong Kong, the march took on additional significance as opposition to changes to an extradition law widely seen as eroding the territory's independent legal system. Revisions to the law would make it easier to send criminal suspects to mainland China, where critics say they could face vague national security charges and unfair trials. ""Recently, we are facing the challenge of this (extradition law), which affects our basic freedom and liberty,"" said Albert Ho, who organized Sunday's march. He is chairman of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China. ""The dedication and the commitment to fight for democracy and human rights is the only way out,"" said Ho, who added that he hopes more people will become aware of the situation facing Hong Kong as legislators debate the proposed amendments.

Strains have increased between Iran and the United States, which is a firm backer of Tehran's regional rival Saudi Arabia, in the wake of this month's attack on oil tankers in the Gulf region that Washington has blamed on Iran. Tehran has distanced itself from the bombings, but the United States has sent a aircraft carrier and an extra 1,500 troops to the Gulf, sparking concerns about the risks of conflict in a volatile region. Khan, who has been seeking to improve Pakistan's strained relations with neighbour Iran, said he was concerned about the ""rising tensions in the Gulf"", but did not specifically name the United States or Saudi Arabia. ""He underscored that war was not a solution to any problem,"" Khan's office said in a statement late on Friday, citing the premier. ""Further escalation in tensions in the already volatile region was not in anyone's interest. All sides needed to exercise maximum restraint in the current situation."" Washington has been seeking to increasingly tighten sanctions against Iran, as relations continue to worsen under President Donald Trump. At the end of the two-day visit to Pakistan, Zarif told Iranian state-run news wire IRNA that US allegations against Tehran were increasing tensions. ""These actions are also a threat to global peace and stability,"" he said. Earlier this month, four tankers, including two belonging to Saudi Arabia, were bombed near the United Arab Emirates' Fujairah emirate, one of the world's largest bunkering hubs, located just outside the Strait of Hormuz. Washington has accused Iran's Revolutionary Guards of carrying out the attacks, and the Trump administration has declared a national security-related emergency that would clear the sale of billions of dollars' worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and other countries, bypassing congressional approval. Pakistan's relations with Iran have also been strained in recent months, with both sides accusing each other of not doing enough to stamp out militants allegedly sheltering across the border.

Naysa believes the seemingly mundane word that knocked her out the year before was just as intimidating, if not more. For the spellers who will gather starting Monday at a convention centre outside Washington for this year's bee, an unremarkable sound is the cause of their angst, their sleepless nights, their lifelong memories of failure. It's the most common sound in the English language, represented in the dictionary by an upside-down ""e,"" a gray chunk of linguistic mortar. To the uninitiated, it sounds like ""Uh."" Spellers know it by its proper name: the schwa. ""It's the bane of every speller's existence,"" Naysa said. ""It's what we hate."" The schwa falls only on unstressed syllables. Any vowel can make the sound, and so can ""y."" Sometimes a schwa can show up where vowels fear to tread: Think of the second syllable of the word ""rhythm."" And only in English can a single sound be so versatile. ""It's why there are spelling bees in English and no other language,"" said Peter Sokolowski, a lexicographer at Merriam-Webster who attends the bee regularly. In Romance languages like French and Spanish, vowels are predictable. The same letters rarely make different sounds. Sokolowski cites the example of ""banana"" — in Spanish the three ""a'' sounds are identical, but in English, because the stress falls on the middle syllable, the first and third ""a'' sounds become schwas. And because English absorbs words from every language, words with obvious spellings in their native tongues can become mysterious. Linguistic experts like Sokolowski or ex-spellers like Scott Remer, who placed fourth in 2008 and later wrote a book, ""Words of Wisdom,"" to guide high-level spellers, can sense the unease provoked by an unfamiliar schwa. ""You can usually tell when they are testing the kids on the schwa and you can often tell when the kids are taken aback by it,"" said Remer, 25, who coaches spellers in addition to his day job at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""The vast majority of instances where kids misspell is due to the schwa."" Naysa, a 13-year-old from Frisco, Texas, who will be back for one last crack at the bee this year, got dinged out in seventh place two years ago by the word ""marasmus,"" which means a condition of chronic undernourishment. She went with an ""e'' for the first vowel. If the word were spelled that way, the pronunciation would be exactly the same. ""I knew the word. I knew the word. I had heard it before, I knew the definition of it, but I forgot that schwa in that second,"" Naysa said. For a while, she would wake up at night thinking about it. ""Over time, it will still hurt but you stop thinking about it as much, but when I think about it, it really, really bugs me, because it's obviously 'm-a,' "" Naysa said. ""How could I be so stupid?"" Spellers have a variety of techniques to deal with the schwa, but nothing is foolproof. Sylvie Lamontagne, a 16-year-old two-time finalist who is coaching five spellers in this year's bee, said she advises her students to start with the language of origin as they assess which vowel is most likely. ""Greek words have 'o,' Latin words have 'i,' but it doesn't always hold up and it adds another layer of confusion,"" Sylvie said. ""It's just kind of a mess."" Anisha Rao of Corona, California, who tied for 10th in last year's bee, said she deals with tricky schwas the old-fashioned way: rote memorisation. ""People don't like to talk about it,"" said Anisha, who's 13 and will compete again this year, ""but sometimes the best way is just to memorize the word."" Schwas can be even more confusing when Scripps, in the later rounds of the bee, digs into the dictionary for words with languages of origin that are obscure or unknown, or words that originated as trademarks. ""As a general rule, often trademarks and words from unknown languages that might look shorter, might look easier, are actually way hard,"" Sylvie said. ""You're sort of in the dark. You have to do what you can to put it together with very limited information."" The schwa is a big reason why, for all the talk about pre-bee favorites like Naysa, there are no sure things. For every Vanya Shivashankar, who in 2015 claimed a title that seemed preordained, there is a Karthik Nemmani, last year's previously unheralded champion who got in through the bee's new wild-card program. The wild cards, who pay their own way into the bee rather than winning regional competitions and earning sponsorships, are back this year, and the bee is bigger than ever with 565 competitors. The field is deep, too, with 11 spellers who made last year's prime-time finals returning. Naysa believes luck is a bigger factor than anyone realizes in the final rounds and bristles at the suggestion the title is hers to lose. Spellers believe they are competing not against each other, but Merriam-Webster's Unabridged dictionary, and somewhere in that volume is a maddening schwa for everyone. ""Elite spellers aren't truly guessing very often. They can usually make up the constituent parts of the word,"" Sokolowski said. ""When they take a long time, you can tell when a kid really knows and you can tell when a kid is guessing. ... It's rare, and it's kind of exciting.""

Earlier this month, the Sri Lankan Army chief said that some of the suicide bombers visited Kashmir and Kerala for ""some sorts of training"" or to ""make some more links"" with other foreign outfits. Nine suicide bombers carried out a series of devastating blasts that tore through three churches and as many luxury hotels on April 21, killing nearly 260 people and injuring 500 others. Hardline Buddhist monk Galagodaatte Gnanasara, speaking to reporters on Friday, said that two Tamil Nadu Thowheeth Jamaath (TNTJ) men -- Ayub and Abdeen -- visited Sri Lanka. ""They met one Abdul Razik here. The idea was to provoke Buddhists to attack Muslims. They spread stories derogatory of the Buddha,"" Gnanasara said. The hardline Buddhist monk was addressing the media for the first time since President Maithripala Sirisena ordered his release using a presidential pardon. He was sentenced to six year imprisonment for contempt of court in August last year. Due to Sirisena's pardon, he was released from the jail after spending nine months behind bars. ""The TNTJ created Sri Lanka Thowheed Jamath (SLTJ) and later All Ceylon Thowheeth Jama'ath. The SLTJ was later split under nine separate leaders,"" Gnanasara said. He said that despite the arrest of almost everyone connected to the NTJ, another key figure Abdul Razik is still at large. ""This Razik is misleading the security forces. We will locate him soon,"" he said. The TNTJ, in a statement issued last month, denied any links with the NTJ and said that both the TNTJ and the SLTJ have been involved in social service and have been campaigning against terrorist organisations. Gnanasara became notorious for his anti-Muslim stance. In 2013, he was blamed for leading a major anti-Muslim riot in the Muslim-dominated town of Aluthgama in the Western Province. Since the Easter Sunday attacks, Gnanasara's prophecy on rising Muslim militancy gained credibility. He had publicly claimed many years ago that the NTJ was grouping for terror attacks. He was sent to jail for the contempt of court. His 19-year term was commuted to a 6-year concurrent sentence. Sirisena's decision to release him has triggered widespread criticism by religious minority and rights groups. Sri Lanka has banned the NTJ and arrested over 100 people in connection with the blasts.

Speaking to a Vatican-sponsored anti-abortion conference, Francis said the opposition to abortion isn't a religious issue but a human one. ""Is it licit to throw away a life to resolve a problem?'' he asked. ""Is it licit to hire a hitman to resolve a problem?'' Francis denounced decisions to abort based on prenatal testing, saying a human being is ""never incompatible with life.'' Even those babies destined to die at birth or soon thereafter deserve to receive medical care in the womb, Francis said, adding that their parents need to be supported so they don't feel isolated and afraid. While one can argue about using medical resources this way, there is value to it for the parents, he said. ""Taking care of these children helps parents to grieve and not only think of it as a loss, but as a step on a path taken together,"" Francis said. Francis has spoken out strongly against abortion but also has expressed sympathy for women who have had them and made it easier for them to be absolved of the sin of abortion. His comments come as the abortion debate is again making headlines in the US with state initiatives seeking to restrict the procedure.

Attahullah Khogyani, the provincial governor's spokesman, said 10 insurgents were also killed in the Friday night attack in Sherzad district. The civilians' vehicle was exiting the area right after the raid and security forces thought that Taliban fighters were trying to escape, so they opened fire and mistakenly killed the civilians, Khogyani said. Ajmal Omer, a provincial councilman, said villagers carrying the victims' bodies in a procession in the provincial capital of Jalalabad demanded justice for the victims' families. Both Taliban and Islamic State group fighters are active in eastern Afghanistan, especially in Nangarhar. The UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) said Saturday it was concerned about the heavy toll on civilians in the conflict during the holy month of Ramadan, and urged parties to do more to prevent casualties. It condemned the insurgents for incidents in which civilians have been deliberately targeted and said that during the first week of Ramadan, the Taliban killed six civilians and wounded 28 others in a premeditated attack against a non-governmental organization in Kabul. The statement said the UN mission is looking into the attack inside a mosque in the capital of Kabul during Friday prayers. Two people, including the prayer leader, were killed and 16 others were wounded. ""Deliberate and indiscriminate attacks against civilians can never be justified and amount to war crimes,'' said Tadamichi Yamamoto, the Secretary-General's special representative for Afghanistan. ``An attack in a mosque, especially at a time of prayer during Ramadan, is particularly heinous,'' Yamamoto was quoted in the statement. The UN mission said recent airstrikes against anti-government targets in southern Helmand and eastern Kunar provinces killed as many as 14 civilians. In the May 20 and 22nd attacks in the Greshk district of Helmand and the Chawki district of Kunar, the civilians killed included four women and eight children, and 12 other civilians were wounded, the UN said. Meanwhile, the Taliban claimed responsibility for Friday's attack on an armored vehicle belonging to Romanian NATO forces at Kandahar air base. Five Romanian NATO soldiers were injured. Separately, Col. Dave Butler, U.S. Forces Afghanistan spokesman, said a NATO helicopter had a hard landing due to mechanical failure in southern Helmand province. ""There was no hostile fire or enemy contact involved,'' he said in a statement. Both Afghan and US personnel were injured but were all in stable condition and expected to recover, he said. He said the aircraft was destroyed. Taliban insurgents are active in Helmand and control several districts in the province.

The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea issued its order at its Hamburg headquarters following a hearing earlier this month. Russia stayed away from both the hearing and Saturday's session. The confrontation in the Kerch Strait, which links the Sea of Azov with the Black Sea, marked a flashpoint in the simmering conflict over Russia's 2014 annexation of the Crimean Peninsula. Russia seized Crimea in a move that Ukraine and most of the world view as illegal but which gives Russia a much bigger shoreline along the Black Sea. The Kerch Strait separates Crimea from mainland Russia. Russia, which did submit a memorandum to the tribunal, had argued that the rights Ukraine claims in the case don't apply because they are covered by an exception for military activity. Kiev's lawyers contest this claim, saying Russia itself has previously described the arrest as a law enforcement operation. The tribunal sided with Ukraine's argument on that point. However, tribunal President Jin-Hyun Paik said ``the tribunal considers it appropriate to order both parties to refrain from taking any action which might aggravate or extend the dispute.'' He said Russia must return the ships to Ukrainian custody and allow the servicemen to go home. But the tribunal ``does not consider it necessary to require (Russia) to suspend criminal proceedings against the 24 detained Ukrainian servicemen and refrain from initiating new proceedings,'' he added. Kiev had called for legal proceedings to be ended. The tribunal's decisions are legally binding, but it has no power to enforce them. It called for both sides to report back on their compliance by June 25. Paik said Russia ``was given ample opportunity to present its observations'' in the case. The tribunal made its decision by a 19-1 vote, with a Russian judge dissenting. Olena Zerkal, Ukraine's deputy foreign minister for European integration, said on Facebook: ""We expect that Russia will quickly and fully fulfill the tribunal's order.'' In a statement, the Russian Foreign Ministry didn't address the details of the order but underlined its argument that the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea's dispute resolution procedures can't be applied to this dispute. In subsequent arbitration proceedings at the tribunal, ``we intend to consistently defend our position, including the lack of jurisdiction,'' it said.

Former Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, 80, was named speaker after the session voted 258-235 in favour of his nomination. Chuan came up against another candidate who was backed by more liberal parties. Backroom politicking appeared to be behind a motion by the pro-military Palang Pracharath Party to postpone the vote to select a house speaker. The motion failed narrowly and the votes faced complications because the session was held in a temporary site without automated facilities. The military-backed Palang Pracharath party is tipped to lead a government expected to be formed in the next few weeks and headed by the junta leader, Prayuth Chan-ocha, who staged a coup five years ago and has served as prime minister since then. Chuan's nomination as speaker came from a member of Palang Pracharath, and his successful appointment further cements Prayuth's chances to again become prime minister. The vote for prime minister is jointly taken by both the 500-member lower house, which is now led by Chuan, and Prayuth already has the solid support of the Senate, whose 250 members he helped appoint. Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, leader of the anti-military Future Forward Party, was earlier ordered out of the Saturday session, in line with a court suspension for allegedly breaking election rules. He spoke briefly to acknowledge his expulsion but his attempt to address the assembly drew loud and vehement protests from pro-military lawmakers. Thanathorn pressed on before leaving to a sustained standing ovation from his party members. The applause continued, despite the acting speaker telling them to stop. ""Enough,"" said acting house speaker Chai Chidchob, ""this isn't a theater. Stop."" The suspension of Thanathorn was widely seen as a further move to weaken anti-military opposition. The newly formed Future Forward party came from nowhere to become the third largest in the lower house. Its progressive agenda, which includes ending conscription and curbing the military's role in politics, has rattled Thailand's traditional ruling elite. In the coming weeks, the country's Constitutional Court is expected to decide whether to turn Thanathorn's suspension into a disqualification. The court, like the army, is widely seen as being close to the country's conservative power brokers.

Ramaphosa, 66, swore allegiance to the Constitution in the presence of thousands of dignitaries and citizens at Loftus Versfeld Stadium in the capital, Pretoria - after being voted unopposed in a process overseen by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng as the country's leader in the National Assembly this week. Several heads of state, former heads of state and heads of international and regional organisation attended the swearing in ceremony. It is the first time that a President's inauguration was open to the public and not just invited guests. The ANC, facing factionalism and public outcries about inaction against senior officials accused of corruption, won the May 8 general election but its share of the vote fell. The ANC secured 57.5 per cent of the parliamentary vote, while the main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), also saw its vote share fall. The ANC's seats in the 400-member parliament fell to 230 from 249. The main opposition DA also saw its number of seats fall to 84 from 89, while the leftist Economic Freedom Fighters gained 19 seats to 44. The South Africa Constitution requires voters to choose a party, which then selects members to go to the National Assembly, where they choose the President. It was the sixth general elections since anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela was elected the first democratic president of the country. Ramaphosa first took office last year after former president Jacob Zuma resigned amid corruption scandals. After taking the oath of office, Ramaphosa said, ""Today, we reaffirm our determination to work with our sisters and brothers across the continent to realise the African Union's vision of Agenda 2063. To build the Africa that we all Africans want."" He called for an efficient, capable and ethical state, a state that is free from corruption, for companies that generate social value and propel human development, for elected officials and public servants who faithfully serve no other cause than that of the public. He called for building a ""truly non-racial society, one that belongs to all South Africans, and in which all South Africans belong."" ""Africa is poised once again to rise, to assume its place among the free and equal nations of the world. We must use that innovative talent that originated in Africa to embrace and use the fourth Industrial Revolution to develop Africa and create jobs for the youth and empower the women of our continent,"" he said. Ramaphosa, a former trade union leader, played an instrumental role in negotiations which led to a transition of power from the white minority apartheid government that ruled the country for decades. He was a successful businessman before re-entering the political arena. Ramaphosa is expected to announce his new Cabinet on Sunday, with great expectations that it will not include a number of long-serving ministers in the previous Cabinet who are facing serious allegations of corruption. Two of those ministers -- Nomvula Mokonyane and Malusi Gigaba -- decided to withdraw from being named as Members of Parliament by the African National Congress (ANC) shortly before all members were sworn in before voting for the President. Ahead of the election, Ramaphosa apologised to South Africans for the political turmoil. He also vowed to continue the fight against graft that has hurt the country's economy.

Shenzhen-headquartered Huawei, a rapidly expanding leader in 5G technology, buys about $67 billion worth of components each year, including about $11 billion from the US suppliers, according to estimates. The world's two largest economies are locked in a trade war since Trump imposed heavy tariffs on imported steel and aluminium items from China in March last year. In response, China imposed tit-for-tat tariffs on billions of dollars worth of American imports. Escalating the trade tension, Trump signed an executive order on May 15 barring American companies from installing the foreign-made telecom equipment posing a national security threat, a move apparently aimed at banning Huawei from US networks. ""There's a possibility (of including Huawei in the trade deal). I think probably a good possibility,"" Trump told reporters at the White House responding to a question on the status of negotiations with China and Huawei. The United States is ""very concerned"" about Huawei from a security standpoint, he said. ""I don't know how China can do this because I'll be honest, we are getting hundreds of millions of dollars brought into our country. We've never gotten $0.10. We are getting hundreds of billions of dollars coming into our country,"" he said. On Thursday, Trump announced that he has directed his agriculture secretary to provide $16 billion in assistance to America's farmers and ranchers. ""It all comes from China,"" he said. ""We will be taking in, over a period of time, hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs and charges to China and our farmers will be greatly helped. We want to get them back to the point where they would have had if they had a good year. This support for farmers will be paid for by the billions of dollars our treasury takes in,"" he said. Months of negotiations on a trade deal broke recently after China, the US alleged, went back on its commitment. ""Not so long ago during the time of our negotiation and China broke the deal with us... that's fine but during that time of negotiation if everyone remembers we had periods where China would target our farms, right? They would actually target. ""They took an ad in a newspaper from Iowa, a big ad, said lots of bad things about the administration, about the fact that we are negotiating to tough, we are not going to make a deal. But they steal intellectual property by the billions. Somebody estimated it at $300 billion,"" he alleged. Trump said he cannot let that happen. The US economy is booming, the country is prospering and now is the time to insist on fair and reciprocal trade for US workers and farmers, he said. At the same time, he remained hopeful that the trade deal with China could happen soon. ""If it happens, great. If it doesn't happen that's fine. That's absolutely fine. And I look forward -- I will be seeing President Xi at the G20 very shortly,"" he said. ""In the meantime and may be for a long time I appreciate the incredible bipartisan support that my administration has had on trade and trade policy especially as it pertains to placing very massive tariffs on China,"" he said adding that these tariffs are paid for largely by China. ""China subsidises a lot of businesses and China came out and in subsidising the business they pay for a big portion of that tax. But right now a lot of companies are moving out of China because of the tax. They are moving to non-tariff countries. So it's a bad thing for China. We don't want that but that's just the way it works out,"" Trump said. Trump has been demanding that China reduce the massive trade deficit which last year climbed to over $539 billion. He is also pressing for verifiable measures for protection of intellectual property rights (IPR), technology transfer and more access to American goods to Chinese markets.

If given the green light, Adani could begin breaking ground at its Carmichael mine site within weeks, after more than eight years of planning. Adani group entered Australia in 2010 with the purchase of the greenfield Carmichael coal mine in the Galilee Basin in central Queensland, and the Abbot Point port near Bowen in the north. The massive coal mine in Queensland state has been a controversial topic, with the project expected to produce 2.3 billion tonnes of low-quality coal. In addition to its impact on climate change, environmentalists have argued the mine could do serious damage to Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area. Another major concern about the environmental impacts of the proposed mine has been that it would wipe out the most important habitat of the threatened black-throated finch.

According to media reports, Palaszczuk said the black-throated finch plan decision is due by the May 31, the groundwater management plan decision is due by the June 13th this year. ""I know initially people thought this was months, and what I'm announcing today is it's in a matter of weeks,"" she said in Cairns. ""Everybody needs to have these issues resolved. That's the timeframe the Coordinator General has set,"" she added. Earlier this week, Palascczuk ordered the state's Coordinator-General to bring Adani and the state environmental authority together for discussions stating that she was 'fed up' with the ongoing delays. While the post the final approval, the mining giant could start the work on the mine within weeks the coal exports could take up to two years. ""Now it's really a case for the independent regulator to work through their internal processes and then they can make a determination and then we will be in a position to then start construction,'' ABC news quoted Chief Executive of Adani Australia Lucas Dow as saying. ""We're not expecting any significant surprises. Our construction activity will start as almost immediately as we've got these approvals,"" he said. Dow said over the past 18 months the company had so far produced 11 versions of its groundwater plan and seven for the black-throated finch. The groundwater management plan has failed to meet key environmental requirements, including identifying the source of protected desert springs. Last month, the Federal Government granted its final environmental approvals for the project days before the election was called. While construction at the mine could begin with approvals, Adani's proposed railway line plan is yet to be finalised. Dow said the state's Coordinator-General would also be publishing dates for other key activities, including the deadline of completion for the rail line's deed of access and required sublease. ""That will also give us certainty and will also give the folks of central Queensland certainty of our project being able to proceed and deliver those jobs,"" he said.

May said she will quit as head of the governing party on June 7 but stay as caretaker prime minister until the new leader is chosen, a process the Conservatives aim to complete by late July. The new Conservative leader will become prime minister without the need for a general election, and will take up the task of trying to secure Britain's exit from the EU. May, who has been battling to unite her fractious party ever since she took the helm almost three years ago, said ``I have done my best.'' But she conceded that had not been enough. Her voice breaking, May said in a televised statement outside 10 Downing St. that she would soon be leaving a job that it has been ""the honor of my life to hold.'' May became prime minister the month after the UK voted in June 2016 to leave the European Union, and her premiership has been consumed by the attempt to deliver on that verdict. May spent more than a year and a half negotiating an exit agreement with the EU, only to see it rejected three times by Britain's Parliament. Many Conservative lawmakers came to see May as the main obstacle to leaving the bloc, although her replacement will face the same issue: a Parliament deeply divided over whether to exit the EU, and how close a relationship to seek with Europe after it does. Now she has quit over her failure to take Britain out of the EU on the scheduled date of March 29. Britain is currently due to leave the EU on October 31, but Parliament has yet to approve divorce terms. ""I negotiated the terms of our exit and a new relationship with our closest neighbors that protects jobs, our security and our Union,'' May said. ""I have done everything I can to convince MPs to back that deal. Sadly, I have not been able to do so.'' ""It is now clear to me that it is in the best interests of the country for a new prime minister to lead that effort,'' she added. Multiple contenders are already jockeying to replace her and take up the challenge of securing Britain's EU exit. The early front-runner is Boris Johnson, a former foreign secretary and strong champion of Brexit. Pressure on May reached breaking point this week as House of Commons Leader Andrea Leadsomquit and several Cabinet colleagues expressed doubts about the bill she planned to put before Parliament in a fourth attempt to secure lawmakers' backing for her Brexit blueprint. Leadsom, another likely contender to replace May, joined colleagues in paying tribute to the departing leader. She tweeted that May's ""dignified speech'' had been ""an illustration of her total commitment to country and duty. She did her utmost, and I wish her all the very best.'' Johnson, whose relentless criticism helped push May out of the door, tweeted: ""Thank you for your stoical service to our country and the Conservative Party. It is now time to follow her urgings: to come together and deliver Brexit.'' But Johnson, or any other successor, will face a tough challenge to unite a country and a Parliament still deeply divided over the country's relationship with Europe. The next British leader is likely to be a staunch Brexiteer, who will try to renegotiate the divorce deal, and if that fails to leave the bloc without an agreement on departure terms. Most businesses and economists think that would cause economic turmoil and plunge Britain into recession. Parliament has voted to rule out a no-deal Brexit, though it remains the legal default option. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, an opponent of Brexit, tweeted that May's exit ``will not solve the Brexit mess that the Tories have created. ... The prospect of an even more hardline Brexiteer now becoming PM and threatening a no deal exit is deeply concerning.'' European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker praised May as ""a woman of courage'' for whom he has great respect. EU spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said Juncker would ""equally respect and establish working relations'' with any new British leader. But the bloc insists it will not renegotiate the Brexit deal. ""We have set out our position on the withdrawal agreement and on the political declaration,'' Andreeva said. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte tweeted that the ``agreement reached between the EU and the United Kingdom for an ordered Brexit remains on the table.'' Angela Merkel's spokeswoman, Martina Fietz, said the German chancellor noted May's decision ""with respect'' and would continue to work closely with her successor for ``an orderly exit.'' In an emotional departure speech, with close aides and her husband Philip looking on, May said ""I will shortly leave the job that it has been the honor of my life to hold - the second female prime minister but certainly not the last.'' ""I do so with no ill will, but with enormous and enduring gratitude to have had the opportunity to serve the country I love.''

The legal move is the latest step in what analysts say has been a months-long campaign by former General Prabowo Subianto to discredit the election. Members of his campaign including his brother, Hashim Djojohadikusumo, arrived Friday night at the Constitutional Court in Jakarta, where a large digital clock was counting down the time left for challenges to the election. The court has a month to make its judgment. Official results released Tuesday by the Election Commission showed President Joko Widodo won 55.5% of the votes in the April 17 poll, in line with preliminary counts on election day. Subianto, who also lost to Widodo in 2014, has declared himself the winner and alleged massive fraud but provided no credible evidence. The election supervisory agency earlier this week rejected Subianto's complaint about the election's integrity after evidence of vote rigging provided by his team consisted of printouts of online articles. Police say the 24 hours of rioting that started Tuesday night in Jakarta was orchestrated. Tens of thousands of police and soldiers remain on high alert in the capital.

The remarks by Mohammad Javad Zarif were the latest in a war of words between him and Trump. The Iranian diplomat on Friday assailed the American president for his tweet earlier this week warning Iran not to threaten the US again or it would face its ""official end.'' ""Iran will see the end of Trump, but he will never see the end of Iran,'' Zarif was quoted by Iran's semi-official Fars new agency as saying during a visit to Islamabad. Tensions have ratcheted up recently in the Mideast as the White House earlier this month sent an aircraft carrier and B-52 bombers to the region over a still-unexplained threat it perceived from Iran. And on Thursday, the Pentagon outlined proposals to the White House to send military reinforcements to the Middle East to beef up defenses against Iran. The purpose of Zarif's visit to Pakistan, where he held talks with his Pakistani counterpart Shah Mehmood Qureshi and also Prime Minister Imran Khan, was not made public. But there has been speculation that Iran is looking to Islamabad and its close relationship with Riyadh to help de-escalate the situation. Ahead of Zarif's arrival, Pakistan's foreign ministry called on ""all sides to show restraint, as any miscalculated move, can transmute into a large-scale conflict.'' Zarif has been criticized this week by Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who named him and President Hassan Rouhani as failing to implement the leader's orders over Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Khamenei had claimed the deal had ""numerous ambiguities and structural weaknesses'' that could damage Iran. Separately, the official Iranian news agency IRNA quoted Zarif in Islamabad as warning of anarchy if world powers don't unite to stop what he called US aggression, Iran's official parlance for Washington's pressure on Tehran. The crisis takes root in the steady unraveling of the nuclear deal, intended to keep Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. The accord promised economic incentives in exchange for restrictions on Tehran's nuclear activities. The Trump administration pulled America out of the deal last year, and subsequently re-imposed and escalated US sanctions on Tehran sending Iran's economy into freefall. Khamenei's criticism of Zarif signaled a hard-line tilt in how the Islamic Republic will react going forward amid President Donald Trump's maximalist pressure campaign. Iran declared earlier this month that the remaining signatories to the deal Germany, France, Britain, China and Russia have two months to develop a plan to shield Iran from American sanctions. On Monday, Iran announced it had quadrupled its production capacity of low-enriched uranium, making it likely that Tehran will soon exceed the stockpile limitations set by the nuclear accord, which would escalate the situation further. Several incidents have added to the crisis. On Thursday, Saudi Arabia said Yemen's Iran-aligned rebels again targeted an airport near its southern border with a bomb-carrying drone. The Saudi military said it intercepted the drone, while the rebel Houthis said it struck a Patriot missile battery at the airport. The Houthis have claimed three times in recent days to have targeted the airport, which also hosts a military base. It comes after the Houthis last week targeted a Saudi oil pipeline in a coordinated drone attack. Pakistan was quick to condemn the attacks and promised Saudi Arabia, a staunch ally, its full support. The kingdom this week announced a $3.2 billion deferred oil and gas payment package for energy-strapped Islamabad. With neighboring Iran, Pakistan walks a fine line and their relationship is sometimes prickly. Islamabad has little leverage with Washington, although relations between the two have improved since Pakistan expressed readiness to help move talks between the Afghan Taliban and Washington forward. IRNA also reported that Zarif came to Pakistan with a proposal to link Iran's port of Chabahar on the Arabian Sea with Pakistan's Gwadar port, mostly being developed by China as part of the multi-billion-dollar One Road project that will connect the Arabian Sea with China. The proposal is unexpected because Pakistan's rival India has been Iran's partner in developing Chabahar while Iran's key regional rival, Saudi Arabia, has been in talks to develop an oil refinery facility at Pakistan's Gwadar, though no agreements have been signed. Meanwhile, Oman's Foreign Ministry said it was working to ``ease the tensions'' between Iran and the US. The ministry in a series of tweets on Friday morning attributed the comments to Yusuf bin Alawi, the sultanate's minister of state for foreign affairs, and cited an interview in Asharq Al-Wasat, the London-based newspaper owned by a Saudi media group long associated with the Al Saud royal family. In the interview, bin Alawi warns war ""could harm the entire world if it breaks out.'' He doesn't confirm any current Omani mediation but says both the US and Iran realize the gravity of the situation. Oman's Sultan Qaboos bin Said spoke last week by telephone with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Oman, a nation on the eastern edge of the Arabian Peninsula, has long been an interlocutor of the West with Iran. The US held secret talks in Oman with the Iranians that gave birth to the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.

The recycled Falcon rocket blasted off late Thursday night. The first-stage booster landed on an ocean platform following liftoff, as the tightly packed cluster of satellites continued upward. Musk said Friday all 60 flat-panel satellites were deployed and online a few hundred miles (kilometers) above Earth. Each weighs 500 pounds (227 kilograms) and has a single solar panel and a krypton-powered thruster for raising and maintaining altitude. The satellites have the capability of automatically dodging sizable pieces of space junk. The orbiting constellation — named Starlink — will grow in the next few years, Musk said. Twelve launches of 60 satellites each will provide reliable and affordable internet coverage throughout the US, he said. Twenty-four launches will serve most of the populated world and 30 launches the entire world. That will be 1,800 satellites in total, with more planned after that. Musk told reporters last week there's ""a fundamental goodness"" to giving people in all corners of the globe choices in broadband internet service. He's especially interested in reaching areas without coverage or where it is expensive or unreliable. Other companies have similar plans, including Project Kuiper from Jeff Bezos' Amazon and OneWeb. According to Musk, California-based SpaceX can use Starlink revenue to develop more advanced rockets and spacecraft to achieve his ultimate goal of establishing a city on Mars. Musk, who also runs the electric carmaker Tesla and other ventures, said Starlink is one of the hardest engineering projects he's encountered. The satellites include a lot of new technology, and he warned last week that some of them might not work. The Starlink satellites are designed to re-enter the atmosphere after four or five years in orbit, burning up harmlessly over the Pacific. Musk stressed there will be no safety issues on the ground from falling chunks of debris. The launch was delayed twice last week, first by high wind and then for software updates. It was the third flight for this booster.

Representatives of the country's security apparatus had told the foreign envoys that the law would be enforced to its fullest extent on those who stir up incidents of extremism in the country, the Prime Minister's office said in a statement.

In an increasingly bitter exchange that has brought traditional American bipartisanship to a standstill, Pelosi, 78, suggested Trump, 72, is unstable and said she wished that “his family or his administration or his staff would have an intervention for the good of the country.” The barb came after Trump reportedly stormed out of a meeting to discuss infrastructure because he was miffed Democrats prefaced the meeting with allegations that he was engaged in a cover-up relating to the Russia probe. He said he would work with the Democrat-majority Congress only if it ended investigations into what he regards as the “Russia hoax.” The alleged tantrum, which Trump denied and got his factotums to back up saying he was very calm, led to Pelosi needling him and suggesting “maybe he wants to take a leave of absence.” She said she is worried about his well-being. The suggestion that he was mentally ill enraged Trump, who struck back on Thursday, calling Pelosi “crazy.” 'I'll tell you what, I've been watching her, and I have been watching her for a long period of time, she's not the same person. She's lost it,' Trump said at an event with farmers and ranchers at the White House. 'I think she's got a lot of problems.' 'She was all crazy yesterday. She is a mess…she’s disintegrating,” Trump added, repeating his insistence that he is an “extremely stable genius.” 'When the 'extremely stable genius' starts acting more presidential, I'll be happy to work with him on infrastructure, trade and other issues,' Pelosi shot back on Twitter. The spat got uglier after Trump and his acolytes began distributing videos, some of them doctored, showing Pelosi slurring words and stammering, with the implication that she has a drinking problem (she is reportedly a teetotaler). “We repeat, we wish that his family or his Administration or his staff would have an intervention for the good of the country,” Pelosi shot back on Twitter. The poisonous exchanges came amid mounting pressure in the Democratic Party to launch impeachment proceedings against Trump, which Pelosi is resisting with the argument that it could help Trump in the run up to 2020. Trump meanwhile hit back by launching a counter-investigation into those who investigated his 2016 campaign. In what is widely seen as a political counter attack, the U.S President gave his Attorney General William Barr sweeping new authorities to conduct a review into how the 2016 Trump campaign’s ties to Russia were investigated, while directing C.I.A. and the country’s 15 other intelligence agencies to cooperate with the review. Trump also gave Barr “full and complete authority” to declassify government secrets relating to the investigation, asserting “Today’s action will ensure that all Americans learn the truth about the events that occurred, and the actions that were taken, during the last Presidential election and will restore confidence in our public institutions.” Trump’s decision was greeted with alarm in some quarters. “Make no mistake: If Barr discloses the identities of CIA and CI (counter-intelligence) sources providing information on Russia he is disabling our intelligence capacities to Russia’s advantage,” warned Asha Rangappa, a former FBI special agent and counter intelligence specialist, cautioning that the move “puts sources providing intelligence in danger and cripples the ICs ability to recruit new sources.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."|"Meltdown in US polity as Trump, Pelosi accuse each other of being mentally ill"|"Fri May 24 21:40:00 CEST 2019"|"[world]"

Surprisingly the anti-Modi sting in the media was missing as for many outlets it was not an unexpected outcome of the elections. There was also no use in regular reporting of threat to Muslims and minorities by Modi or his BJP. However, analysis and editorial did highlight such threats. The element of in-depth coverage of elections followed by deep analysis was missing as almost all papers and other media outlets were dependent on news agencies in absence of dedicated reporting teams in India. Dawn in a front page report wrote that Modi won an emphatic mandate in general elections that saw him pitching national security as an invincible talisman. ""In projecting himself as the choreographer of air raids on Balakot across the border, Mr Modi severely bruised a fractious and unequal opposition,"" according to the paper. The next government in New Delhi will determine the course of Indo-Pakistan ties, which were pushed to a new low after the Pulwama terror attack. During the campaign, Modi harped on national security issues, including a counter-terror operation carried out at the biggest JeM training camp in Pakistan's Balakot. Dawn wrote a scathing editorial about the success of Modi, terming it a victory of communal politics. ""For the world's largest democracy, the writing is on the wall: communal politics in India has triumphed in an age that will define the future of the republic,"" it worte. It wrote that the ""results are astounding, and depressingly show that religious hatred and sectarian politics can be exploited to lure voters"". ""Notably, the months leading up to Mr Modi's campaign were marked by anti-Muslim and anti-Pakistan rants, with India going so far as to escalate tensions by conducting air strikes inside Pakistan in order to whip up nationalist sentiment,"" it opined. The News International termed Modi's win as ""dramatic"" but added that it was only a reflection of global trend. ""His re-election reinforces a global trend of right-wing populists sweeping to victory, from the United States to Brazil and Italy, often after adopting harsh positions on protectionism, immigration and defence,"" according to the report. However, an analytical article by Aijaz Zaka Syed appeared in The News International credited Modi for the victory of the BJP. ""If the BJP and Modi have won this election, they perhaps deserved to win. They put in a great deal of hard work and have had the hunger to win,"" he wrote. He also said that Modi could be responsible for many sins but the Opposition failed to expose his failures.

The Nation in the main story highlighted that Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan congratulated Modi on his victory. The electronic media was also not overtly involved in the results coverage and seldom stopped routine reporting to give breaking news and alerts about the Indian election results. However, some of the evening TV talk shows pondered over the questions regarding impact of Modi on India's relations with Pakistan. Special advisor to Prime Minister on information Firdous Ashiq Awan told Hamid Mir of Geo news in his talk show on Thursday night that ""victory of Modi is neither a bad news for Pakistan nor a good news"". ""We want to engage with India and resolve all difference through talks. For us there is no difference who is leading India,"" she said. Foreign Office spokesman Mohammad Faisal to a question about elections in India said Pakistan consistently maintained that the only way to resolve all outstanding issues, including the issue of Jammu and Kashmir is through implementation of UNSC resolutions. ""Dialogue is hence essential. We remain committed to the same, irrespective of whoever forms the new Government in India,"" he said.

The blast, triggered through an Improvised Explosive Device (IED), targeted the Rehmania Mosque in Pashtunabad area of the provincial capital Quetta, they said. No group has claimed responsibility of the attack. ""Three people, including the prayer leader, died in the blast while 28 other worshipers were injured,"" Balochistan Deputy Inspector General of Police Abdul Razzaq Cheema said, adding the blast occurred just before the Friday prayers started. The injured were shifted to Civil Hospital Quetta. President Dr Arif Alvi and Prime Minister Imran Khan condemned the terrorist attack in Quetta. Alvi expressed deep grief and sorrow over the loss of precious lives and prayed for the early recuperation of those injured in the incident. Prime Minister Khan directed the authorities concerned to provide best medical treatment facilities to them. A security official said that the death toll could rise as it was a powerful explosion. Balochistan chief minister Jam Kamal Khan Alyani condemned the blast and summoned a report on the incident. He expressed grief over the deaths and multiple injuries caused by the blast. The blast came days after terrorists attacked the Pearl Continental luxury hotel in the port city of Gwadar in Balochistan, killing at least eight persons, including four civilians and a Pakistan Navy soldier. Balochistan, which borders Afghanistan and Iran, is Pakistan's largest and poorest province, rife with ethnic, sectarian and separatist insurgencies. At least 20 people were killed and 48 others injured last month in a blast at a fruit and vegetable market in Quetta's Hazarganji area. The attack was claimed by the ISIS terror group. On April 18, unidentified gunmen donning uniforms of paramilitary soldiers massacred at least 14 passengers, including Pakistan Navy personnel, after forcing them to disembark from buses on a highway in Balochistan. China is investing heavily in Balochistan under the USD 60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). The CPEC, launched in 2015, is a planned network of roads, railways and energy projects linking China's resource-rich Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region with Pakistan's strategic Gwadar Port on the Arabian Sea.

Historically, the Liberal-National Coalition’s policies have been perceived as being more immigration friendly. Opposition Labour Party’s proposed hard-line approach would have made it more expensive to hire migrants, even for meeting skill shortages. This spells good news for Indians aspiring to work in Australia. Nearly, 33,000 odd Indians (including family members) had migrated to Australia for work during the year ended June, 2018, making India the largest source country. “If the Labour Party had come to power, it would have increased the annual ‘threshold’ wages for migrants, covered by the Temporary Skilled Shortage (TSS) visa, from AUD 54,000 to AUD 65,000 in the hope that it would scare off many Australian employers seeking to hire migrants at the lower end of the wage-spectrum,” Cyrus Mistry, the Perth -based director of EasyMigrate Consultancy Services, told TOI. “There were significant and valid concerns about the prospective changes that the Labour party would implement, including the proposed doubling of the ‘Skilling Australians Fund’ levy,” points out Dan Engles, managing director at Visa Solutions Australia in a client news-update. Currently, Australian employers sponsoring migrants for the TSS visa contribute to a government fund — a sum ranging between AUD 1,200-1,800 per year — depending on the size of their business operations. The Labour Party had proposed to significantly raise this contribution amount. TOI, in its edition of April 1, had covered the announcement made by the Morrison government that it was reducing the migration cap by 15% (this does not include student visas), which would limit migrant flow to 1.60 lakh for the fiscal year commencing from July 1. However, the government has also sought to incentivise new migrants to settle outside the already congested big cities, by introducing two classes of ‘Regional (Provisional) visas’ from November 2019, which offer quicker processing and an option for the visa holder to opt for permanent residency at a later stage. “I believe this cut in migration cap will stay. However, the Morrison government had begun to push towards ‘employer-sponsored migration’ to ensure that migrants fill skill shortages. More of the DAMA (Designated Area) Agreements are being finalised, more regions are being covered... These will ensure that regional skill shortages will be effectively met. Australia will also continue to be marketed as a destination for international students,” stated Mistry. On the flip side, the Labour Party had more favourable policies for the ‘Parent-Visitors’ visa, he added.

"69453208"|"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/shinzo-abe-thats-not-his-name-says-japans-foreign-minister/articleshow/69453208.cms"|"[New York Times]"|"TOKYO: By now, President Donald Trump and Japan’s prime minister are on a first-name basis. But that could soon become more complicated. In Japan, a first name means something different: The Japanese refer to themselves with the surname first, then the given name. And Japan’s foreign minister says it is time for the Western world to respect his country’s tradition and render Japanese names in that order in English. So the man Westerners know as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe would be called Abe Shinzo. The foreign minister, Taro Kono (or Kono Taro, if you please), issued his request to foreign media outlets during a news conference on Tuesday. “As many news organizations write Chinese President Xi Jinping and South Korean President Moon Jae-in,” Kono said, noting that the surname-first template was followed for other Asian leaders, “it is desirable for Prime Minister Abe Shinzo’s name to be written in a similar manner.” Since opening to the West a century and a half ago, the Japanese have accepted that Westerners would refer to them not as they refer to themselves — surname first, then given name — but in reverse order. On their business cards — the exchange of which is a crucial part of commercial etiquette — many in Japan have their name printed surname first in Japanese on one side and given-name first in English on the other. But Kono suggested it would be a good time for news organizations to rethink their practices, because Trump is scheduled to arrive in Tokyo on Saturday for a state visit, and a Group of 20 summit will be held in Osaka next month. The Summer Olympics will also be held in Tokyo next year, and Kono said that the names of Japanese athletes should appear surname-first in video footage, just as the names of athletes from China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea and North Korea do. The foreign minister’s request comes at a time when the Japanese government is simultaneously nurturing a revival of nationalism and spearheading an effort to draw in more foreigners as the native Japanese population wanes. Abe is strongly supported by the far right wing of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, which hews to tradition and tends toward insularity. But he has prioritized foreign policy and worked to elevate Japan as an international leader, and he has also nudged the country toward more openness, pushing the passage of a law late last year that authorized a sharp increase in the number of foreign workers who will be admitted to Japan. Globally minded Japanese say that as the United States under Trump re-evaluates its role as the champion of a democratic world order, Japan should not do anything that appears to be a retreat from the international community. “What I think is negative is a subliminal message that a change itself can send,” said Nobuko Kobayashi, a partner in Tokyo with the Japanese arm of Ernst & Young, the consulting firm. If Japan insists that Westerners revert to the traditional name-ordering convention, she said, some might view that as Japan “withdrawing from the Western world, and that is precisely not the message we want to send.” Kobayashi, who graduated from the elite Tokyo University and has a graduate degree from Harvard Business School, said that ever since Japan opened to the West in the 19th century, its people had become adept at incorporating Western customs. Reversing name order in different contexts is “a demonstration that Japanese culture is a flexible one,” she said. “As Japanese are comfortable using forks and knives when they eat Western food, they are also very comfortable using chopsticks” when they eat Japanese meals. It is not clear what Abe thinks of Kono’s proposal. He has not commented, although his chief Cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, told reporters that given the long-established practice of putting the surname last in Western contexts, “we need to consider many elements” before making a government recommendation. Japan’s education minister, Masahiko Shibayama, endorsed Kono’s proposal, which echoes a similar recommendation nearly two decades ago from the government’s National Language Council, which adjudicates various linguistic issues. Shortly after the advisory was issued in 2000, the Education Ministry overhauled textbooks for junior high school English-language classes, putting Japanese names in surname-first order. Foreign media, however, did not follow. On Twitter, some critics ribbed Shibayama, pointing out that his name was listed on the Education Ministry’s English-language website as “Masahiko Shibayama” — an example of the huge undertaking that would be required to institute the change across the government. Shibayama changed the order of his name Tuesday. Kumiko Torikai, a retired professor of English education and cross-cultural communication at Rikkyo University, said the historic adoption of the Western name order was “insulting” to Japanese tradition. “The major trend in the world is to accept a multicultural society,” Torikai said. “It’s normal that various cultures coexist and each should respect other cultures. I think it’s outdated just to copy Western countries.” In South Korea, the government issued official guidance before the 2012 London Olympics requesting that transliterations of its athletes’ names be rendered in the traditional cultural style of surname first. “Each Korean and each name of a Korean may seem like a small thing,” the guidance read, “but when they come together, they form the national image of the Republic of Korea.” However, even those who support the idea of respecting cultural naming tradition say it is not practical to reverse entrenched practices. “I do see the point in a way, but I think it’s also a futile exercise and likely to contribute to confusion,” said Koichi Nakano, a political scientist at Sophia University in Tokyo. “It’s naïve for the Japanese government to think that it can get the international media and beyond to switch overnight.” Some in the Japanese establishment say that Japan should not necessarily invoke China or South Korea. “I think we opened up rather earlier than them,” said Ichiro Fujisaki, a former Japanese ambassador to the United States, referring to Japan’s opening to the West with the arrival of the US Commodore Matthew Perry in 1853. Reversing the convention now, said Sachiko Ishikawa, who works as a translator in Tokyo, would be “taking a step backward in time.” Ishikawa, whose mother is German and father is Japanese, said she was concerned that the proposal was motivated more by politics than cultural respect. “In my opinion, there is an unnerving wave of nationalism growing in Japan — and to be honest, I think this is a small symptom of a much bigger problem,” Ishikawa said. “The world is shifting toward right-wing ideologies, so it’s obvious that this isn’t so much about how to write about PM Abe, but rather a sloppy way to establish their nationalistic sentiments and demands overseas.” Perhaps a hint of Abe’s views will emerge during Trump’s visit. When the American president came to Japan in November 2017, Abe gave him hats emblazoned with the slogan “Donald and Shinzo make alliance even greater.” If the hats say “Abe” this time, we’ll know.

He didn't just submit a couple of the devices — he delivered in person or shipped to Apple around 3,000 of them. Apple responded by sending almost 1,500 replacement iPhones, each with an approximate resale value of USD600. But the devices that Quan Jiang sent Apple were fake. Jiang, 30, a former engineering student at a community college in Albany, Oregon, pleaded guilty in federal court Wednesday to trafficking in counterfeit goods, the US Attorney's office in Portland announced. The presence of fake iPhones and other high-tech gadgets has become an issue in global resale markets, with some counterfeit versions operating so well it's hard for users to tell the difference between them and the genuine products. But in the Oregon case, the makers of the thousands of fake phones apparently didn't even have to bother with having working operating systems. An Apple official quoted by Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Thomas Duffy in a court document exposed a vulnerability that Jiang exploited. ""Submission of an iPhone that will not power on is critical to perpetuating iPhone warranty fraud, as the phone will not be able to be immediately examined or repaired by Apple technicians, triggering the Apple iPhone replacement process as part of its product warranty policy,"" Duffy wrote, quoting Apple brand protection representative Adrian Punderson. The US Attorney's office in Portland said Jiang would import the counterfeit devices from Hong Kong and submit them to Apple using various assumed names. The genuine replacement phones Jiang received would be sold in China. Jiang's associate would pay Jiang's mother, who lives in China, who then deposited the money into Jiang's bank account. Jiang received packages containing between 20 and 30 counterfeit iPhones from associates in Hong Kong between Jan 1, 2016, and Feb 1, 2018, according to court documents. Apple realised something was amiss as early as June 30, 2017, when its legal counsel sent Jiang a ""cease and desist"" letter to an address in Corvallis where 150 warranty claims emanated. The lawyers said the company knew he was importing counterfeit Apple products, according to Duffy's affidavit. Jiang didn't respond, so the Apple lawyers sent a second letter. Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the case. Apple rejected 1,576 warranty claims associated with Jiang, Duffy said. The 1,493 claims that resulted in replacement iPhones being delivered by Apple represented an $895,000 loss to the Cupertino, California-based company, Duffy wrote. Brad Bench, who heads the Homeland Security Investigations office in Seattle, said in a statement that trafficking in counterfeit goods hurts the economy, legitimate businesses, and impact consumers directly. Jiang faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, a $2 million fine or twice his proceeds, whichever is greater, when he is sentenced on Aug 28. Under a plea agreement, the US Attorney's office will recommend a prison sentence of three years, at least $200,000 in restitution to Apple. And Jiang must forfeit his black 2015 Mercedes-Benz CLA 250 coupe.

Under the headline, ""Narendra Modi, India's 'Watchman', Heads for Historic Election Victory,"" the New York Times noted that ""his brand of brawny Hindu nationalism and pro-business policies seem to have played stunningly well, despite concerns that he had not delivered on promises to create jobs."" ""Many Indians see Mr Modi as a nationalist icon. He has confronted China, nearly gone to war with Pakistan, and brought India closer to the US,"" it observed. However, President Trump, locked in a bitter domestic political battle with his Democrat opponents, had not sent out any message at the time of writing, his Twitter feed restricted to the political wrangle at home. It's possible the US establishment is waiting for the formal results. However, Prime Minister Modi will have an opportunity early in his second term to catch up with Trump, who likes winners and abhors ""losers,"" at the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan in late June. Although U.S business organizations and corporations have praised Modi as a business friendly leader and broadly welcomed his return to power, Trump has occasionally expressed disappointment at the outcome of US-India trade ties, saying there's not enough in it for the United States. The Wall Street Journal also noted that is ""less clear to investors and executives is which version of Mr. Modi would take charge: the business-friendly leader or the divisive nationalist,"" since the Prime Minister ""dropped pledges on economy and focused on nationalism to win votes of Hindu majority."" The Washington Post, in its report, said the landslide victory for Modi ""endorsed his vision of a muscular, assertive and stridently Hindu India,"" while noting that although he came up short on the economic front, ""Modi pushed a message of nationalist pride and told voters that he was the only candidate who would safeguard the country's security and combat terrorism."" Sundry think tanks have scheduled discussion on the outcome of the landmark elections, which the NYT noted had resulted in a commanding parliamentary majority for one party for a second time running, a feat not achieved in decades.

Two of three major state-owned carriers Air China Ltd and China Southern Airlines Ltd said on Wednesday they want compensation for their aircraft being grounded. The third, China Eastern Airlines Ltd, announced a similar request last month. China is, along with North America and Europe, one of the biggest markets for jetliners. That makes its response critical for Boeing. It was among the first countries to ground the 737 Max in March following crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed a total of 346 people. Investigators have suggested a flight-control system was to blame for both 737 Max crashes. ``We must use punishment and tell the Americans their practice of using concealment and fraud to extract benefits from others, while benefiting themselves, is unfair,'' said the Global Times newspaper, which is published by the ruling Communist Party and known for its nationalistic tone. Air China, which has 15 of the 737 Max jets, also wants compensation for delays in aircraft deliveries, an employee of its publicity department said. He declined to give his name or details of the claim. China Southern wants compensation for disruption due to being unable to use its 737 Max planes, said an employee of its publicity department. He would give only his surname, Wang. It's unclear how many flights have been disrupted. The country's aviation regulator said in April any changes in design or training will be ``fully evaluated'' based on the results of investigations into fatal 737 MAX crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. That suggested Beijing wants to examine and approve any changes instead of relying on Boeing or the US Federal Aviation Administration. China is one of nine countries represented on an FAA review panel, along with Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, Japan, Indonesia, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates. ""Let everyone participate to show you aren't cheating,"" said Guangcha.com, a news website. Boeing estimates Chinese carriers will buy 7,700 jetliners over the next two decades.

This is significant because China has been facing aggressive trade actions by the Trump administration. Beijing expects Indian support in crucial areas like allowing Huawei to operate at a time when it has been banned in the US. China’s recent decision to allow the naming of Pakistan-based Masood Azhar as a global terrorist at the United Nations Security Council is believed to have given the ruling BJP some added advantage in the elections. “In recent years, China-India relations have shown strong momentum of development under the joint efforts of both sides.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called it all ""very, very, very strange'"" and said she was praying for Trump and the nation. Trump tweeted his thanks for her prayers but said he would not proceed down two tracks investigation and legislation. Democrats said his ultimatum seemed scripted, with signs declaring his innocence already prepared for his outdoor remarks that followed. Yet Trump's unease with congressional oversight and talk of what he called the ""i-word'' impeachment now threatens to deprive him of legislative accomplishments for the remainder of his term. The scene playing out live on television was reminiscent of earlier ones at the White House, including during the federal government shutdown, when Trump walked out on Democrats. While this standoff could benefit him politically in the short term, with his tough talk stirring up supporters, it leaves his trade deals, a new budget and other goals in jeopardy as he heads into a re-election campaign. Democrats called it another Trump temper tantrum. ""I want to do infrastructure,'' Trump said he told Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, noting the scheduled topic of the meeting. ""But you know what? We can't do it under these circumstances,'' he said he told them. ``So get these phony investigations over."" Without ever shaking anyone's hand, or even taking a seat, Trump turned and left the three-minute meeting. He strode to the Rose Garden where reporters and TV cameras had been assembled and proceeded to assail the Democrats, particularly Pelosi for her comment earlier in the morning on Capitol Hill that she believed the president was engaged in a ``cover-up'' of the Russia probe. ""I don't do cover-ups,"" Trump fumed. Back on Capitol Hill, Pelosi said Trump ""just took a pass"" on working on national infrastructure problems. Flanked by Schumer and other House and Senate leaders, Pelosi said the Democrats had gone to the White House ``to give this president the opportunity to have a signature infrastructure initiative.'' The meeting had been set weeks ago, after Trump and the Democratic leaders agreed to talk further about a possible $2 trillion infrastructure proposal. Democrats have been working with the president's daughter Ivanka, and Trump was due to provide his ideas on how to pay for it. But he told them he couldn't engage on infrastructure because Pelosi said ``something terrible,'' according to an administration official and another person familiar with what happened in the room. Democrats said they doubted he actually was ever going to put forward a plan. Schumer who brought his own 35-page proposal to the meeting _ said that when Trump ``was forced to say how he would pay for it he had to run away.'' What started as a challenging day for Pelosi as she tries to tamp down growing calls for an impeachment inquiry swiftly turned, with the attention going back on the president. Even some Republicans noted the shift. ``In the end we've got work to do,'' said Sen. John Cornyn, who called the meeting dramatic. ``And I think the best thing we could do for the people we work for is to try to make progress where we can.'' Earlier Wednesday, House Democrats had convened for a closed-door meeting amid Trump's stonewalling of their investigators, as a growing number of the party's lawmakers say they want to open an impeachment inquiry. They say it's not necessarily aimed at removing the president from office but to bolster their position in court against his blocking their probes with broad claims of immunity. Rep Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York spoke up at the meeting, and some two dozen Democrats have signed on to the idea. With her leadership team, Pelosi, who has resisted pressure to impeach, suggested patience. She pointed rank-and-file Democrats toward the legal battles that she said have already found success i n forcing Trump to comply with investigations. ``We do believe it's important to follow the facts,'' Pelosi told reporters afterward. ``We believe that no one is above the law, including the president of the United States, and we believe that the president of the United States is engaged in a cover-up.'' A federal judge ruled Wednesday that the White House cannot block subpoenas for Trump's financial records from Deutsche Bank, which has lent his real estate company millions of dollars. On Monday a federal judge also ruled against Trump in a separate financial records dispute with Congress, though his team filed a notice of appeal that is expected to keep the court battles running for months. Pelosi said the court victories were ``no surprise.'' The Democrats leaving that Capitol meeting appeared to be taking hers words into consideration, even as many say the march to impeach becomes more inevitable. Tennessee Rep Steve Cohen, who called for the impeachment inquiry on Tuesday, said he could see both sides. Of leaders' reluctance, Cohen said ``it's a political concern rather than an actual constitutional one.'' Rep. Katie Hill, a freshman from a California swing district, said she is undecided on starting an impeachment inquiry but wants to let the court action play out. The more Trump ``defies us, the more that it's becoming an inevitability,'' she said. But she doesn't think the Democratic caucus ``is there yet.'' Pelosi faces her own political calculations amid the push-pull of impeachment. While Democrats have a majority in the House, and would likely find support for starting impeachment proceedings, it could be a tighter vote than the 235-197 margin suggests. Many lawmakers come from relatively conservative districts where Trump also has support. Democrats have long said they can work on two tracks — conducting oversight and legislating on their agenda of lower health care costs and infrastructure investment. But Trump says they can't do both. ``They can continue the Witch Hunt ... or get back to work,'' Trump tweeted. Pelosi showed no signs of backing down. ""The fact is, in plain sight, in the public domain, this president is obstructing justice and he's engaged in a cover-up, and that could be impeachable,"" Pelosi said during an event later at the liberal Center for American Progress. ""As they say, the cover up is frequently worse than the crime,"" she said. She reminded that the third article of impeachment against President Richard Nixon was his obstruction of Congress.

The results of India's general elections are very significant for Pakistan as the formation of the next government in New Delhi will determine the course of Indo-Pakistan ties, which were pushed to a new low after the Pulwama terror attack. 'Modi's BJP secures early lead as vote count underway' was the headline of the leading newspaper Dawn as the counting of votes began in India. The newspaper's website had a separate section for providing live updates about the results of major candidates and their reaction over initial trends. The Express Tribune carried an agency story 'Modi on the brink of sweeping Indian elections' and said Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ahead in 292 of the 542 seats available, well over the 272 seats needed for a majority in the lower house of Parliament. An outright majority for Modi's party will likely embolden Hindu groups, who want to assert their dominance in the country, to the alarm of minority Muslims, the story said. Geo TV, however kept the coverage simple by providing data only on the initial trends. Sate-run Radio Pakistan in its South Asia segment carried a story titled 'Modi's BJP leads in early India vote count'. Almost all Pakistani news channels and newspapers also provided details of the coverage by the Indian media. In April, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan said he believed there may be a better chance of peace talks with India and settle the Kashmir issue if Modi's party BJP wins the general elections. Tensions flared up between India and Pakistan after a suicide bomber of Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) killed 40 CRPF personnel in Kashmir's Pulwama district on February 14. Amid mounting outrage, the Indian Air Force (IAF) carried out a counter-terror operation, hitting the biggest JeM training camp in Balakot, deep inside Pakistan on February 26. The next day, Pakistan Air Force retaliated and downed a MiG-21 in an aerial combat and captured an IAF pilot, who was handed over to India.

The elections, which run through Sunday and take place in all of the European Union's 28 nations, have never had stakes that high. Europe's traditional political powerhouses — the center-right European People's Party and the center-left Socialists & Democrats — are set to lose some clout and face their strongest challenge yet from an array of populist, nationalist and far-right parties that are determined to claw back power from the EU for their own national governments. Here's a look at the vote that starts Thursday in the Netherlands and Britain: This clash of basic values — between Europe growing more united or more divided — has put the continent at a historic political crossroads. French President Emmanuel Macron, champion of the closer-integration camp, says the challenge at the polls this week is to ""not cede to a coalition of destruction and disintegration"" that will seek to dismantle the unity the EU has built up over the past six decades. Facing off against Macron and Europe's traditional parties are Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, French far-right leader Marine Le Pen and a host of other populist, right-wing or far-right leaders who have vowed to fundamentally upend Europe's political landscape. Nationalist leaders from 11 EU nations stood together in Milan last weekend — a show of unity unthinkable in previous years from a group once considered to be on Europe's political fringe. Salvini then declared ""the extremists are in Brussels,"" the home of EU institutions, for wanting to retain the status quo. ""We need to do everything that is right to free this country, this continent, from the illegal occupation organised by Brussels,"" Salvini said. Europe's far-right and nationalist parties hope to emulate what President Donald Trump did in the 2016 US election and what Brexiteers achieved in the UK referendum to leave the EU. That is to disrupt the powers that be, rail against what they see as an out-of-touch elite and warn against migrants massing at Europe's borders ready to rob the continent of its jobs and culture. Standing with Salvini, Le Pen promised the far-right ""will perform a historic feat,"" saying they could end up as high as the second-biggest political group in the EU parliament. Predictions show that is still extremely ambitious. Projections released by the European Parliament this month show the center-right European People's Party bloc losing 37 of its 217 seats and the center-left S&D group dropping from 186 seats to 149. As for the far-right and nationalists, the Europe of Nations and Freedom group is predicted to win 62 seats, compared to 37 currently. Such statistics though could be irrelevant as soon as Monday if national parties start shifting to other EU-wide political groups in the 751-seat European legislature which meets both in Brussels and France's Strasbourg. Orban's nationalist Fidesz party is now in the EPP's ranks, but has been suspended for its anti-EU stance and virulent anti-migration rhetoric. The Hungarian prime minister might well bolt after the election to a new radical-right group, perhaps to be formed by Salvini, Le Pen and other nationalist leaders. For many among the EU's half billion citizens, the memories of war have vanished and the EU's role in helping to keep the peace for 75 years, a feat for which it won the Nobel Prize, is overlooked. Yet Europe was body-slammed by the financial crisis a decade ago and struggled through a yearslong debt crisis that saw nations like Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus get bailouts and produced recessions that slashed the incomes of millions. Europe's high taxes, stagnant wages and gap between rich and poor are still a sore point, highlighted now by weekly protests by France's yellow vest movement demanding more help for hard-pressed workers. EU nations have also not been able to forge a common approach to migration, fueling inter-bloc tensions, and its impotence in quickly containing a migrant influx in 2015 has propelled a surge of support for far-right and nationalist parties. ""We have a crisis of the European Union. This is a matter of fact,"" Macron acknowledged. ""There are a lot of people who fear that things potentially are moving in the wrong direction or already have moved in the wrong direction,"" said Janis Emmanouilidis at the European Policy Centre think-tank in Brussels. ""It is a mix of multiple insecurities which, at the end of the day, is pushing people toward those who are coming up with easy answers."" Since the first European Parliament election in 1979, the legislature has slowly changed from a toothless organization where over-the-hill politicians got cushy pre-retirement jobs to a potent force with real decision-making powers. The EU at first primarily regulated farming but now sets international trade policy for all members and even monetary rules for the 19 nations who use the shared euro currency.

On Thursday, May, as India watches the results roll in from the world’s largest democratic elections, Britons will be casting their votes in the world’s second-largest democratic contest – the European elections, which 400 million people can vote in. This, despite the fact that the Brits voted to leave the bloc in June 2016. In a bizarre twist, they are now expected to vote for 73 MEPs to sit in the 751-seat European Parliament, which holds elections every five years. If the two sides separate soon, the UK MEPs may only be in their seats a few months in an election which will cost more than £100m (Rs 895 crore). In a further twist, a political party formed four months ago on a single campaign issue to get the UK out of the EU, looks set to sweep the polls. Brexit Party set up by Nigel Farage in January is forecast to win 35% of the UK vote share, followed by Lib Dems (16%), Labour (15%) and the Greens (10%), pushing the Conservatives into fifth place at 9% according to YouGov’s latest poll. “The first opinion poll after Brexit Party formed saw it leading, and that has only grown as the two main parties have been losing their vote share — Conservatives to Brexit Party and Labour to Lib Dems,” Chris Curtis, research manager at YouGov said. “People rarely vote on candidates,” Curtis said. “Last time UKIP managed to win 24 seats. This election has always been seen in the UK as protest against mainstream parties,” Curtis added. “It is unlikely the majority of public can name their current MEPs, let alone the MEP candidate. It is very unlikely they know the party policy on anything ‘EU’ beyond their decision on Brexit,” he said. In 2014, the turnout was just 35%. This time, 62% Conservative voters are forecast to vote the Brexit Party – which jumps to 78% when considering Tories, who voted Leave. About 14% of Labour voters will switch too. Remainers in both parties are joining the Lib Dems and the Greens. Labour has seen a vote collapse because of a lack of clarity of its position on Brexit, UKIP has lost its best asset – Farage — and there is anger at the Tories about Theresa May, her deal, and the delay to Brexit. Change UK is fighting against Lib Dems and Greens as all three are pro-Remain. The Lib Dems and Greens are riding on a strong performance in the local elections. “Since 1984 a governing party has not won these elections in Britain. People use them to send a message,"" explained Dominic Walsh, policy analyst at think tank Open Europe. “The majority are treating these elections as a Brexit protest vote. There is little focus on candidates.” Although no-one expected these elections to take place, there is no shortage of candidates. In London alone 88 candidates are vying for eight seats. A monthly income of €8,757.70 (Rs 6.8 lakh) and a jet set lifestyle between Strasbourg and Brussels awaits an MEP.

May received a flurry of criticism and hostile questions in the House of Commons as she implored lawmakers to support a bill implementing Britain's departure from the European Union that she plans to put to a vote in Parliament in June. Almost three years after British voters opted to leave the EU, May said ""we need to see Brexit through, to honor the result of the referendum and to deliver the change the British people so clearly demanded."" She said that if Parliament rejected her deal, ""all we have before us is division and deadlock."" That appears to be a fair summary of the current situation. Lawmakers have already rejected May's divorce deal with the other 27 EU countries on three occasions, and Britain's long-scheduled departure date of March 29 passed with the country still in the bloc. In a last-ditch bid to secure support for her Brexit plan, May on Tuesday announced concessions including a promise to give Parliament a vote on whether to hold a new referendum on Britain's EU membership _ something she has long ruled out. ""I have compromised. Now I ask you to compromise too,"" she said. But there was little sign her plea was being heeded. Pro-EU and pro-Brexit lawmakers have only hardened their positions during months of political trench warfare, and are in no mood to compromise. Pro-Brexit Conservatives accused May of capitulating to pro-EU demands, and opposition Labour Party lawmakers dismissed her offer as too little too late. ""The rhetoric may have changed but the deal has not,"" said Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. ""She did not seek a compromise until after she had missed her own deadline to leave, and by the time she finally did she had lost the authority to deliver."" May's authority as Conservative leader has been shredded by her loss of the party's parliamentary majority in a 2017 election and her failure to lead Britain out of the EU as promised. The party's powerful euroskeptic wing wants to oust May and replace her with a staunch Brexit supporter such as Boris Johnson, a former foreign secretary. May has said she will announce a timetable for her departure once Parliament has voted on her Brexit bill. But with defeat of that bill looking highly likely, a growing number of Conservatives is pressing her to cancel the vote and quit even sooner. May survived a no-confidence vote among Conservative lawmakers in December, leaving her safe from challenge for 12 months under party rules. Brexit-backing lawmaker Nigel Evans said he would urge the party committee that oversees leadership contests to change the rules when it meets Wednesday so that May can face a new challenge within days. ""There is a growing discontent with the way Theresa May has handled this,"" Evans said. ""Let's have somebody who has a clean sheet and will be able to reboot the (Brexit) negotiations."" Pressure on May is likely to increase when results come in from this week's European Parliament elections, in which the Conservatives expect to receive a drubbing. Many British voters on both sides of the Brexit debate look set to use the election to the EU legislature to express displeasure over the country's political gridlock. Opinion polls show strong support for the single-issue Brexit Party — largely from angry former Conservative voters — and for pro-EU parties including the Liberal Democrats and the Greens. The election is being held Thursday in Britain, but results won't be announced until all 28 EU countries have finished voting late Sunday. May said the Brexit withdrawal bill would be published Friday so that lawmakers can study it. Environment Secretary Michael Gove would not confirm that the bill would definitely be put to a vote the week of June 3, as May has promised. ``We will reflect over the course of the next few days on how people look at the proposition that has been put forward,"" he said.

Police said Sadiqullah Momand entered Pakistan through Torkham area on May 6 and blew himself up near a police van at the shrine of Ali Hajvari commonly known as Data Darbar. Police also claim to have arrested one named Mohsin Khan, who is the main facilitator of the terror attack . Thirteen people, including five police personnel, were killed when a suicide bomber blew himself up outside the Data Darbar, the largest Sufi shrine in South Asia.

Hizbul Ahrar is a splinter group of Jamaatul Ahrar headed by Muqarram Shah from Afghanistan. It separated from Jamaatul Ahrar due to internal rifts. Police said that the blast facilitator, Mohsin Khan moved to Lahore a couple of weeks before the blast and rented a house at Bhati Gate, a residential area near the shrine.

Addressing the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Council of Foreign Ministers' meeting in Bishkek, also attended by external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj, Qureshi said Pakistan condemned terrorism in all its forms but stressed the need for addressing the ""root causes"" of the problem. ""Enduring peace and prosperity in South Asia will remain elusive without good-faith diplomacy and result-oriented dialogue,"" he said in his address. India has told Pakistan that talks and terrorism will not go hand-in-hand. ""Pakistan has given the message of peace by opening the Kartarpur Corridor for the Sikh community,"" he said. Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated after the February 14 Pulwama attack by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) terror group which killed 40 CRPF personnel. Amid mounting outrage, the Indian Air Force carried out a counter-terror operation, hitting a JeM training camp in Balakot in Pakistan on February 26.

Condemning terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, Qureshi stressed the need for ""addressing the root causes of the problem,"" Geo News quoted the foreign minister as saying. He informed other foreign ministers of the SCO that Pakistan was among one of the few countries to have ""successfully fought"" and ""reversed"" the tide of terrorism and extremism and was ready to share its experience and expertise with the SCO states through the Regional Anti Terrorist Structure. Pakistan initiated work on the Kartarpur Corridor to facilitate pilgrimage of Sikh pilgrims to visit their holy shrine, he said, adding that ""the Shanghai Spirit was being reinforced through the Kartarpur Spirit."" Last November, India and Pakistan agreed to set up the border crossing linking Gurudwara Darbar Sahib in Pakisan's Kartarpur, the final resting place of Sikh faith's founder Guru Nanak Dev, to Dera Baba Nanak shrine in India's Gurdaspur district. Kartarpur Sahib is located in Pakistan's Narowal district across the river Ravi, about four kilometres from the Dera Baba Nanak shrine. The shrine is visible from the Indian side of the border and everyday a larger number of Sikh devotees gather to perform Darshan or sacred viewings of the site. The two sides have continued talks on the corridor despite their recent military standoff after the Pulwama terror attack. Pakistan is hopeful that the landmark corridor will become functional on the 550th birth anniversary of Baba Guru Nanak in November this year. Qureshi also said Afghanistan remained central to Pakistan's efforts to forge lasting regional stability and consistently called for an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned process of dialogue and reconciliation as the only viable way forward. The foreign minister mentioned that as the leadership of SCO member states would meet in June, there was a need to discuss the challenges confronting sustainable growth, environment and collective security. Qureshi also presented a seven-point agenda at the SCO meeting focusing on confidence-building measures among member states including control on weapons race, establishment of joint fund and international framework to combat corruption and crime, Pakistan's official APP news agency reported.

The insolvency will leave 1,000 people out of work and reignited worries about local retail and food outlets in Britain, which are struggling to attract customers much like downtowns in the US. “I’m devastated that our much-loved U.K. restaurants have gone into administration,” Oliver wrote on Twitter. “I am deeply saddened by this outcome and would like to thank all of the staff and our suppliers who have put their hearts and souls into this business over the years.” Financial firm KPMG, which will oversee the process, said all but three of the group’s 25 eateries will close. They include restaurants in the Jamie’s Italian chain, as will the more upmarket Fifteen, and steak house Barbecoa. Two restaurants and a diner at Gatwick Airport will continue to operate while joint administrators explore options for the site. Overseas branches of Jamie’s Italian, Jamie’s Pizzeria and Jamie's Deli, are not affected, nor is Fifteen Cornwall, which operates as a franchise. Other chains run by celebrity chefs have also struggled in recent years. Thomas Keller closed Bouchon in Beverly Hills at the end of 2017, saying it couldn’t remain profitable. That same year, Guy Fieri closed Guy’s American Kitchen and Bar in Times Square and Daniel Boulud closed DBGB Kitchen and Bar in New York, saying it didn’t get enough business during the week. Bad behaviour can also hurt chains’ success. In March, Mario Batali gave up his financial stakes in all of his restaurants after being accused of sexual harassment. Oliver said Jamie’s Italian was launched in 2008 “with the intention of positively disrupting mid-market dining” with higher quality ingredients, animal welfare standards, better service and good value. But the launch came just as local businesses throughout the UK were squeezed by the onset of the 2008 financial crisis. Rising food prices, increasing rents and competition took a toll. The firm had been in trouble for at least two years, despite Oliver’s global fame on the back of his cookbooks and TV shows. Last year, it shuttered 12 of its 37 sites in Britain, while five branches of the Australian arm of Jamie’s Italian were sold off and another put into administration. He has personally pumped 13 million pounds into his Italian chain, but it was not enough.

A nine-day ban on platforms including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and WhatsApp was introduced following the Islamic State-claimed attacks on churches and hotels on April 21 which killed 258 people and wounded nearly 500. Many anxious social media users switched to virtual private networks (VPNs) or the TOR network to bypass the order and keep communication open with friends and relatives as the extent of the carnage became clear. But for others, the tools were a means to spread confusion and vitriol as the island struggled to come to terms with one of the worst terror attacks in its history. Sanjana Hattotuwa, who monitors social media for fakenews at the Centre for Policy Alternatives in Colombo, said the government blackout had failed to prevent ""engagement, production, sharing and discussion of Facebook content"", and that he had seen a significant increase in false reports. AFP has published half a dozen fact-checks debunking false claims made on Facebook and Twitter after the Easter attacks. Some had dug out photos of coffins and funerals from SriLanka's brutal decades-long civil war and claimed they showed victims of the blasts. One video posted to Facebook showed police arresting a man dressed in a burqa and claimed he was involved in the bombings. The video was actually from 2018, and showed a man who had used a burqa to hide his identity while he sought to attack someone over a debt issue. Another used a five-year-old photo from India that showed a group of men wearing T-shirts with ""ISIS"", another name for Islamic State, written on them to claim there was an active IS cell in eastern Sri Lanka. One Twitter user claiming to be a high-ranking Sri Lankan army brigadier used the platform to accuse neighbouring India of being involved in the attacks. The account was later taken down by Twitter after the Sri Lankan army complained. Authorities in SriLanka -- where ethnic divisions still linger after decades of war -- previously blocked Facebook in March 2018 after Buddhist hardliners used incendiary posts to fan religious violence that left three people dead and reduced several hundred homes and shops to ashes. The surge in fakenews has further blemished the troubled reputation of social media -- which several years ago had been seen as a means to expand freedom of information -- in the region. In India, authorities have temporarily shut down mobile networks or blocked social media apps during riots, while critics say the spread of hate speech via Facebook was crucial in facilitating a brutal 2017 military crackdown on the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar. Since the attacks, Sri Lankan authorities have imposed other short bans on social media, including earlier this month after mobs in the northwestern town of Chilaw attacked Muslim-owned businesses in anger at a Facebook post by a shopkeeper. But for those unaware of the government ban or unable to circumvent it, the blocking of social media in the days following the attacks was a cause for panic. A Sydney-based engineer was desperate to call his sister in Colombo soon after hearing about the Easter blasts, but could not get through. ""I kept calling her on WhatsApp, but there was no reply. We are so used to calling on WhatsApp, I had forgotten her landline number,"" the Sri Lankan-born engineer said. Fortunately, he said, he managed to call a friend in Colombo who was using a VPN to access WhatsApp and told him about the social media ban that prevented him from reaching his sister.

Stephen Bradley Mell, 53, of Bedminster, New Jersey, pleaded guilty to federal charges of engaging in interstate travel to engage in illicit sexual conduct and receiving child pornography in December 2018 and is now due for sentencing on Tuesday. Mell, a father-of-three who had a brokerage firm, was accused of committing sex acts with a 15-year-old girl whose mother had approached him so that he could give her flying lessons, the Daily Mail reported. Ahead of his sentencing, Mell's legal team has argued he is a 'humble man' who was on 'multiple anti-depressants' after falling into 'a spiral of depression' brought on by survivors' guilt over giving up his seat on a fatal helicopter trip with friends in 2012. Mell also faces sentencing in July on a state charge related to sexual activity with the teen, which he pleaded guilty to earlier this month. Mell started his own charity, Air LifeLine, which flew children with medical needs anywhere in the US for treatment.

The Trump administration is considering blacklisting more Chinese firms in the strategic high technology space and Beijing in turn has signaled it will now be browbeaten and will hit back. Ratcheting up its attack on Beijing following its crackdown on the Chinese tech company Huawei, the Trump administration is weighing placing another Chinese firm Hikvision, the world’s largest maker of video surveillance technology, on the Commerce Department’s Entity List, that will subject it to all kinds of sanctions. The ostensible reason for the proposed action against Hikvision is that it supplied surveillance cameras that the Chinese government has deployed throughout the restive Muslim-majority Xinjiang region to combat what Beijing describes as separatist terrorism. But beneath the veneer of individual action against specific firms, it is becoming increasingly clear that the United States, under President Trump, is making a belated attempt to retrieve what it believes is the ground it has lost to China in the strategic technologies realm. Besides technology denial on grounds that Beijing has been stealing proprietary US material, the Trump administration is also rapidly lowering the boom on Chinese scholars and students, some 300,000 of whom are in America at any given time. China has supplanted Russia as the new Cold War, or Tech War, rival. China though is signalling that it will not be bullied into submission. In a striking move, Chinese President Xi Jinping toured a rare earth mining facility in China on Tuesday in what was seen in some quarters as Beijing’s readiness to use its domination of raw materials used in high-tech manufacturing to counter the US. China is the largest supplier of rare earth materials that are used in everything from mobile phones to guided missiles. By some accounts, if China were to curtail or cut off rare earth exports to the U.S., the effects could be similar to the oil crisis of the 1970s. “Rare-earth metals are essential for producing most technological equipment. It is impossible to build a car without cerium, a smartphone without europium, a guided missile without neodymium,” Michael Silver, CEO of the company American Elements that deals with the material wrote in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed. Analysts say China has used its near-monopoly over rare earth materials in international disputes before, notably against Japan in 2010, when Tokyo was forced to release the captain of a Chinese ship captain it had detained. China produces 95 per cent of the world’s rare earth materials although it has only a third of the world’s reserves, a consequence of the US, which used to be the world’s leading producer, ceding its leadership in yet another area. According to some accounts, China is also considering cutting natural gas purchases from the US as part of its retaliatory measures. Meanwhile, even as China’s President Xi is rallying his people with nationalistic appeal, warning them to be ready for harder times, American industries are already crying uncle. From shoemakers to apparel sellers, both of which sectors import some 95 per cent of their inventory, American businesses are moaning that the tariff war is going to hurt them badly, even though the Trump administration’s position it will hurt the Chinese even more. Whether the Chinese have the stomach to take the punishment and whether Americans can match that grit is something only time can tell, because eventually, it will be people in both countries who will feel the pinch.

China and Pakistan had begun joint development and manufacture of the single-engine light JF-17 jets over a decade ago. Beijing delivered the first batch in 2007 and a number of them were later commissioned by the PAF, state-run Global Times reported on Wednesday. After a decade of use, it was time for the first JF-17s to undergo overhauls, the report quoted military analysts as saying, adding that the first overhaul started in November 2017 after a contract was signed between the two sides in 2016. Changsha 5712 Aircraft Industry Co Ltd under the state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) reassembled the jet and delivered it to its Pakistani client in March, the daily quoted a report by China Aviation News. This is also the first time AVIC has overhauled a made-for-export third generation fighter, or fourth generation according to another widely used standard, the report said. ""The first [JF-17] overhaul marks an important milestone [in the JF-17 project],"" Fu Qianshao, a Chinese air defence expert, said. It represents the trial-and-error phase of the project and provided experience in establishing standards for other JF-17 overhauls in future, Qianshao said. The overhaul of the fighter jet includes major maintenance, featuring repairs and replacement of old components, including the airframe and engine. Also, a Block 3 variant of the JF-17 is under development. It is expected to be much more powerful than the previous two blocks due to new China-developed active electronically scanned array radar, the report said. Though China has made significant strides in avionics and developed new range of war planes including stealth fighters, it is yet to develop engines for its planes, including JF-17 and mostly rely on Russian supplies. Qianshao said that while standard, regular maintenance could be done by the military, an overhaul usually needs to be conducted by a designated and more capable supplier due to higher complexity. Such an overhaul can ensure flight safety after years of use. It might also equip the aircraft with newer technologies that enhance its capability, or prolong the aircraft's lifespan, he said. Pakistan sent dozens of trainees to China, who had close communication and built deep friendships with Chinese engineers during the overhaul process. Qianshao said since procedures and standards for the overhaul have been established, future overhauls on other JF-17s could be done by Pakistani personnel. ""Under the framework of China-Pakistan cooperation, Pakistan's aviation industry will continue to develop,"" he noted. JF-17 has become a mainstay of the PAF in recent years after US restricted sales of F-16 war planes after the 1990 arms embargo imposed on Pakistan under the Pressler amendment. It is reported to have over 100 JF-17 planes with more in the pipeline. JF17 is part of close defence cooperation between the two countries under which China has become a major supplier of arms to Pakistan. China is currently building four new modern naval warships for Pakistan.

Moraes, who according to Vote Watch Europe is the sixth most influential MEP, told TOI on Wednesday that the EU never expected the UK to be taking part in Thursday’s EU elections. “They genuinely felt the deal they had given Britain was a good one based on Mrs May’s red lines and they had an expectation eventually the House of Commons would agree to it and there was a sense of surprise Britain did not agree. They expected we would leave on March 29 or shortly afterwards.” Moraes (53), the first Asian male MEP, who is standing as a Labour candidate for re-election in London, said EU negotiators are ready for a populist leader such as Boris Johnson or Dominic Raab to take May's place but will not soften their stance nor re-open the deal. ""If anything, they will harden to someone like that,"" he said. ""I have heard that repeatedly from most senior people in EU and I chair the biggest committee in the EU parliament. The EU has known for a long time Theresa May could be toppled and they know the rules for choosing a new Tory leader can be circumvented,"" he said. He said the fourth deal has “no chance whatsoever of getting through the Commons as Labour MPs will not vote for it”, “it’s a fudge on customs union” and “May is not proposing a referendum, rather a vote on one.” He said, ""The potential now is they will move on the day after the European election results. I suspect they will move on her next week…”. May survived a no-confidence vote among Conservative MPs in December meaning that no further challenge can be made for 12 months, but Moraes explained there are some “options"" that could oust her. He said there was the “grey suit option” in which the cabinet walk out. “There is also a nuclear option where the majority of chairmen have to write to the 1922 committee and she has to step down. If she doesn’t then a majority will be created among Tory MPs in a vote of no-confidence and that would lead to a general election which the Tories don’t want as many Tory MPs could get wiped out.” The UK is currently set to leave the EU on October 31 with or without a deal.

The attack on Najran comes as Iran quadrupled its uranium-enrichment production capacity amid tensions with the US over Tehran's atomic program, nuclear officials said Monday, just after President Donald Trump and Iran's foreign minister traded threats and taunts on Twitter. Iranian officials made a point to stress that the uranium would be enriched only to the 3.67 per cent limit set under the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, making it usable for a power plant but far below what's needed for an atomic weapon. But by increasing production, Iran soon will exceed the stockpile limitations set by the accord. Tehran has set a July 7 deadline for Europe to set new terms for the deal, or it will enrich closer to weapons-grade levels in a Middle East already on edge. The Trump administration has deployed bombers and an aircraft carrier to the region over still-unspecified threats from Iran. In the drone attack, the Houthi's Al-Masirah satellite news channel said early Tuesday they targeted the airport in Najran with a Qasef-2K drone, striking an ""arms depot"" there. Najran, 840 kilometers (525 miles) southwest of Riyadh, is right on the Saudi border with Yemen and has repeatedly been targeted by the Iranian-allied Houthis. A statement earlier Tuesday on the state-run Saudi Press Agency quoted Saudi-led coalition spokesman Col. Turki al-Maliki as saying the Houthis ""had tried to target"" a civilian site in Najran, without elaborating. It was not clear if there were any injuries. Al-Maliki warned there would be a ""strong deterrent"" to such attacks and described the Houthis as the ""terrorist militias of Iran."" Such Houthi attacks in the past have sparked rounds of Saudi-led airstrikes on Yemen, which have been widely criticized internationally for killing civilians. Civilian airports throughout the Middle East often host military bases. The New York Times last year reported that American intelligence analysts were based in Najran assisting the Saudis and a US Army Green Berets deployment on the border. The Pentagon and the US military's Central Command did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Last week, the Houthis launched a coordinated drone attack on a Saudi oil pipeline amid heightened tensions between Iran and the US. That came as already this month, officials in the United Arab Emirates alleged that four oil tankers were sabotaged and US diplomats relayed a warning that commercial airlines could be misidentified by Iran and attacked, something dismissed by Tehran. Iran's enrichment announcement came after journalists visiting the country's underground enrichment facility in Natanz were given a statement by an unidentified nuclear scientist who wore a surgical cap and a mask. His outfit wasn't explained, although Israel is suspected of targeting Iranian nuclear scientists. The state-run IRNA news agency later quoted Behrouz Kamalvandi, the spokesman of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, as acknowledging that capacity had been quadrupled. He said Iran took this step because the US had ended a program allowing it to exchange enriched uranium to Russia for unprocessed yellowcake uranium, as well as ending the sale of heavy water to Oman. Heavy water helps cool reactors producing plutonium that can be used in nuclear weapons. Kamalvandi said Iran had informed the International Atomic Energy Agency of the development. The Vienna-based UN nuclear watchdog did not respond to a request for comment. Tehran long has insisted it does not seek nuclear weapons, though the West fears its program could allow it to build them. Before Iran's announcement, Trump tweeted: ""If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran. Never threaten the United States again!"" Trump's remarks reflect what has been a strategy of alternating tough talk with more conciliatory statements he says is aimed at keeping Iran guessing at the administration's intentions. He also has said he hopes Iran calls him and engages in negotiations. He described his approach in a speech Friday, saying, ""It's probably a good thing because they're saying, 'Man, I don't know where these people are coming from,' right?"" But while Trump's approach of flattery and threats has become a hallmark of his foreign policy, the risks have only grown in dealing with Iran, where mistrust between Tehran and Washington stretch four decades. While both sides say they don't seek war, many worry any miscalculation could spiral out of control. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif soon responded by tweeting that Trump had been ""goaded"" into ""genocidal taunts."" Zarif referenced both Alexander the Great and Genghis Khan as two historical leaders that Persia outlasted. ""Iranians have stood tall for a millennia while aggressors all gone,"" he wrote. ""Try respect - it works!"" Zarif also used the hashtag #NeverThreatenAnIranian, a reference to a comment he made during intense negotiations for the 2015 nuclear accord.

Now President Trump is sealing up that wall from the other side. Google on Monday began to limit the software services it provides to Huawei, the telecommunications giant, following a White House order last week that restricted the Chinese company’s access to American technology. Google’s software powers Huawei’s smartphones, and its apps come preloaded on the devices Huawei sells around the world. The move could hamstring Huawei, the world’s second-largest smartphone maker, if Google restricts access to the latest versions of popular services such as Maps, Gmail and YouTube. For Huawei, the big impact will be abroad since Chinese customers already have limited access to Google’s services. Google’s move will have its biggest effect in places like Europe where it has emerged as a big smartphone seller. Other companies will inevitably follow. In effect, the move puts pressure on Huawei’s international expansion dreams. If China and the US have begun a technological Cold War, then the Huawei order can best be seen as the beginnings of a digital Iron Curtain. Google, owned by Alphabet Inc, said it was enacting restrictions on Android updates after Trump added Huawei to a trade blacklist, making it extremely difficult for it to do business with US counterparts. “We are complying with the order and reviewing the implications,” a Google spokesman said. The American company, however, said its services would continue to function on existing Huawei devices. Trump last week issued a ban on American telecommunications firms’ installing foreign-made equipment that could pose a threat to national security. On the same day, the commerce department added Huawei to a list of companies deemed a risk to national security, effectively preventing the company from buying American parts and technologies without special permission from Washington. In isolating Huawei, the Trump administration is escalating a trade dispute with Beijing and harming a company that the American authorities have long accused of posing a national security risk — charges that Huawei has vehemently denied. After struggling to convince allies like Britain and Germany to block the use of Huawei telecommunications equipment, the Trump administration is now undermining Huawei’s business by cutting off its access to crucial American suppliers, including chip makers. In complying with the US’s order, Google is undercutting ties with an important and fast-growing partner. Huawei’s sales in the first quarter of 2019 grew 50% compared to the same period a year earlier, even as the broader smartphone market stagnated, according to the research firm IDC. While Huawei products have effectively been blocked in the US for years, the company’s business has grown rapidly in Africa, Asia and Europe, where its affordable prices have been embraced by consumers and by phone companies that use its antennas, base stations and other equipment to make wireless networks. Huawei said it will support its smartphones and tablets by providing security updates and services. “Huawei will continue to provide security updates and after-sales services to all existing Huawei and Honor smartphone and tablet products, covering those that have been sold and that are still in stock globally. We will continue to build a safe and sustainable software ecosystem,” a spokesman said. Though Huawei has not yet said how it will respond to the US order, the Chinese government suggested a legal challenge. Asked about Google’s decision at a regularly scheduled news briefing on Monday, foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said: “China encourages Chinese companies to take up legal weapons to defend their own legitimate rights.” In Video:Google will comply with US restrictions on Huawei Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."|"Google restricts Huawei access to Android after Donald Trump order"|"Tue May 21 13:28:00 CEST 2019"|"[world]"

Prime minister Scott Morrison chose the latest possible date to call an election that on Saturday delivered his conservative coalition a surprise victory. But the timing means he probably won't be able to recall Parliament to pass the tax cuts before July 1 _ the date he promised during the election campaign that the lower tax rate would take effect. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said passing the legislation, which would reduce the annual tax bill of 10 million Australians by 1,080 Australian dollars ($740), is the government's first priority when Parliament resumes. Frydenberg could not say when the law would be passed, but said media reports that the new tax rates might not come into effect until July 1 next year were wrong. The tax break was outlined in April in the government's annual budget blueprint for the next fiscal year, which starts on July 1. ""Let me be very clear: The tax relief outlined in the budget will be delivered to millions of Australians,'' Frydenberg said. However, the ruling coalition will not hold a majority of seats in the Senate, so the government will need the support of the center-left Labor Party opposition or minor parties to pass the tax law legislation. Because of the weakening economy and persistent low inflation, Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe suggested on Tuesday that the central bank board was likely to reduce its benchmark interest rate below the current record low 1.5% when it next meets on June 4. The rate has not changed since August 2016. In more concerning news for an Australian economy that has grown for 28 years without a recession, a university study released on Tuesday found that Chinese investment in the country fell by 50% between 2017 and 2018. The Australian National University research showed Chinese investment fell from AU$9.6 billion ($6.6 billion) in 2017 to AU$4.8 billion ($3.3 billion) last year _ the lowest level in the five years since the university began monitoring Chinese investment. Researchers said the decline was in line with global Chinese investment trends. Frydenberg said Australia was susceptible to the trade tensions between China and the United States, Australia's biggest source of foreign capital. ``It's very clear that the Australian economy is facing some economic headwinds _ economic headwinds globally as trade tensions rise between China and the United States,'' Frydenberg said. ``But the fundamentals of the Australian economy are sound.'' In better economic news, the government's reelection contributed to a AU$33 billion ($23 billion) surge in the stock market on Monday to an 11-year high, in part because of expectations of a better business environment and tax cuts. Analysts see Morrison's re-election as a new opportunity to reset Australia's relationship with China, which suffered under his predecessor, Malcolm Turnbull. Beijing protested when Turnbull announced legislation in 2017 to outlaw covert foreign interference in domestic politics. Chinese companies were blocked from buying crucial Australian infrastructure and Chinese technology giant Huawei was banned from involvement in the rollout of Australia's 5G telecommunications network on security grounds. Morrison was thrust into the government leadership last August after colleagues in his conservative Liberal Party lost confidence in Turnbull. Morrison has since been kept busy uniting his government, which was bitterly divided over Turnbull's ouster in a ballot of lawmakers. Michael Fullilove, executive director of the Lowy Institute for International Policy, a Sydney think tank, said the surprise election result had given Morrison a mandate to reshape the relationship with China. ``His international role essentially begins this week because for the first nine months, he was necessarily distracted by domestic issues. I think he was seen as a stop-gap leader internationally, but now he has a mandate, he has immense authority within in his party,'' Fullilove told Australian Broadcasting Corp. ``He has inherited a hawkish policy from Prime Minister Turnbull, but that suit doesn't really seem to fit him,'' Fullilove said. ``He's a more commercially minded, more pragmatic person. He and Foreign Minister (Marise) Payne have tried to repair the relationship with China in recent months.'' As vote counting continued on Tuesday, the government appeared likely to have as many as 78 seats in the 151-seat House of Representatives, where parties need a majority to govern. The government will likely have within its ranks the first Chinese-Australian woman elected to Parliament, Gladys Liu. Morrison led a minority government of 74 lawmakers into the election, with the opposition firm favorites to win.

A ranger has to explain why no one can pass: The landscape cannot sustain more visitors. Blame Justin Bieber. His video “I’ll Show You” was filmed at the canyon and seen by millions, creating overwhelming demand for the spot. For a chance to follow in Bieber’s footsteps, his fans are not letting a few fences, signs or rangers keep them away. Visitors try to sweet-talk ranger Hanna Johannsdottir into opening the gate. Some offer bribes. “Food from people’s home country is the most common,” said Johannsdottir, who has turned down a free trip to Dubai. Last year 2.3 million tourists visited Iceland, compared with 6,00,000 eight years ago. The 20% annual uptick in visitors has been out of proportion with infrastructure that is needed to protect Iceland’s volcanic landscape, where soil forms slowly and erodes quickly. Environment minister Gudmundur Ingi Gudbrandsson said it is “a bit too simplistic to blame the entire situation on Justin Bieber” but urged famous, influential visitors to consider the consequences of their actions. “In Justin Bieber’s defence, the canyon did not, at the time, have rope fences and designated paths to show what was allowed and what not,” Gudbrandsson said. Over 1 million people have visited the area since the release of the video, the Environment Agency of Iceland estimates, leaving scars on its vegetation.

Naureen Leghari, a second-year student of the Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences (LUMHS) in Jamshoro, Sindh, went missing in February 2017 from his native town of Hussainabad, a suburb of Hyderabad. She was arrested after two months from Lahore following an encounter in which her associate Ali was killed by security forces. After her arrest, LUMHS cancelled her admission. She then got admission in the English Department of the University of Sindh in November 2018 but when the varsity got knowledge of her background, it cancelled her admission, the News reported. Her father Dr Abdul Jabbar Leghari is working at the University as a professor in Dr MA Kazi Institute of Chemistry. Naureen and her father have approached Sindh High Court filing a joint constitutional petition against the University of Sindh, praying that according to article K-25 of Constitution, the University management could not deny her right of education. Vice Chancellor Fateh Burfat told the media that University management is verifying the facts that why Naureen was expelled from LUMHS and after getting verification from law enforcement agencies, it will decide about her. University Spokesman Nadir Ali Mugheri said that she concealed facts about cancellation of her previous admission while applying at Sindh University. ""When the administration of the University came to know about the facts regarding annulment of her admission at LUMHS, it cancelled her admission,"" he said.

In a confessional statement which was played during a press conference by Pakistan's Military spokesman Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor here, Naureen said that she was to be used by the Islamic State as a suicide bomber on an attack to be conducted on a church on Easter Sunday. She said they were given two suicide jackets, four grenade and some bullets by the ISIS to carry out the mission. However, their mission was foiled by the security forces who killed one militant and arrested two others, including Naureen.

The elections to select 73 members of the European Parliament to represent the UK in the 751-seat European Parliament will take place on May 23 since the UK is still a member of the bloc and has not yet left. Labour is performing very badly in the polls, having slipped to third place, after the Lib Dems. Speaking to the congregation at Sri Guru Singh Sabha in Southall, the Labour leader repeated his assurance that the next Labour government would make an apology for the Jallianwala Bagh massacre of 100 years ago. He also reiterated his commitment, as made in his party’s 2017 manifesto, to hold an inquiry into the British government’s role in the 1984 Sikh genocide. His visit to speak to Sikhs had been organised by Sikhs for Labour. Labour’s Neena Gill MEP, the first India-born and Punjabi MEP and the only Sikh MEP, who is chair of Sikhs for Labour, spoke, as did MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi, Seema Malhotra and John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor. Gill, who has been an MEP since 1999 and is standing for re-election in the West Midlands, told TOI: “I am delighted that Jeremy and John took up the invite of Sikhs for Labour to pay their respects and show support for the Sikh candidates in the European Parliament elections.” Whilst Labour has 246 seats in the House of Commons and the Lib Dems have only 11, according to the latest YouGov poll, Labour is set to win only 15% of the vote share, falling into third place, after the Lib Dems at 16% and the Brexit Party, who are set to win 35%. “Labour has seen a vote collapse, albeit not as bad as the Tories as they are not in government. Labour is losing different directions. Seventy per cent of Labour wants to remain and those voters are moving to the Lib Dems and Greens, and the 30% who want to leave are voting for the Brexit Party. The reason for the collapse of the vote is that Labour has sat on the fence saying it wants to deliver the EU referendum result but has not voted for any of Theresa May’s deals, and has a confusing policy on a second referendum,” explained Dominic Walsh, policy analyst at think tank Open Europe. “The next general election may come much sooner than everyone expected with Theresa May being forced to step down within the next few weeks,” said Bhai Amrik Singh, chair of the Sikh Federation UK (SFUK). “The SFUK has identified 135 seats in a general election where the Sikh vote will matter.

The Supreme Court earlier this month dismissed the 69-year-old three-time prime minister's review petition seeking permanent bail on medical grounds and the permission to go abroad for treatment. Sharif returned to the Kot Lakhpat jail on May 7 to serve his seven-year prison term in the case after the end of his six-week bail, which was granted to him on medical grounds with a condition that he would not leave Pakistan. Opinions of specialist doctors from Switzerland, the US and the UK have been included in the petition filed at the high court by Sharif's counsel Khawaja Haris, the Express Tribune reported. ""According to the medical board, Nawaz is suffering from numerous diseases,"" the petition said. According to the reports, doctors recommended that Sharif's condition is life-threatening. Tension and stress can prove to be threatening to his life, it added. Even Sharif's blood and sugar levels have not normalised, the petition went on to add. The petition stated that all members of the special medical board, along with doctors associated with doctors hospital Lahore, Sheikh Zayed Hospital Lahore and National Hospital Lahore as well as medical specialists from UK, USA and Switzerland were unanimous that Sharif's treatment is not possible in jail premises. The former premier, who has been serving a seven-year prison term at Lahore's Kot Lakhpat Jail since December 24, 2018, was granted a six-week bail on March 26 to get medical treatment. However, Sharif filed a civil review petition against the order on April 27. The petition requested the court to allow Sharif get medical treatment abroad, claiming that the former prime minister was suffering from acute anxiety and depression that would lead to ‘sudden death'. It said the medical professionals seeing the former premier in Pakistan recommend that he should be treated by his regular practitioners in the United Kingdom. It also said that there was a difference between the apex court's March 26 oral order and the written order. However, a three-judge special bench, headed by Pakistan Chief Justice Asif Saeed Khosa and comprising Justice Sajjad Ali Shah and Justice Yahya Afridi, dismissed the petition. Sharif was convicted by an accountability court in one of the three corruption cases filed in the wake of the apex court's July 28, 2017 order in Panama Papers case.

In a speech on national security at Scotland Yard headquarters in London, UK home secretary Sajid Javid warned British nationals to leave conflict-ridden territories or risk a jail term of up to 10 years, effectively imposing a ban on travel to Idlib and the northeast of Syria under new powers to tackle suspected terrorists. ""Each and every day, our security services fight against terror - from large international terrorist groups, to radicalised individuals. In the past two years, they have foiled 19 major terrorist attacks - 14 of them Islamist, and five of them motivated by extreme right-wing ideologies,"" said Javid, the UK's senior-most Pakistani-origin minister. ""And despite this impressive work, the tempo of terrorist activity is increasing,"" he warned. Laying out details of the UK's new Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Act, he unveiled powers to ""designate"" a region anywhere in the world and make it an offence for British nationals to be there. He said: ""I've asked my officials to work closely with CT (Counter-Terrorism) policing and intelligence agencies to urgently review the case for exercising this power in relation to Syria, with a particular focus on Idlib and the North East. ""So, anyone who is in these areas without a legitimate reason should be on notice. I can also see that there may be a case in the future for considering designating parts of West Africa."" The Act follows the high-profile case of Bangladeshi-origin British schoolgirl Shamima Begum, who had travelled to the ISIS-controlled region over four years ago before discovery in a detention camp earlier this year. She has since been stripped of her British citizenship and her London-based family has launched a legal bid to bring her back. ""Deprivation is never a step that is taken lightly…When we assess that someone poses a real threat, we will work to stop them from returning. Sometimes to do that I have to deprive people of their British nationality,"" said Javid. If the Syrian regions are designated under the new UK act, Britons detained by the Syrian Defence Forces will be deemed unable to leave and return to the UK. A person already in a designated area at the time of designation will not commit an offence if they leave the area within one month of such an order being made. Other exemptions have been written into the legislation, passed by the UK Parliament last month, to protect those who have a legitimate reason for being in a designated area or conducting research online, such as journalists. As part of a package of security measures, Javid also announced the appointment of Barrister Jonathan Hall as the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation. ""With the threat from terrorism continuing to evolve and diversify, it is vital we have robust oversight to ensure our counter-terrorism laws are fair, necessary and proportionate,"" said Javid. As part of the new role, Hall will be required to provide an annual report on his findings which the government must lay before Parliament and publish. The minister stressed on the need for a global effort to fight terror as groups like Al Qaeda and ISIS continue to pose a threat. He said: ""Of all the terrorist plots thwarted by the UK and our Western allies last year, 80 per cent were planned by people inspired by the ideology of Daesh (ISIS), but who had never actually been in contact with the so-called Caliphate. And just as its fighters were drawn from every corner of the world, including too many Brits, we have taken an international response to this menace."" Javid's speech also revealed a planned crackdown on hostile spying activity, with plans in the works for foreign spies to add their names to a register as part of a new Espionage Bill. ""I have also asked my officials to consider the case for updating treason laws. Our definition of terrorism is probably broad enough to cover those who betray our country by supporting terror abroad. But if updating the old offence of treason would help us to counter hostile state activity, then there is merit in considering that too,"" he said.

Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, better known as Hemedti, had led the so-called Rapid Support Forces on a series of counterinsurgency campaigns in Darfur and other restive provinces. The paramilitary force grew out of the notorious Janjaweed militias, and rights groups say forces under his command used many of the militias' brutal tactics. ""I signed the list of promotions that I received from you without even looking at it,'' al-Bashir told a cheering crowd, addressing Dagalo, as he stood atop a Land Cruiser in the sweltering heat, according to a contemporary account of the rally. Four years later, al-Bashir is imprisoned in the capital, Khartoum, and Hemedti, who comes from a camel-trading family in a remote province, is the second most powerful man in Sudan. He is the deputy head of the military council that assumed power after removing al-Bashir from office in April, following four months of mass protests. At 44, he is also the youngest member of the council. He says he refused orders from al-Bashir to fire on the protesters, and he praised them as recently as last weekend, saying ``we want the democracy they are talking about.'' Many see him as an ally against the Islamic movement that orchestrated al-Bashir's 1989 coup and underpinned his regime. Hemedti has supplied ground forces to the Saudi-led coalition fighting Iran-aligned rebels in Yemen and can count on the support of the Saudis, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, which also hope to sideline the Islamists. But his meteoric rise is closely linked to the ongoing conflict in his native Darfur, where his forces are accused of continuing the scorched-earth campaign against rebels that al-Bashir launched in 2003, and for which the president was indicted for war crimes and genocide by the International Criminal Court. Hemedti, who declined AP requests for an interview, has not been implicated in the atrocities carried out in Darfur in 2003 and 2004, when the government-backed Janjaweed rampaged across the region, torching villages and killing and raping ethnic Africans. Some 300,000 people were killed and 2.7 million were forcibly displaced in the early years of the conflict, before the violence gradually declined. In an interview with documentary filmmakers in 2008, Hemedti said al-Bashir had personally asked him to lead the campaign against the insurgency in Darfur, but he denied any involvement in attacks on civilians and said he had refused orders to attack civilian areas. Magdi el-Gizouli, a scholar at the Rift Valley Institute, a think tank focused on East Africa, links Hemedti's rise to the military's outsourcing of the conflict to local forces. ""In essence, he is the reason why the rebellion in Darfur was defeated, because he was capable of recruiting an efficient fighting force that knew the local terrain well, that knew the geography well, and that had an ax to grind against farming communities in Darfur,'' he said. The RSF, formed in 2013 and eventually including up to 10,000 fighters, was in some ways an attempt to bring greater discipline to the Arab militias and more closely tie them to the armed forces. Under Hemedti's command, the RSF waged two major counterinsurgency campaigns in Darfur, in 2014 and 2015. A 2015 report by the New York-based Human Rights Watch found that the RSF ``committed a wide range of horrific abuses,'' including forcibly displacing entire communities, destroying wells and plundering livestock. ``Among the most egregious abuses against civilians were torture, extrajudicial killings and mass rapes,'' it said. Witnesses to a 2015 attack by the RSF in Darfur's Jebel Marra region said troops carried out mass rape in and around the village of Golo, often gang-raping women and girls in front of local elders before killing the women and leaving their bodies in the streets, Human Rights Watch said. ""As head of the RSF, Hemedti bears responsibility for the attacks on civilians his forces have carried out, in which civilians have been killed and villages have been burned to the ground,'' Jehanne Henry, a Sudan researcher at Human Rights Watch, said last week. ``The fact that Hemedti is now deputy head of the (transitional military council) is not lost on Darfuris I speak to.'' The International Criminal Court has not brought charges against Hemedti. But it said in a 2014 report that the RSF under his command was ``similar in structure and modus operandi'' to the Janjaweed, with a ``similar pattern of indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks against civilians.'' Hemedti's forces appear to have acquitted themselves better during the protests against his longtime patron al-Bashir, which erupted in December over rising bread prices and rapidly escalated into a popular uprising. He says his forces, like the regular army, refused al-Bashir's orders to violently disperse a sit-in outside the military headquarters in Khartoum established on April 6. The military removed al-Bashir from power five days later, ending a 30-year reign marked by repression and civil war. The protesters have remained in the streets , demanding that the military rapidly hand power over to a civilian government. But while the protesters have forced several officers to resign from the council after complaining they were too close to the former regime, there have not been widespread calls for Hemedti to step down. ""Many people, including some of Sudan's finest democrats, consider him a counterweight to the Islamic movement,'' el-Gizouli said. ``A lot of people in Khartoum would be ready to tolerate him for a while. I'm not sure what they can do once this ends.'' In the weeks since al-Bashir's overthrow, Hemedti has met with Western ambassadors and other envoys in his office in the presidential residence. He has said he has no interest in seeking higher office and has called for a government of technocrats. ""We want a real democracy, fair and free elections,'' he said Saturday. ""Whoever the Sudanese choose will rule.'' But he has also warned the protesters against any further ``chaos,'' hinting late last month that the military may use force if the unrest continues. In Darfur, government forces violently dispersed a rally earlier this month outside a military facility, setting off clashes in which an 18-year-old protester was killed. The protesters in Khartoum have meanwhile expressed mounting frustration with the military council, accusing it of dragging its feet in order to keep much of al-Bashir's regime intact. As tensions escalate, Hemedti's balancing act could prove more challenging. ""Hemedti has been thinking that he is one of the leaders of the change because he was neutral in the protests,'' said Shamayel el-Nour, an activist with the Sudanese Professionals Association, which spearheaded the demonstrations. ""The protesters recognize his refusal to use force against them, but in Darfur he is viewed as a war criminal.''

Prime minister Imran Khan earlier this year said Pakistan would not need to import oil after reserves were found near Karachi coast. ""God willing the reserves will be so large that we will not need to import any oil,"" he said. Special assistant to the prime minister on Petroleum, Nadeem Babar, announced that the offshore drilling in Kekra-1 did not yield desired results, Dawn reported. ""The operators of the well have decided to plug it in the coming days,"" the paper said. Around 17 attempts have been made in the past, but all remained unsuccessful despite encouraging data from each drilling, it said. A senior official of the petroleum division said that after drilling more than 5,500 metres reserves were not found. Therefore, he added, it had been decided to plug the well and abandon the project. Around $100 million has been invested in the project, but the officials of the petroleum division maintain that the data received from the drilling and other seismic studies of the well will be useful for future exploration activities in the region, the paper said. At the same time, the officials say, oil and gas E&P is described as a ""high risk-high reward"" business and the failures should not be taken as a loss. The drilling was initiated around four months back by ENI, an Italian oil and gas exploration and production (E&P) giant, which is the operator of Kekra-1. The other four partners of the well were ExxonMobil of the US — one of the world's largest oil and gas firms — Pakistan Petroleum Limited and the Oil and Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL). ""Based on previous data the prospects were high and at the start of drilling the chances of success were between 13 and 15 per cent, which is fairly good,"" OGDCL spokesman Ahmed Lak said. ""Among the highest prospects of finding the hydrocarbon reserve is 20 per cent, therefore, our record was good enough to proceed with drilling,"" he added. The last offshore activity was conducted by Dutch E&P firm Shell in 2005, but it failed to find hydrocarbon reserves. The first offshore well in Pakistani waters was drilled in 1963 by a US E&P company, the well was found dry.

The two sides have held several rounds of talks since the military overthrew President Omar al-Bashir last month, ending his 30-year reign after four months of mass protests and sit-ins, which are still underway. The deputy head of the military council, Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, better known as Hemedti, meanwhile said late Saturday that security forces have arrested those behind an attack on the protesters last week that killed at least five people, including an army officer. Both the military and the protesters had blamed the attack on al-Bashir loyalists. ``The assailants who opened fire (on protesters) have been caught. Their confessions will be broadcast on TV,'' said Dagalo, who heads the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. He hailed the Forces for the Declaration of Freedom and Change, which represents the protesters, for their role in al-Bashir's military overthrow on April 11. ``We want the democracy they are talking about. We want a real democracy, fair and free elections. Whoever the Sudanese choose will rule,'' he said. The negotiations were suspended Wednesday, just hours after the military and the protesters announced they had agreed on the makeup of an interim parliament and a Cabinet for the transitional period, which is to last three years. The military council had called for the roads outside the sit-in in front of the military's headquarters in Khartoum to be opened. The protesters appear to have agreed to the demand, as the roads were cleared without incident on Thursday. The protesters also agreed to open the railway that crosses the area of the sit-in for five hours a day. The generals and the protesters remain divided on what role the military should have in the transition to civilian rule. Sunday's talks are expected to focus on the makeup of the sovereign council, which would guide the nation through the transition. The Forces for the Declaration of Freedom and Change said it insists on ``limited military representation'' in a sovereign council led by civilians. Saudi Arabia meanwhile announced on Sunday that it had deposited $250 million into Sudan's central bank, part of a package of $3 billion which Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates pledged after al-Bashir's ouster to shore up the economy.

In an audience on Saturday with the Foreign Press Association in Rome, Francis also urged journalists to not fall prey to click-bait headlines and half-reported stories, saying errors can not only misrepresent the truth but damage entire communities. While Francis meets with journalists regularly during his foreign trips, it was the first time a pope has received the Foreign Press Association since St. John Paul II in 1988. Francis kept his distance from the press in his native Argentina. But in the past year, he and his aides have repeatedly praised the role of the media in exposing the clergy abuse scandal and for reporting about the plight of migrants, ""forgotten wars"" and other cases of human suffering. ""We need journalists who are on the side of victims, on the side of those who are persecuted, excluded, thrown away and discriminated against,"" Francis told the roughly 400 journalists and their families in the frescoed Sala Clementina of the Apostolic Palace. ""We need you and your work to not forget so many situations of suffering that often are in the dark, or have light shining for a moment only to return to the darkness of indifference,"" he said. The association's president, Patricia Thomas of The Associated Press, told Francis that more and more journalists are being killed, threatened and imprisoned for merely reporting the news. But she said the threats weren't merely physical. ""Today in many parts of the world, journalists are being discredited daily, accused of spreading fake news that is really just news that people in power don't like,"" she said. ""This process of delegitimization has had a corrosive effect, the dangers of which are obvious."" Francis said a free press was indispensable to guard against authoritarianism. ""Let's not forget that in dictatorships, one of the first things they do is take away the freedom of the press or 'mask' and not allow a free press."" But Francis also urged humility in reporting, saying reporters who think they know everything before they start out aren't doing their job. And he warned against parroting the hatred, vitriol and prejudices in the current public discourse, urging instead calibrated language that respects the dignity of all. Thomas invited Francis to visit the association's headquarters, on the appropriately named Via del'Umilta - Humble Street - and gave him an honorary press card to get in the door.

Australians on Saturday voted to elect their next parliament and prime minister, in what has been widely referred to as the climate-change election. After five weeks long election campaigning across the country, around 16 million Australians swarmed to the polling booths across the country to elect the nation's 31st prime minister. A Nine-Galaxy poll released shortly before the voting stations closed in the east of the country showed a victory for the centre-left Labor party and Liberal Party-led coalition losing its bid for a third three-year term. The poll showed the Labor winning as many as 82 seats in the 151-member House of Representatives, beating the governing Liberal coalition. On Friday, media reports also endorsed Labor Party leader Bill Shorten as the best chance to end a ""cycle of instability"" in Australian politics. To win a majority in the House of Representatives, either major party will need 76 seats. The Coalition currently holds 73 seats, while Labor has 72. Morrison cast his vote at Lilli Pilli Public School in Sydney while Shorten in Melbourne. Defying the exit polls, the early counting recorded a swing in favour of the ruling coalition, which so far won 74 seats, paving the way for Morrison to become the country's 31st prime minister. Opposition Labor Party won 65 seats during the ongoing counting of votes. Following this, Shorten conceded defeat and said he would resign as the party leader. Addressing his disbelieving supports here, he said ""Without wanting to hold out any false hope, while there are still millions of votes to count and important seats yet to be finalised, it is obvious that Labor will not be able to form the next government."" ""I called Scott Morrison to congratulate him... wished him good fortune and good courage in the service of our great nation. The national interest required no less,"" Shorten said. So far, it is not clear whether the Coalition will govern in majority or will need partnership of independent MPs in a minority. According to media reports, the ruling Liberal supporters started an early celebrations at the party headquarters after it became clear that it may form the next government. The Greens, Centre Alliance and other Katter's Australia party has all taken one seat each so far with counting reaching half way. The coalition managed to make significant gains in Queensland and Tasmania and limited its loss in New South Wales and Victoria. Former prime minister Tony Abbott, who once described climate change as ""crap"", lost his seat of Warringah in northern Sydney to independent Zali Steggall, a lawyer and Olympic medallist in Alpine skiing, after suffering a swing of over 13 per cent votes against him. Abbott, conceding his defeat, said ""This is really extraordinary results, it is a stupendous results, it is a great result for Scott Morrison and the rest of the Liberal team, and Scott Morrisson will quite rightly enter the Liberal Pantheon forever."" According to last week's Newspoll survey, even though Labor took the swing in its favour, the leader approval rating favoured Morrison with 45 per cent saying he would make a better prime minister as compared to Shorten. Morrison had wooed voters by saying if re-elected Coalition would deliver a stable economy, more jobs and tax cuts, while promised funds for women's career initiative and domestic violence and conservative plans to deal with climate change. Following the results, Morrison, in his victory speech in Sydney said, ""I have always believed in miracles... for me and for my government, for all of my team it's all about you...tonight is about every single Australian."" ""Our government will get back to work just as Gladys Berejiklian got back to work in New South Wales, just a few months ago,"" he told his supporters. Anger over the government's inaction on climate change is said to prove the real difference between the two parties. Australia has experienced some of the worst effects of climate change in recent few years, from deadly bush fires to the destruction of natural wonders like the Great Barrier Reef. Concern about climate change is now at a 10-year high among Australians, with 64 per cent believing it should be a top priority for the government, according to an Ipsos poll released in April. The Labor party is promising to cut Australia's carbon emissions by 45 per cent on 2005 levels, compared to the government's minimum pledge of 26 per cent. The poll comes just two days after the death of Bob Hawke, a long-serving former prime minister whose achievements have been hailed across the political spectrum. Australia has compulsory voting and a complex system of ballots ranked by voter preference. The political, economic and cultural differences varies from state to state on the vast island-continent.

The bill had been amended late last year to ensure that it would not impact the right of the British Sikh community to possess and supply kirpans, or religious swords. ""We have engaged closely with the Sikh community on the issue of kirpans. As a result, we have amended the Bill to ensure that the possession and supply of large kirpans for religious reasons can continue,"" a UK Home Office spokesperson said. The All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for British Sikhs had led a delegation to the UK Home Office to ensure that the kirpan remains exempt when the new bill becomes law. ""I am pleased to see the government amendment...which reflects the importance of not criminalising the Sikh community for the sale or possession of large kirpans,"" said Labour MP Preet Kaur Gill, chair of the APPG for British Sikhs. The new law would therefore maintain status quo in continuing to legally safeguard the sale, possession and use of large kirpans. Fellow Sikh MP, Tan Dhesi, had also made an intervention during the Offensive Weapons Bill debate in the Commons to seek ""assurances about the kirpan, given the Sikh community's serious concerns"". Large kirpans, with blades over 50-cm, are used by the community during religious ceremonies in gurudwaras as well as for ceremonies involving the traditional Sikh Gatka martial art. They would have fallen foul of the new bill on the possession of large blades without the amendment, which has now been agreed. The Offensive Weapons Act covers new offences around possession of certain offensive weapons in public and enforces new restrictions on the online sales of bladed articles and corrosive products in attempt to crackdown on rising knife and acid-related attacks in the country. ""These new laws will give police extra powers to seize dangerous weapons and ensure knives are less likely to make their way onto the streets in the first place. The Act will also see the introduction of Knife Crime Prevention Orders - a power the police called for,"" said UK Home Secretary Sajid Javid. The act is aimed at strengthening existing legislative measures on offensive weapons, focusing on corrosive substances, knives and certain types of firearm. It brings in new laws to ban the sale of corrosive substances to anyone under the age of 18, to target people carrying acid, to make it more difficult for anyone under the age of 18 to buy knives online and to ban certain types of firearms.

After five weeks long election campaigning across the country, around 16 million Australians swarmed to the polling booths across the country to elect the nation's prime minister. A Nine-Galaxy poll released shortly before the voting stations closed in the east of the country showed a victory for the centre-left Labor party and Liberal Party-led coalition losing its bid for a third three-year term. The poll showed the Labor winning as many as 82 seats in the 151-member House of Representatives, beating the governing Liberal coalition. To win a majority in the House of Representatives, either major party will need 77 seats. The Coalition currently holds 73 seats, while Labor has 72. Some 16.5 million Australians were enrolled to vote on Saturday, with more than 4.7 million having already cast ballots in early voting by Friday. Prime Minister Scott Morrison cast his vote at Lilli Pilli Public School in Sydney while Labor party leader Bill Shorten cast his vote in Melbourne. Morrison said this federal election was a “choice about who you want to continue to be the Prime Minister of this country, myself or Bill Shorten”. “Tonight the votes will be counted and we will see what the outcome is. I make no assumptions about tonight. I respect this process. It is dear to my heart, the democracy of our country. I don't take anyone's support in this country for granted,” Morrison said. Shorten after casting his vote said, ""Today, vote for change, vote for real change, and vote for Labor. Vote to stop the chaos. Today, vote to stop the cuts to schools and hospitals. For a better childcare system for families. Vote to tackle climate change. Vote Labor.” Hitting out on climate change, Shorten said it “wasn't the Aussie way” to be “missing from the big fights. We will convene the parliament as soon as possible to start action on climate change."" Anger over the government's inaction on climate change may prove the real difference between the two parties. Australia has experienced some of the worst effects of climate change in recent few years, from deadly bush fires to the destruction of natural wonders like the Great Barrier Reef. Concern about climate change is now at a 10-year high among Australians, with 64 per cent believing it should be a top priority for the government, according to an Ipsos poll released in April. The Labor party is promising to cut Australia's carbon emissions by 45 per cent on 2005 levels, compared to the government's minimum pledge of 26 per cent. Meanwhile, Labor lodged an official complaint against Liberal for allegedly using Australian Election Commission (AEC) colours and telling voters to use their first choice in front of a Liberal candidate in Melbourne seat of Chisholm. However, AEC responded that the signs were not a breach of electoral rules because they appeared to be properly authorised and there is nothing in the Electoral Act regarding use of colour. The poll comes just two days after the death of Bob Hawke, a long-serving former prime minister whose achievements have been hailed across the political spectrum.

"69382665"|"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/veggie-eggs-are-coming-to-your-breakfast-table/articleshow/69382665.cms"|"[Bloomberg]"|"Egg whites are universally accepted as a healthy source of protein. But because they come from chickens, one could worry about animal welfare, the environmental damage wrought by industrial poultry and even Salmonella — since the Food and Drug Administration estimates that 79,000 Americans are sickened by tainted eggs every year. Or maybe you’re just a vegetarian. Regardless, the way to solve all of these problems is to just make “eggs” from plants. The market for such egg alternatives is officially blowing up. But toppling real eggs isn’t going to be easy. Egg whites (the real kind) have long been the protein people refuse to do without because it’s seen as irreplaceable. Egg whites are the most efficient and allergen-light source of protein when compared with rivals such as whey, soy and pea. Moreover, food manufacturers rely on eggs because they add natural protein that’s flavourless and highly soluble. The dominant player in the non-egg space is Just Inc., a $1 billion enterprise. It launched its own liquid egg substitute late last year, one made primarily from protein derived from mung beans. The company said it has sold the plant-based equivalent of 6.3 million chicken eggs in the US to date — but there’s still a long way to go. CEO Josh Tetrick said the company has signed partnership agreements with major chicken egg suppliers that will manufacture and distribute Just Egg. The companies, he said, will build factory lines separate from where they process real eggs. Tetrick said he plans to expand into Europe later this year and eventually Asia. Unsurprisingly, finding a popular consumer alternative to real eggs is what many in this sector consider true north. But for now, said Michele Simon, executive director of the Plant Based Foods Association, food service is the key to enacting real change. “There are ways to quietly replace eggs in the food supply,” said Simon, whose group has grown from 22 company members to 140 since its founding three years ago. “Most people don’t care as long as their cake is bouncy. You can change up an ingredient and it will be mostly invisible to consumers.” But shifting consumer habits takes time. Egg Beaters, the leading liquid egg brand on the market, said the entire industry is about to pivot. “The world has changed. Eggs have been viewed as a villain — not good, with lots of cholesterol. That’s how Egg Beaters was created,” said Bob Nolan, senior vice president of demand science at Conagra Brands, its parent company. “But then, in the last 10 years, it’s no longer a villain but celebrated.” There is one more obstacle ahead for egg substitutes. Many of the product’s natural constituents aren’t big fans of processed food. By definition, fake eggs are processed food. “Consumers want new and healthy foods,” said Peter Rahal, co-founder of protein bar maker Rxbar. “A lot of times, the ingredient deck might not look healthy or clean. There’s a tension between food science and consumers wanting healthy, heirloom and local.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."|"‘Veggie eggs’ are coming to your breakfast table"|"Sat May 18 10:43:00 CEST 2019"|"[world]"

She was 7. The cat, who was originally named Tardar Sauce and hailed from Arizona, died after complications arose from a urinary tract infection, her family wrote on Twitter. Grumpy Cat first rose to prominence six years ago, after her owner posted a photo to Reddit, captioned “Meet grumpy cat.” The sourpuss with the piercing look of contempt quickly became a meme, and placing bold words above and below her frown became a common way for humans to express grumpy thoughts. Grumpy Cat’s visage was named Meme of the Year at the 2013 Webby Awards, beating out “Gangnam Style” and “Harlem Shake.” Her likeness appeared on nearly 900 items in an official shop, she made a television advertisement and became the official “spokescat” of a cat food brand. She starred in a movie, she was on the cover of New York Magazine, and her book hit No. 7 on The New York Times’ advice, how-to and miscellaneous best-seller list. Estimates ranged widely on how much Grumpy Cat was worth, though Bundesen disputed a 2014 report that the cat had earned her $100 million. On the cat’s website, her owners maintain that Grumpy Cat wasn’t grumpy at all. “She is a super cute and cuddly kitty and loves to be held and rubbed,” they wrote.

Mohammad Javad Zarif met Friday with Wang Yi, whose country has been a major customer for Iranian oil, at the Diaoyutai state guesthouse. ""We consider (China) one of our closest partners in the world,"" Zarif said in opening remarks at the start of the meeting. Iran wishes to cooperate with China ""bilaterally and multilaterally, in order to preserve the interests of our two peoples ... for peace and security,"" Zarif said. Wang told Zarif during the meeting that China hopes the Iran nuclear deal can be ""fully implemented."" ""China firmly opposes unilateral sanctions and the so-called `long-arm' jurisdiction imposed by the United States on Iran,"" Wang said, according to China's Xinhua state news agency. The Chinese foreign minister pledged to maintain the nuclear deal and work with Iran to eliminate ""complicated disturbing factors,"" Xinhua said. Along with ratcheting-up pressure on the Islamic Republic, Washington is engaged in an increasingly bitter tariff battle with China. Wang's comments were inaudible, but China has accused the U.S. of raising tensions in the Middle East with its more assertive approach to Iran, as well as upsetting energy markets and the global economy. The talks came after Saudi Arabia accused Iran of being behind a drone attack that shut down a key oil pipeline in the kingdom. A local newspaper linked to the Al Saud royal family called Thursday for America to launch ""surgical strikes"" on Tehran. The U.S. has also dispatched warships and bombers to the region to counter an alleged threat from Iran that has seen America order nonessential diplomatic staff out of Iraq. President Donald Trump decided last year to withdraw the U.S. from the 2015 nuclear accord between Iran and world powers and imposed wide-reaching sanctions that have crippled Iran's economy. Zarif arrived following a visit to Japan — like China, a major importer of crude oil from the Persian Gulf — as part of intense diplomatic efforts to salvage Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers at the center of a crisis unfolding between Iran and the U.S. Zarif was quoted by Iran's official IRNA news agency as chastising the international community, saying in Beijing that it has ""mainly made statements, instead of saving the deal."" After Trump pulled America out of the deal, other signatories — the European Union, France, Britain, China, Russia and Germany — have been trying to salvage it. Iran recently warned it would resume enriching uranium at higher levels if a new deal isn't reached by July 7.

"69384002"|"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/german-far-right-rules-digital-campaign-for-europe-election/articleshow/69384002.cms"|"[AP]"|"BERLIN: The best polls put the far-right Alternative for Germany at less than 15 percent of the vote one week before European elections . But with their relentless Facebook messages, tweets and other social media posts, they're dominating the other parties online. Like other right-wing parties in Europe, the party known as AfD is taking a page out of US President Donald Trump's playbook, skirting a traditional media campaign to focus on a provocative social media effort that has prompted more shares and chatter than anyone else. The key question, though, is whether it can turn the internet buzz into actual votes. ""As the first Facebook party of Germany, the AfD knew from the very beginning how to activate and mobilize their fans,'' digital expert Martin Fuchs told The Associated Press. ""Thousands of fans make sure the party's content is spread widely and creates a buzz and attention at least within the AfD bubble.'' Trump's nontraditional strategy has proven a model for many populist parties in Europe. Italy's Matteo Salvini streams videos of his appearances on Facebook and debates issues on Twitter; Marine Le Pen in France has 2.2 million Twitter followers and her party created a unit devoted to social media campaigning for France's 2017 presidential election, in which she made it to the runoff. The AfD wouldn't discuss its strategy in detail, but the most successful posts seem to take a kernel of real news and then exaggerate it to raise online indignance and promote the conservative nationalist platform. On Twitter, its members are lashing out against the traditional mainstream parties by falsely claiming Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats want to ban YouTube. On Facebook, they warn, also inaccurately that Merkel's government coalition partner, the Social Democrats, will expropriate private homes. And on all social media platforms, they stoke fears of migrants and Islam. Earlier this month they capitalized on a report in the conservative tabloid press that Mohammed had become the most popular baby name in Berlin true if you count middle names, but otherwise not. With a photo of a toddler sporting a crudely photoshopped thick black beard, the Berlin AfD tweeted ""Mohammed is now the most popular name,'' and asked, ""Berlin: Islamization is not happening?'' That post was eventually taken down but not before it sparked wide-ranging uproar and discussion. And after a report that an asylum-seeker threw a dog out a window, the AfD posted on Facebook a picture of a Golden Retriever puppy captioned: ""Mutilated, burned, raped: Dogs perish for radical Islam.'' The post was shared 7,000 times and received 2,800 comments. Currently, the AfD is polling at around 10-13% for the upcoming election, up from 7.1% in the 2014 European election. But 47% of the most frequently used terms in online political discussions were linked to the AfD in a study by Alto Data Analysis. In an interview with the AP earlier this month, AfD co-leader Alice Weidel downplayed the poll figures, noting that mainstream pundits had underestimated Trump's chances of winning right up to election day. But the other parties are not rolling over and playing dead in the face of the AfD's social media dominance. The Greens, for example, had one person who took care of two social media accounts during the last European elections. This time, it's four staffers overseeing 14 accounts, double the budget for the media campaign, and all their party members, candidates and elected politicians are encouraged to be digitally active. They've also got a so-called ``rapid response team'' of around 4,000 online-savvy supporters who can be activated to ""jump into the debates and discredit false statements'' when the party is attacked by others on social media, the press office of the Green Party told the AP. Christian Lindner, the leader of the pro-business Free Democrats, is a prolific tweeter and was one of the first major German politicians to embrace the platform. For this election, the party has ramped up its online operation with a budget of 300,000 euros ($337,000 dollars) compared with 47,300 euros in 2014. Likewise, Merkel's junior coalition partner Social Democrats say they have increased their budget 80-fold over the previous European election, where they spent only 20,000 euros. Merkel herself does not tweet, and made a splash earlier this year by saying she was giving up her Facebook page as well, despite 2.5 million likes. Her spokesman, Steffen Seibert, does tweet regularly, as does the party and many of its other leaders. The CDU did not respond to several requests for comment on their social media efforts for the European elections. The AfD's national press office said that ``social media are important for us, however, their influence on the elections is not measurable.'' The party did not want to share further details on its election strategy, but a spokesman for the AfD's Berlin branch, Ronald Glaeser, said using social media was the best way for the party to bypass traditional media. Fuchs, the digital expert, who teaches at several German universities and founded the social media analysis platform pluragraf.de, said his research suggests the AfD's skillful digital campaigning will not translate into too much of a gain at the polls. He noted that in Germany, studies show entire election campaigns usually only impact about 2-3% of the vote's result. The AfD has seen little or no growth in its Facebook fans in recent months, he said. ""My impression is that the AfD's potential to mobilize via digital communication is immensely overrated,'' Fuchs said.""`They're mobilizing inside their bubble but only there.'' Simon Hegelich, a professor for political data science at Munich's Technical University, tends to agree. ""It's not easy, often even impossible, to influence voters via social media,'' Hegelich told the AP. ""All studies so far imply that nobody changes their political opinion radically just because he reads something on the internet.''

Both the Mahanayake Theras deeply appreciated India's unconditional and strong support for Sri Lanka including in the security sphere, it said. Indian authorities shared intelligence with Sri Lanka before the serial blasts rocked the neighbouring country. However, Sri Lankan authorities failed to act on the intelligence inputs. Nine suicide bombers, including a woman, carried out a series of devastating blasts that tore through three churches and three luxury hotels, killing 258 people and injuring over 500 others. Authorities earlier said they believed a little-known local militant Islamist group known as National Tawheed Jamath (NTJ) was behind the attack. However, the NTJ has not claimed responsibility for the attacks, Sri Lanka's worst. The Islamic State terror group said it had carried out the attacks, and released video of men it says were the bombers.

On Friday, a federal judge in Oakland, California, will consider arguments in two cases that seek to block the White House from spending Defense and Treasury Department money for wall construction. California and 19 other states brought one lawsuit; the Sierra Club and Southern Border Communities Coalition, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, brought the other. On Thursday, a federal judge in the nation's capital will consider a bid by the US House of Representatives to prevent Trump from spending any Defense Department money for a border wall. At stake is billions of dollars that would allow Trump to make major progress on a signature campaign promise heading into his campaign for a second term. The president's adversaries say the emergency declaration was an illegal attempt to ignore Congress, which authorized far less wall spending than Trump wanted. Trump grudgingly accepted congressional approval of $1.375 billion to end a 35-day government shutdown on Feb. 15 but declared an emergency in almost the same breath. The White House says it has identified up to $8.1 billion that it could spend. Trump's actions ""amount to a usurpation of Congress' legislative powers in violation of bedrock separation of powers principles embedded in the Constitution,"" the state attorneys general wrote. The administration argues that the president is protecting national security interests as unprecedented numbers of Central American asylum-seeking families arrive at the US border with Mexico. ""The increasing surge of migrants, the highest in over a decade, has placed a tremendous strain on the limited resources of the Department of Homeland Security and exacerbated the risks to border security, public safety, and the safety of the migrants themselves,"" the Justice Department said in a court filing. The courtroom showdowns come amid a flurry of activity to accelerate wall construction. Kenneth Rapuano, an assistant secretary of defense, said in a court filing last month that work on the highest-priority, Pentagon-funded projects — in Yuma, Arizona, and in New Mexico — could begin as soon as May 25. The Defense Department transferred $1 billion to border wall coffers in March and another $1.5 billion last week. Patrick Shanahan, the acting defense secretary, may decide as soon as Wednesday whether to transfer an additional $3.6 billion. Last month, the Army Corps of Engineers awarded a $789 million contract to SLSCO Ltd. of Galveston, Texas, to replace 46 miles (74 kilometers) of barrier in New Mexico, paid for by Pentagon funds. On Wednesday, Barnard Construction Co. of Bozeman, Montana, won a $141.8 million contract to replace 5 miles (8 kilometers) in Yuma and 15 miles (24 kilometers) in the Border Patrol's El Centro, California, sector. Southwest Valley Constructors of Albuquerque, New Mexico, won a $646 million contract to replace 63 miles (101 kilometers) in the Border Patrol's Tucson, Arizona, sector. All of those projects are funded by the Defense Department, with construction expected to begin in as little as 45 days. Also this week, the Department of Homeland Security waived environmental impact and other reviews to replace wall in California and Arizona under a law that gives the secretary sweeping powers to spec construction. The environmental waivers cover a 15-mile (24-kilometer) replacement in El Centro that is funded by the Homeland Security Department's 2018 appropriations and was awarded in a contract to SLSCO last year. The administration said construction could begin on that project as early as Saturday. Aside from California, states participating in the legal challenge are Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Wisconsin.

A 10-member delegation, led by finance secretary Mohammad Younas Dagha, attended the two-day meeting of the Asia-Pacific Group (APG) of the Paris-based FATF in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou where it defended Pakistan's efforts against money laundering and terror financing. According to a Dawn report, some participants, particularly those from India, raised very tough questions about Pakistan's seriousness to act against proscribed organisations and effectiveness of internal controls. On May 3, finance minister Arun Jaitley said India will ask the FATF to put Pakistan on a blacklist of countries that fail to meet international standards in stopping financial crime. The APG will submit to the FATF its analysis of the compliance report submitted by Pakistan at the meeting, which concluded yesterday, and the progress made since the group's on-site inspection in Islamabad and Karachi in March, the report said. The APG report will become the basis for the FATF to decide whether to exclude Pakistan from its grey list or not. The delegation briefed the meeting about Pakistan's updated actions against currency smuggling, proscribed organisations and tightening of financial and corporate sector systems and operational effectiveness, the report said. Giving examples of the measures taken by it, Pakistan cited arrests of key operatives of some proscribed outfits, putting more such groups and their affiliates in the list of banned outfits, blocking their accounts and financial flows and taking control of their assets. In March, bowing down to international pressure, Pakistan launched a major crackdown on Jaish-e-Muhammed, Jamat-ud-Dawa, Falah-i-Insaniyat Foundation and other banned outfits and took over the control of their assets throughout the country. The Pakistan delegation said the country was very close to accomplish the milestones set under the FATF action plan well before the September deadline. It also said the government recently revised its national risk assessment of the corporate sector, strengthened customs procedures on borders and inland movement of funds and assets. Besides, internal control of the banking and non-banking financial institutions, insurance companies and stock exchanges has been strengthened to curb the possibility of money laundering and terror financing. The delegation cited the creation of a specialised directorate of Cross-Border Currency Movement (CBCM) in Islamabad to maintain a database of currency seizures. The APG had earlier flashed contradictory situations and poor coordination among stakeholders, including law enforcement agencies, in fighting money laundering and terror financing in Pakistan. Last month, it expressed serious reservations over insufficient physical actions on ground against proscribed organisations to block flow of funds and activities.

Cairo airport officials said on Friday the Sudanese were arrested earlier this month in the western coastal city of Marsa Matruh, not far from Libya's border, along with dozens of Egyptians and other African nationals. The officials say the migrants had planned to take fishing boats from the Libyan port of Zuwarah to Italy.

A three-judge panel of the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2 to 1 that the Trump administration violated federal statute when it tried to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) programme without adequately explaining why. The ruling overturns a lower court ruling a judge in Maryland made last year, which Trump had previously praised via Twitter. Friday's ruling will not have any immediate effect as other federal courts have already ordered that DACA be kept in place. The 4th Circuit ruling said the Department of Homeland Security did not ""adequately account'' for how ending DACA program would affect the hundreds of thousands of young people who ""structured their lives'' around the program. ""This ruling is the result of a long and valiant battle that our Dreamers have endured in their struggle to keep their families together,'' said Lizette Olmos, a spokeswoman for Casa de Maryland, the lead plaintiff in the case. Trump and his Justice Department have argued that the Obama administration acted unlawfully when it implemented DACA. The Justice Department did not immediately return a request for comment. Preserving DACA is a top Democratic priority, but discussions between Trump and Democrats on the issue have gone nowhere. Trump's latest immigration plan, unveiled on Thursday, does not address what to do about the hundreds of thousands of young immigrants brought to the US as children. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters that ""every single time that we have put forward or anyone else has put forward any type of immigration plan that has included DACA it's failed.'' DACA's fate could be decided by the Supreme Court, which is weighing the Trump administration's appeals of other federal court rulings. The justices have set no date to take action. If the high court decides it wants to hear the appeals, arguments would not take place before the fall. That means a decision is not expected until 2020, which could come in the thick of next year's presidential contest.

'Victoria: Woman and Crown' opens at Kensington Palace in London next Friday, 200 years since her birth on May 24, 1819 at the same palace as Princess Victoria. ""Her complex love affair with India will form one of the central themes, from the forced Anglicisation of a deposed Maharaja (Duleep Singh) in the 1850s to her personal appointment of an Indian Secretary (Abdul Karim) in 1888,"" Historic Royal Palaces said in a statement, announcing the bicentenary exhibition. As the former ruler of the Sikh Empire, deposed during the Anglo-Sikh wars with the annexation of Punjab under Maharaja Ranjit Singh, his son Maharaja Duleep Singh was exiled to Britain, where he was first introduced to Queen Victoria at Buckingham Palace. After this meeting, the Queen described the young Maharajah in her journal as ""16 & extremely handsome...(he) has a pretty, graceful & dignified manner. He was beautifully dressed & covered with diamonds"". The meeting is believed to have kicked off a lifelong interest in Singh and his family, with Victoria acting as godmother to his daughter Sophia, and offering his children ""grace and favour"" accommodation at Hampton Court Palace following his death. ""Examples of the Maharajah's opulent wardrobe go on display at Kensington Palace for the first time, alongside a portrait of Duleep Singh commissioned by Victoria from one of her favourite artists,"" noted Historic Royal Palaces. The other Indian connect explored as part of the exhibition is the role played by Victoria's Indian servant Abdul Karim, on whom the Queen bestowed the title of ""Munshi"" or teacher. Their close friendship has been captured in 'Victoria and Abdul: The Extraordinary True Story of the Queen's Closest Confidant' by London-based author Shrabani Basu and was recently also adapted for the screen with Dame Judi Dench taking on the role of Queen Victoria. Under the Munshi's tutelage, the monarch learned to read and write Urdu and one of her diaries carefully inscribed in the language form one of the star items of the display, set alongside items showcasing Victoria's relationship with her Empire. Polly Putnam, exhibition curator at Historic Royal Palaces, said: ""Although considered one of the most famous women in history, Queen Victoria's personality, passions and politics remain little known. ""To mark the 200th anniversary of her birth at Kensington Palace, this year we'll be re-examining the life of this fascinating and contradictory monarch, whose cultural legacy and impact on world affairs are still felt to this day."" The new display, alongside a tour of the rooms the Queen inhabited as a young girl at Kensington Palace, is aimed at exploring the private woman behind the public monarch, and re-examine Victoria's later life and legacy. As the birthplace of the Victorian era, Kensington Palace played a central role in the shaping of the monarch. It was at Kensington that Victoria spent her formative years under the gaze of her ever-present mother the Duchess of Kent, and it was in her apartment at the palace that she went to bed a princess and woke up a queen. As the head of an ever-growing family, Victoria had the unique challenge of balancing the role of wife and mother with that of Queen of an expanding empire. The exhibition will also assess her power and influence, and how she carefully curated her own public image. As the most famous woman in the world at the dawn of the photographic age, Victoria understood and consciously harnessed this new technology, using it both to project an image of Imperial power across continents and document the minutia of family life. Similarly, the display will consider how her organisation of the marriages of her nine children – and those of her 42 grandchildren – into the ruling families of Europe marked a deliberate exercise in shaping dynastic politics across the European continent, and earned her the nickname ""the Grandmother of Europe"". Victoria's long reign also saw the birth of four future kings. A poignant portrait of her with her son, grandson and great-grandson (the future Edward VII, George V and Edward VIII respectively) will go on display, reunited with the delicately embroidered black bodice Victoria wore when sitting for the artist. With the death of her husband Albert in 1861, Victoria adopted a wardrobe of black gowns as a potent and public symbol of her grief. Responding to this central theme of loss, a specially commissioned installation created by artist Jane Wildgoose titled 'In Sorrow Shut' will consider the enduring symbolism of Victoria's widowhood. Rare survivals from Victoria's private wardrobe will go on display at Kensington Palace for the first time – including a simple cotton petticoat dated to around the time of her marriage, and a fashionable pair of silver boots recently acquired by Historic Royal Palaces with support from Art Fund – providing a stark contrast to the exquisitely made, black satin gowns she was so famous for wearing Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."|"India a central theme of new Queen Victoria exhibition in UK"|"Fri May 17 21:42:00 CEST 2019"|"[world]"

Concerns about a possible conflict have flared since the White House ordered warships and bombers to the region to counter an alleged, unexplained threat from Iran that has seen America order nonessential diplomatic staff out of Iraq. Elsewhere, authorities have said that a sabotage operation targeted four oil tankers on Sunday off the coast of the United Arab Emirates, and Iran-aligned rebels in Yemen claimed responsibility for a drone attack Tuesday on a crucial Saudi oil pipeline. Saudi Arabia directly blamed Iran for the drone assault, and a local newspaper linked to the Al Saud royal family called on Thursday for America to launch ""surgical strikes'' on Tehran. This all takes root in President Donald Trump's decision last year to withdraw the US from the 2015 nuclear accord between Iran and world powers and impose wide-reaching sanctions. But Trump took a soft tone Thursday, a day after tweeting that he expected Iran to look for talks. Asked if the U.S. might be on a path to war with the Iranians, the president answered, ``I hope not.'' Iranian officials remain skeptical. Imposing sanctions while seeking talks is like ""pointing a gun at someone and demanding friendship,'' said Iranian Gen. Rasool Sanaeirad, according to the semi-official Mehr news agency. On Friday, Zarif arrived in Beijing to speak to his Chinese counterpart. China was one of the signatories on Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which saw it limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of crushing economic sanctions. ""So far, the international community has mainly made statements instead of saving the deal,'' Zarif said, according to a report by the state-run IRNA news agency. ""The practical step is quite clear: Economic relations with Iran should be normalized. This is what the deal clearly addresses.'' Zarif earlier visited Japan, a major importer of crude oil from the Persian Gulf. Iran recently said it would resume enriching uranium at higher levels if a new nuclear deal is not reached with Europe by July 7. That would potentially bring it closer to being able to develop a nuclear weapon, something Iran insists it has never sought.

Anti-Muslim riots have killed one person and caused extensive damage to homes, businesses and mosques in Sri Lanka this week. The communal violence is a fresh backlash from the Easter Sunday attacks where nine suicide bombers, including a woman, carried out a series of devastating blasts that tore through three churches and three luxury hotels, killing 258 people and injuring over 500 others. ""Those who attack Muslims only fulfil the agenda of extremist militants. Terrorist want other communities to target Muslims. They wanted to divide us,"" Imtiaz Bakeer Markar, a senior Muslim politician told reporters.

She said the Muslim community had volunteered to give information to security forces in their operations to nab the extremists. ""Please do not push them towards divisive groups by attacking them,"" Ashraff said.

Earlier, a group of opposition legislators moved a motion in Parliament for a vote of no trust against Industry and Trade Minister Rishath Bathiyutheen who leads a small Muslim party, a coalition partner in the government, for alleged complicity with the jihadists.

It will take “necessary measures” to safeguard the interests of the Chinese company, the Chinese foreign ministry said. China also slapped formal charges of spying on two Canadian citizens who have been under detention for several weeks. The move follows Canada’s decision to detain a senior executive of Huawei on charges of illegal transactions. The Trump administration barred Huawei, the world’s biggest telecom company, from receiving components from US exporters without a licence. It also issued an executive order that begins the process of banning the company from selling in the US. The move might delay Huawei’s plans to roll out 5G technology, an area where it is ahead of its international competitors. China has asked its businesses to comply with laws and regulations in export control, abide by local laws and fulfil their international obligations while operating in foreign countries, foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said. “But we are against other countries’ unilateral sanctions based on domestic law and practices that abuse export control measures,” he said, adding, “We urge the US to stop such practices and create favourable conditions for business cooperation. China will take necessary measures to safeguard Chinese business’ legitimate rights and interests”. China will not use the retaliatory path punishing American companies, he said. “As for the foreign firms, so long as their operations are lawful, they should not be concerned. In international trade, the basis is mutual respect and mutual benefit,” Lu said. Huawei reacted, saying, “Restricting Huawei from doing business in the US will not make the US more secure or stronger; instead, this will only serve to limit the US to inferior yet more expensive alternatives”. The telecom giant added, ""In addition, unreasonable restrictions will infringe upon Huawei’s rights and raise other serious legal issues”. One of the Canadian citizens to face formal charges is Michael Kovrig, a former diplomat who has been charged with “gathering state secrets and intelligence for abroad”. The second one is a business consultant, Michael Spavor, who has been accused of “stealing and providing state secrets for abroad,” Lu said. Earlier, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had criticized the initial detentions, describing them as arbitrary and “politically motivated”.

For India, the proposed changes, which have to meet legislative approval to become law, could mean a significant transformation in the kind of people who can immigrate to the US: Educated, English-speaking aspirants with specific skills, job offers, and ability to assimilate into American culture will get preference over those who immigrate merely on the basis of sponsorship from spouses, siblings, and even cousins. The proposals are the work of President Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and is said to be backed enthusiastically by the President. But early previews of the proposed changes, which Trump is scheduled to unveil in a White House event later on Thursday, suggest they would not get congressional approval because it displeases too many lawmakers in both Republican and Democratic ranks. For one, the middle-of-the-road proposals do not envisage a net decrease in immigration, as demanded by Trump’s hardline nativist constituency, or even a reduction in Green Cards, the permanent residency permit that typically paves way to citizenship. On the other hand, it does not also address issues of more than 11 million undocumented workers, including two million the so-called “Dreamers” (people brought into he US as children), a major Democratic demand. Many lawmakers and immigration activists — both for and against — were visibly underwhelmed by the proposals and some of them pronounced it “dead on arrival,” saying it will never pass Congress. Congress was not able to pass immigration reform laws even during the two terms of President Barack Obama and George Bush when the political atmosphere was less toxic and there was greater bipartisanship. But should Trump put his shoulder to the wheel and somehow get the proposals through Congress, it will fundamentally alter the immigrant mix coming to the United States. The US current issues more than 1 million green cards each year granting foreigners legal permanent residency (which typically leads to citizenship), of which about 140,000 (12 per cent) are based on employment and the rest on family ties, refugees status, and a diversity lottery. Under the Kushner proposal, those numbers would be broadly reversed, with nearly 60 percent of all visas going to immigrants with particular skills or offers of employment. The change would increase the overall education level of immigrants, attracting foreign graduates and those with advanced degrees, and increase the current average salary for immigrants from $43,000 to $ 96,000. This would effectively bump up US tax collection and revenues and underwrite the expenses of its demographic aging. For India, it could also mean losing more of its best and the brightest, many of who chose to bolt for greener pastures citing lack of opportunity and a debilitating ecosystem at home. It will also be a blow to the constituency that flees India by seeking asylum by claiming persecution and those who immigrate through the family ties route.

The new definition proposed by a cross-party group of parliamentarians explicitly states that “denying Muslim populations the right to self-determination, e.g. by claiming that the existence of an independent Palestine or Kashmir is a terrorist endeavour” would be considered an Islamophobic crime in Britain. The APPG on British Muslims, of which Indian-origin Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi MP is a vice-chair, published the report, titled “Islamophobia Defined”, in December calling for a new definition of Islamophobia. “Islamophobia is rooted in racism and is a type of racism that targets expressions of Muslimness or perceived Muslimness,” the report said. The group said it was required as Islamophobia was widespread in Britain. The APPG aims to celebrate the contributions of Muslim communities to Britain and to investigate prejudice against them. But assistant commissioner Neil Basu, head of counter-terrorism policing, said the definition risked “representing what some might see as legitimate criticism of the tenets of Islam — a religion — as a racist hate crime, which cannot be right for a liberal democracy in which free speech is also a core value. This definition risks shutting down debate about any interpretation of the tenets of Islam which are at odds with our laws and customs, which in turn would place our police officers and members of the judicial system in an untenable position.” “It would potentially allow those investigated by police and the security services for promoting extremism, hate and terrorism to legally challenge any investigation and potentially undermine many elements of counter-terrorism powers and policies on the basis that they are ‘Islamophobic’.” The explanatory note in the report gives examples of what would count as Islamophobia under the new definition, including “claiming Muslims spread Islam by the sword or subjugate minority groups under their rule, or characterising Muslims as being sex groomers, inherently violent or incapable of living harmoniously in plural societies.” Other examples given are of “holding Muslims collectively responsible for the actions of any Muslim majority state… Making … stereotypical allegations about Muslims such as … the myth of Muslim identity having a unique propensity for terrorism, and claims of a demographic threat posed by Muslims or a ‘Muslim takeover’.” More than 40 Sikh, Hindu, Christian, secular and ex-Muslim academics, experts and peers sent an open letter to UK home secretary Sajid Javid on Wednesday saying the new definition was unfit for purpose, threatened civil liberties, that it “had negative consequences for freedom of expression” and allegations of Islamophobia would “shield extremists from criticism”. The letter said the new definition would “shut down legitimate criticism and investigation” and accusations of Islamophobia were already being used against anyone in Britain who opposed the hijab or Muslim views on homosexuality. “Activities which promote ideas contrary to British values are far more likely to go unreported,” the letter states. It was signed by a range of leading organisations, including the Network of Sikh Organisations, the Hindu Forum of Britain, Hindu Forum of Europe, Hindu Council of North, Hindu Council of Birmingham, as well as the British Pakistani Christian Association, Sikh Media Monitoring Group and National Council of Hindu Temples. “We must be free to talk about grooming gangs and the negative aspects of Mughal history in India, which do include chapters in which Islam spread by the sword and subjugated minority groups under its rule. The danger is this definition will criminalise such discussions, and that’s a retrograde step for hard-fought freedoms in this country, and furthermore, it could give legally sanctioned cover to extremist activity,” Lord Singh, director, Network of Sikh Organisations, told TOI. “Sikhs could especially find themselves on the wrong side of the law if they discuss the martyrdom of Guru Arjan or Guru Tegh Bahadur.” Communities secretary James Brokenshire said he welcomed a new definition of Islamophobia but instead announced the appointment of two experts to work closely with a cross-government working group to “ensure wide-ranging acceptance”. The new wording has, however, been accepted by Labour, the Liberal Democrats, Scottish political parties, some local councils and Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London. The APPG on British Muslims counts numerous Pakistani-origin MPs and peers among its parliamentary members, including Lord Nazir Ahmed, who is due to stand trial for sexual offences against children at Sheffield Crown Court in December. Lead Commissioner for Countering Extremism Sara Khan, who is Muslim, said: “The APPG definition fails to acknowledge the hate faced by minorities within minorities — such as LGBTQ+ Muslims, the Ahmadiyya community… Secondly, an ambiguous definition may have the unintended consequence of making it impossible to expose and challenge Islamist extremism.” She said the word “Islamophobe” was already being slung at people to “shut down legitimate debate on Islamist extremism and vital counter-extremism work”. National Police Chiefs’ Council chair Martin Hewitt said: “We are concerned that the definition … could cause confusion for officers enforcing it and could be used to challenge legitimate free speech on the historical or theological actions of Islamic states. There is also a risk it could also undermine counter-terrorism powers, which seek to tackle extremism or prevent terrorism.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."|"UK rejects new definition of Islamophobia after fears raised it would undermine counter-terrorism, curb free speech"|"Thu May 16 23:03:00 CEST 2019"|"[world]"

The development reported by officials on Wednesday appeared to reflect a recognition that neither side had been able to prevail in the struggle for power, leaving Venezuela in a state of paralysis after years of hyperinflation and shortages of food and medicine. It was also a policy reversal for the opposition, which has accused President Nicolas Maduro of using previous negotiations to play for time. Senior members of both sides will be involved in the exploratory discussions in Oslo, said members of Venezuela's opposition-controlled congress who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the talks. Delegations from the two opposing camps had received separate invitations from a group of Norwegians, one official said. The representatives include Information Minister Jorge Rodriguez on the government side and Stalin Gonzalez, a leading member of the National Assembly, the officials said. Maduro did not directly comment on the talks during televised remarks, but he said Rodriguez was on a ``very important'' mission outside Venezuela. Per Wiggen, an official from Norway's Ministry of Foreign Affairs would not comment, even to confirm talks, though Norway has been calling on the two sides to talk since February. Minister Ine Eriksen Soereide told lawmakers on March 5 that Norway could be a mediator. ""We are in contact with both parties in Venezuela and can provide assistance if the parties wish,"" she said at the time. The planned talks seemed likely to dampen speculation that the United States, the main backer of the Venezuelan opposition, might be considering military action as a way to end the crisis in the near term. U.S. officials have previously said they are focusing on diplomatic and economic measures to force out Maduro, though opposition leader Juan Guaido said his Washington envoy will meet with the head of the U.S. Southern Command on Monday. The two sides are currently far apart on many issues. The opposition has insisted that Maduro was illegitimately elected last year and that he must step aside to make way for elections. Maduro, in turn, accuses the opposition of being U.S. stooges intent on illegally seizing power. The Norway dialogue comes as a mostly European group of nations prepares to send a high-level delegation to Venezuela to propose solutions to the country's protracted crisis. The International Contact Group consists of eight European countries, the European Union and four Latin American countries. The group formed after Guaido, the head of the National Assembly, declared himself Venezuela's interim president early this year in a direct challenge to the rule of Maduro, who says his government champions the socialist principles of his predecessor, Hugo Chavez. The opposition, which is backed by the United States and about 50 other nations, says Venezuela's dire economic state is the result of years of corruption and mismanagement. Maduro blames the country's problems on U.S. sanctions that were imposed more recently. Also Wednesday, the United States suspended all commercial passenger and cargo flights between the U.S. and Venezuela, saying the political unrest and tensions there pose a risk to flights. The announcement by the Department of Homeland Security affected a dwindling number of flights between the two countries, since U.S. airlines no longer fly to Venezuela. The measure reflected the increasingly sour relationship between the Venezuelan government and the U.S. Conditions in Venezuela ``threaten the safety and security of passengers, aircraft, and crew,'' the department said. It said the flight suspension will continue indefinitely, though the decision will be reviewed if the situation in Venezuela changes. Maduro criticized the suspension of flights, saying the measure was an attack on freedom of movement. American Airlines stopped its flights in mid-March after union leaders told pilots not to go there due to safety concerns. Some other international airlines quit flying to Venezuela years ago because of the country's deteriorating economy. Some Venezuelan airlines had been operating commercial flights to and from Miami, though those were already affected by the upheaval in the South American country, including after a failed call for a military uprising by the opposition on April 30.

Bomb blasts can happen ""anywhere, anytime,'' he said, adding that he was not afraid. ""Sri Lanka is an amazing country. This is my first visit and I will tell my friends also to come.'' His is a lone voice and a lone presence. Sri Lanka was the Lonely Planet guide's top travel destination for 2019, but since the Easter Sunday attacks on churches and luxury hotels, foreign tourists have fled. Many of those booked to come in the next few months have canceled. Hotel occupancy across the island has plummeted by 85% to 90%. The tropical beaches, restaurants and shops are empty. The coordinated suicide bombings on April 21 not only destroyed lives but also wiped out the livelihoods of Sri Lankans who depend on tourism. More than 250 people, including 45 foreigners mainly from China, India, the US and the UK, died in the Islamic State group-claimed blasts. Tourists normally come to Hikkaduwa, in the southwest, for the strong waves that are perfect for surfing and sparkling clear waters made for snorkeling. Today, of the 27 hotels, very few are open. Most, along with the eateries that line the 6-kilometer (3.7-mile) stretch of palm-fringed beach, are closed. Among the few hotels still open is Hikkaduwa Beach Hotel. On April 21, all 50 rooms were occupied; today, only a handful. ``It's a real disaster. We don't know what to do right now,'' said Sanjeewani Yogarajah, an executive with the hotel. She said the attack has cost the hotel 5.5 million Sri Lankan rupees ($31,000), forcing the hotel's management to send half the staff home. Some tourism officials say the damage to the industry after the bombings is worse than during the 26-year civil war between the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and the government which ended a decade ago. At least then, the violence was mostly contained to the north of Sri Lanka, they said. This time, no part of the island has remained untouched by the blasts. Lankesha Ponnamperuma, general manager of hotel chain Hikka Tranz, is one of the luckier ones. While most hotels report wholesale cancellations, he is surviving thanks to business from local residents. Last Friday, two-thirds of the 150 rooms were booked, mostly by domestic tourists. ""I haven't sacked anyone yet. Instead, we are training our people to adjust their expenditure and helping them restructure their bank loans,'' Ponnamperuma said. The president of Sri Lanka's Hotels Association, Sanath Ukwatta, said hotels have offered 30-50% discounts to entice local residents. Such a strategy won't solve the problem, he said, but will ``help at least to keep the hotels going.'' The manager of a clothing shop said the owner had shut the group's other two shops and the factory too. ""Business collapsed after April 21,'' said Kumari, who declined to give her surname. According to government figures, there has been an 80% drop in arrivals since the attack. Tourism accounts for 4.9% of Sri Lanka's GDP. Last year, 2.3 million tourists visited the island, generating $4.4 billion in revenues, a nearly 12% jump from 2017. Around half a million Sri Lankans directly depend on tourism while 2 million depend on it indirectly. One of them is Mohomed Musflick, the owner of a souvenir shop in Galle which is full of wood carvings, local paintings and postcards. ``I have not sold one item. There are no tourists and we are in a huge crisis,'' he said. While life is gradually returning to normal on the island with offices and schools re-opening, the tourism industry is in a somber mood over the slump in foreign tourists. Tour operators from Russia, Norway and Britain have canceled bookings going right up to April 2020. A travel ban issued by nearly a dozen countries is the greatest cause for concern. ""The ban is our main worry. Until it is removed or softened, we can't start our marketing to attract tourists. If it is lifted soon, we are hopeful we can bounce back this year or otherwise definitely next year for sure,'' said Yogarajah. In the meantime, Sri Lanka's government should target ``people and countries resilient to this kind of attacks and situations, such as Russia, Israel and India,'' said Anusha Frydman, managing director of the Lavanga Resort and Spa. The industry is clear about what else it wants from the authorities: Ensure that stringent security measures are in place to reassure potential visitors; persuade politicians to put their differences aside and adopt a bipartisan approach on national security; and work fast to get the travel ban lifted. To help the industry cope, the government has put together a relief package comprising easy loans at special rates and reduced taxes. The government also plans to formulate a $100 million insurance fund for compensation to any tourist injured or killed while visiting the island. ""In the past we have had many serious crises and we have recovered. I am quite positive we can do it again,'' said Jan van Twest, general manager of the Fortress Resort and Spa near Galle, where 750 room nights have been canceled from May to October. ""But we need to recover, recover very fast,'' he said.

School districts are using products like gunshot detection systems that identify where shots are fired and apps that allow teachers to report attacks and connect with police. While a focus on gun control often emerges after shootings, technology can be a less partisan solution that's quick to implement — though some experts say funding preventive mental health resources should be the priority. The tech approach comes amid rising concern over the inability to prevent shootings like the one last week at a suburban Denver high school. Student Kendrick Castillo, 18, was killed after charging one of the gunmen and was honored at a memorial service Wednesday. ""If I'm intent on shooting people at a school, there are 20 ways to do it,"" said Erik Endress, CEO of Share911, a New Jersey-based company with an app that allows staff to immediately report to colleagues and police everything from medical conditions to active shooters. ""We can improve the outcome of these situations,"" Endress said. ""We can minimize the casualty count."" While school attacks are relatively rare, they have been among the deadliest mass shootings in US history. The 1999 massacre of 13 people at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, ushered in a new era of school security but the carnage continued, including 27 people killed in 2012 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, and 17 deaths last year at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Joseph Erardi, a retired Newtown superintendent who came to the district a year after the shooting, said lawmakers pressed for ""hardening"" infrastructure at schools. That has spurred a billion-dollar industry where companies manufacture products from ""ballistic attack-resistant"" doors to smoke cannons. The hardening market, as well as lobbying efforts to get taxpayer dollars to fund upgrades, had stalled in recent years but rekindled after the Parkland shooting. ""We've kind of reached this state of frustration where we (feel like we) can't protect our students,"" said Dennis Kenney, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. ""What we're trying to do is find some technological fix, and there isn't one."" Districts nationwide are recognizing that and instituting an approach that combines technology with mental health programs, bullying prevention and security officers. Beverly Hills Unified School District is one. ""That's like the Number 1 concept of security for any principal: physical security and emotional security of children,"" said Juliet Fine, principal at Horace Mann School, which serves kindergarten through eighth grade. Beverly Hills is among 200 US school districts using the Share911 app. The board of education added it and other measures, including armed security officers, following the Parkland shooting. In the fall, the district will add a central command center that will monitor feeds from all the district's surveillance cameras and use software to monitor keywords in online search traffic for potential threats. ""Safety in schools is evolving. Technology and software, like in all aspects of the modern world, need to be utilized and used,"" said Christopher Hertz, district director of school safety. ""We want our kids to feel and be safe. ... If we do all this, then our teachers can do what they need to do."" Wealthier areas have not been immune to violence. Horace Mann parents and teachers stressed that they and students feel safe within the walled campus, and not just because it's in an exclusive area. ""I'm grateful I live in this community that has so much security, and I know they are protected,"" Evelyn Lahiji, 42, said as she picked up her sons, Lorenzo Naghdechi, 8, and Leonardo Naghdechi, 9. Christina Richner, 45, said her 6-year-old son, Julian, and 9-year-old daughter, Olivia, have gone through so many emergency drills that ""their reflexes will kick in"" during a shooting. The students are trained to gather in a corner with the classroom's lights out and blinds drawn in a lockdown, social studies teacher Laura Stark said. Staffers check in via the Share911 app to share information, including if any kids are missing or injured. Share911 launched three weeks after the Sandy Hook shooting. The app provides real-time data to school employees and law enforcement, such as the type of threat and its location, based on floor plans of the building. ""You can't decide if you're going to run, hide or fight in the absence of information,"" said Endress, the CEO. AmberBox, an indoor gunshot detection product that looks like a smoke detector, has a similar philosophy. It alerts school officials and law enforcement the moment a shot is fired and maps the location. The system uses sensors that track a gun's muzzle flash and a bullet's shockwave, CEO James Popper said. Chicago-based Aegis AI is refining technology to identify a gun as soon as it enters an area that a camera is scanning. The company was incorporated a year ago and still is working to minimize false alarms, such as when the software flags a staple gun or drill, CEO Sonny Tai said. Most of its clients are in a pilot program. Some experts are concerned that districts are embracing technology to allay public concern while taking money away from mental health programs and violence-prevention efforts. ""It's something you can show. I can go to a board meeting and hold up this shiny thing,"" said Amy Klinger, co-founder of The Educator's School Safety Network and a former teacher and school administrator in Ohio. Despite the advances in both safety technology and mental health programs, experts say there's no foolproof way to predict or stop a shooting. Wealthy, suburban districts like Beverly Hills that can afford the latest innovations face as much risk as inner-city schools where metal detectors have been commonplace for years. ""Nobody ever thinks it's going to happen there,"" Endress said. ""Well, it's happening everywhere.""

Kami Rita Sherpa, who summited Everest 22nd time last year to set record of most summits on Mount Everest, stood on top of the 8,850-metres peak together with other sherpas on Wednesday morning, the ‘Himalayan Times’ reported. “Kami Rita Sherpa from Thame village of Solukhumbu district successfully climbed Mount Everest at around 7.50am from Nepal side breaking his own record for most summits on the roof of the world,” Mingma Sherpa, chairman at Seven Summit Treks, was quoted as saying by the paper. Rita has been climbing Mount Everest since 1994. He couldn’t climb the Everest in 1995 after his client got sick on the way to the summit, ‘My Republica’ reported. In 1995, he abandoned the summit bid after the deadliest avalanche killed expedition teams. In 2017, Kami became the third person to climb Mount Everest for the 21st time, equalising the achievement of Apa Sherpa and Phurba Tashi Sherpa, both of whom have since retired.

The definition, proposed by the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on British Muslims based on wide consultation over the issue, reads: ""Islamophobia is rooted in racism and is a type of racism that targets expressions of Muslimness or perceived Muslimness."" But the UK's National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) warned in a statement on Wednesday that the definition may be too broad and cause confusion. ""We take all reports of hate crime very seriously and will investigate them thoroughly. However, we have some concerns about the proposed definition of Islamophobia made by the All Party Parliamentary Group on British Muslims,"" said NPCC Chair Martin Hewitt. ""We are concerned that the definition is too broad as currently drafted, could cause confusion for officers enforcing it and could be used to challenge legitimate free speech on the historical or theological actions of Islamic states. There is also a risk it could also undermine counter-terrorism powers, which seek to tackle extremism or prevent terrorism,"" he said, calling for wider consultation on any definition of anti-Muslim hostility. The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), which had made a ""resounding call"" for political leaders to adopt the definition when it was released as part of the APPG on British Muslims report at the end of last year, attacked the NPCC stand. MCB general secretary Harun Khan said: ""Our understanding is that the police and security forces will rightly fight terrorism based on intelligence and a scrutiny of the evidence. ""Anti-terrorist operations can only be 'hampered' if counter-terror officers have been targeting Muslims because of their identity (or Muslimness as the definition states), categorising them as security concerns. If this is the case, it confirms long-voiced concerns about the disproportionate focus and impact of counter-terror operations on Muslim communities."" The row comes ahead of a UK Parliament debate on whether to formally adopt a definition of Islamophobia. The debate, initiated by MPs from the APPG on British Muslims in the House of Commons on Thursday, is expected to mount pressure on the Theresa May led government to accept the formal definition. The definition, which has been accepted by Opposition parties such as Labour and the Liberal Democrats as well as the London Mayor's Office, followed concerns of a rising number of Islamophobic attacks in the UK. Home office data notes that 52 per cent of religious hate crimes recorded by the police was against Muslims. The APPG's report concluded that the lack of an official definition was hampering efforts to counter Islamophobia, harming Muslims and wider British society. It said: ""The aim of establishing a working definition of Islamophobia has neither been motivated by, nor is intended to curtail, free speech or criticism of Islam as a religion. ""No open society can place religion above criticism and we do not subscribe to the view that a working definition of Islamophobia can or should be formulated with the purpose of protecting Islam from free and fair criticism or debate."" Baroness Sayeeda Warsi, a former Conservative Party chair who has called for an inquiry into Islamophobia within the Tory party in the past, also countered the view that a formal definition would interfere with police work. ""The report makes clear that the definition does not seek to protect or stop criticism of Islam - to suggest it would, is disingenuous and divisive,"" she said. ""The inability of senior police officers to understand how Islamophobia - the plethora of everyday microaggressions impacting British Muslims is not the same as hate crime shows a worrying lack of understanding of the communities they seek to police,"" she said. A minister is set to present the UK government stand on the definition of Islamophobia at the end of the Commons debate this week, but it looks unlikely that it would be formally adopted. A UK government spokesperson said it was conscious that the APPG's proposed definition has ""not been broadly accepted"" and the matter needs further careful consideration. ""Any hatred directed against British Muslims and others because of their faith or heritage is utterly unacceptable,"" the spokesperson said.

Makki, head of JuD's political and international affairs wing and in-charge of its charity Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation (FIF), was arrested during a government crackdown against the outlawed organisations. Punjab police spokesperson Nabila Ghazanfar confirmed Makki's arrest. She, however, did not explain the charges under which he was arrested. Sources said Makki has been arrested for making a hate speech in Gujranwala city, some 80-km from Lahore. The sources also said his arrest should be seen in connection with the government's steps to comply with the requirement of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The US Department of the Treasury has designated Saeed as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist, and the US, since 2012, has offered a USD 10 million reward for information that brings him to justice. Saeed is keeping a low profile and currently living at his Lahore residence under high security. For the first time in two decades, Saeed was not allowed to enter and deliver weekly sermon at JuD headquarters in Lahore since early this March. The JuD and its sister organization Falah-i-Insaniat (FIF) leadership has already gone underground in the wake of the government's action against the proscribed organizations. In February, Paris-based international terror financing watchdog FATF decided to continue the 'Grey' listing of Pakistan for its failure to stop funding of terrorist groups such as the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and the JuD. The Pakistan government has launched a crackdown against the outlawed organisations under the National Action Plan 2015 to eliminate militancy and extremism from the country's soil. The Pakistan government had arrested over 100 members of banned outfits including the Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar's son and brother and taken control of JeM, JuD and FIF properties including seminaries and mosques across the country apparently under immense international pressure. The government termed the action in accordance with the National Action Plan and meeting the obligations of the Financial Action Task Force. The Imran Khan-led government has also announced the freezing of accounts and seizure of assets linked to organisations banned by the UN Security Council. The government banned 11 organisations for having links with the proscribed outifts JuD, FIF and JeM on Saturday. After the February 14 Pulwama terror attack, in which 40 Indian security personnel were killed by a suicide bomber of the Pakistan-based JeM, prime minister Khan had said Islamabad would not spare any group involved in militancy or using Pakistani soil for any kind of terror activity against other countries. The FIF, like the JuD, was also banned in March by the Pakistan government. Recently, the government announced to take control of more than 30,000 religious seminaries. The JuD is believed to be the front organisation for the LeT which is responsible for carrying out the Mumbai attack that killed 166 people. It had been declared as a foreign terrorist organisation by the US in June 2014.

The government imposed the island-wide curfew on Monday after the violence against the Muslim community, who account for 10 per cent of the country's population. The curfew was briefly lifted on Tuesday before being reimposed for a second straight night following reports of fresh violence in some parts of the country. ""The curfew imposed in the North-western Province and Gampaha Police division was removed at 6 am Wednesday while the curfew in the other areas of the island ended at 4 am,"" police media spokesman's office stated. The situation in the province is returning to normalcy, authorities said. There were no incidents of violence overnight and groups of people responsible for taking part in mob attacks have been arrested, they said. ""Thirty-three suspects arrested in connection with the anti-Muslim riots have been remanded and over 60 people have been arrested. The suspects can be sentenced to 10 years in prison under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), police spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara said. The police media spokesman said the illegal activities committed by the persons engaged in violence will be noted in their police certificates. The academic activities of all schools and all the state institutions in the province were resumed on Wednesday, the Wayamba Province Governor Peshala Jayaratne said. The recent violence is a fresh backlash from the Easter attacks where nine suicide bombers, including a woman, carried out a series of devastating blasts that tore through three churches and three luxury hotels, killing 258 people and injuring over 500 others. Muslims said that rioters went about destroying their properties and setting fire to them even after curfew hours. They accused the security forces and the police for becoming silent watchers to the rioting. Muslim political parties said at least one person was killed in the riots. The attacks come during the Muslim holy fasting month of Ramazan. The government also reimposed a ban on social media following the violent clashes. The government which blocked Facebook and WhatsApp on Tuesday extended the blockade to Twitter. The social media blockade is meant to prevent the spread of rumours and hate comments, the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority said. Sri Lanka has a population of 21 million which is a patchwork of ethnicities and religions, dominated by the Sinhalese Buddhist majority. Muslims account for 10 per cent of the population and are the second-largest minority after Hindus. Around seven per cent of Sri Lankans are Christians.

In a series of tweets that laid out clearly that he would settle for nothing less than a Chinese capitulation in the trade war, even if it means Americans having to put up with pain for now, Trump has said Beijing has the option of either acceding to US demands – mainly protecting US intellectual property rights and not stealing American know-how, and closing the trade gap by buying more US products and produce – or seeing its economy go down the tubes. The United States, he maintains, will have no problems and will prosper either way. Although many economists and even some Republican lawmakers are warning that such a hardball approach will also end up hurting the US – particularly its farmers and farm corporations – Trump is arguing that both in the short term and in the long run, it will bring back to America manufacturing and jobs that it lost to China over the past two decades – a bleeding that he and his cohorts attribute to the fecklessness of his predecessors and to greedy US corporations which gave China a leg up in search of quick profits. “China buys MUCH less from us than we buy from them, by almost 500 Billion Dollars, so we are in a fantastic position. Make your product at home in the USA and there is no Tariff,” Trump wrote in a series of tweets this week, adding, “My respect and friendship with President Xi is unlimited but, as I have told him many times before, this must be a great deal for the United States or it just doesn’t make any sense.""

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 1557832618000 Trump’s uninhibited twitterstorm also held out both opportunity and warning to other countries, notably India, which is wrapped up in its own expansive elections and seems oblivious to the most consequential confrontation in the world since the end of the Cold War. “Other countries are already negotiating with us because they don’t want this to happen to them. They must be a part of USA action,” Trump wrote of his bearing down on China. He also advised US companies and consumers complaining about them having to bear the costs of Trump’s tariff on imports from China to “buy from a non-Tariffed country instead of China.” Trump associates and advisors are resolute in their belief that he will not back down in this face-off with China, which they describe as a life-and-death issue for the United States. “China has been running an economic war against the industrial democracies for 20 years,” Trump’s former chief strategist Steve Bannon said in a CNBC interview, maintaining that the face-off with Beijing “cuts to the core of what the United States is going to be in the future,” and Trump will settle for nothing short of victory. “Let me tell you something…we always win,” Trump himself bragged in a brief White House interaction with reporters as he headed out to boost the rise of US – on a net oil importer - as an energy superpower. Remarkably, Trump has the backing of some powerful Democrat lawmakers (most prominently New York’s Chuck Schumer) and influential liberal columnists (notably NYT’s Tom Friedman) as he seeks to wrest the initiative from China, which in the Trump narrative, has stolen a march over US by literally stealing its technology. The Trump administration is now cracking down on such “theft” with measures ranging from monitoring and constraining Chinese scholars and students visiting and studying in US, to red-flagging Chinese tech giants such as Huawei and ZTE, both of whom are expected to face a crackdown in the US in the coming days. In fact, it is some Republican lawmakers who are free trade proponents who are panicking at what Trump could be inflicting on American farmers, who are both their and Trump’s prime constituency, and whose well-being depends on how much meat and produce China buys. The prospect of China slapping tariffs and downsizing purchase of beef, soy, corn etc U.S agri sector, but Trump is quite sanguine, maintaining “Our great Patriot Farmers will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of what is happening now,” while promising a $ 15 billion subsidy to tide over their crisis. “Hopefully China will do us the honor of continuing to buy our great farm product, the best, but if not your Country will be making up the difference based on a very high China buy...This money will come from the massive Tariffs being paid to the United States for allowing China, and others, to do business with us. The Farmers have been “forgotten” for many years. Their time is now!” Trump wrote.

Punjab is Pakistan's second largest province by area after Balochistan. It is also the most populated province and politically influential. In the run-up to the 2018 general election, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party led by Imran Khan had promised to bifurcate Punjab province to form South Punjab. The South Punjab province will comprise Multan, Bahawalpur and Dera Ghazi Khan districts, Qureshi told reporters in Multan, Punjab. The Punjab Assembly seats will be reduced to 251 from the current 371 while 120 seats have been proposed for the South Punjab Assembly in the bill. Qureshi said that certain constitutional amendments have to be passed for the formation of the new South Punjab province. The region will turn into a province when amendments to Articles 59, 51, 1, 106, 158 and 218 of the Constitution are passed. ""The word 'South Punjab' in the first paragraph of Article 1 will be inducted, and the territories that will be part of south Punjab have been named in the proposed bill,"" he was quoted as saying by the Express Tribune. ""The province will come into being through Article 51, it calls for the separate formation of the assembly. South Punjab will also get representation in the Senate,"" he said. On Monday, lawmaker Sami-ul-Hassan Gillani tabled the Constitution (Amendment) Bill 2019 before Parliament, calling for the creation of a separate South Punjab province, Geo News reported. The planned South Punjab province will be the sixth province of Pakistan after Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, Sindh and Gilgit Baltistan. Qureshi, a senior leader of the ruling , said that the National Assembly Speaker will formulate a special committee for consent on the bill. ""We require co-operation of different parties for a two-thirds majority, said Qureshi. Qureshi said that he had held a meeting with Pakistan Peoples Party's (PPP) leadership. ""I request them to support us as it is in our joint interests and a part of the manifesto."" ""We believe it strengthens a federation, and have decided to hold political dialogue with like-minded political parties,"" he said. Qureshi also requested the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) to support the bill. ""I am hopeful they will review their attitude over it,"" he said. The National Assembly, Pakistan's lower house, has a total 342 seats, which means the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf needs 228 votes to get its way. The Pakistan Tehreek- e- Insaf has 157 lawmakers. The Pakistan Muslim League-N has 84 members and the Pakistan Peoples Party has 54 lawmakers in Parliament. There are four independents. To get the South Punjab bill approved, they would only need the support of the PPP, if the PML-N opts to stay out of the vote count, Geo News reported. The PPP support will also be needed in the Senate where the party has an upper hand, the report said. Meanwhile, PML-N Secretary General Ahsan Iqbal said Qureshi was fooling people on the name of South Punjab. Iqbal said the PML-N had already presented a bill in the National Assembly for the formation of the South Punjab and Bahawalpur provinces. But the bill was opposed by the then, he said.

Makki, according to the interior (home) ministry, was arrested from Gujranwala, in central Punjab, and shifted to prison in the adjacent city of Lahore. The interior ministry said Makki was arrested during an ongoing crackdown against proscribed organisations. He was taken into custody for his hate speeches against the crackdown on banned organisations and raising funds for Falah-i-Insaniat Foundation (FIF), the charity wing of JuD. In his recent speeches, Makki was also criticising the steps being taken by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a Paris-based international body mandated to combat money laundering and terror financing. His arrest, the interior ministry said, was made under the Maintenance of Public Order Act, a public safety law. Makki, 71, belongs to a Gujjar family; he was the JuD second-in-command, in charge of FIF, and also headed JuD’s political and international affairs wing. The US treasury department, at the behest of India, had designated him a specially designated national and had announced a reward of $2 million through its “Rewards for Justice Programme” for information leading to him. In February this year, Pakistan had launched a crackdown on outlawed organisations under the National Action Plan (NAP), a policy formulated in January 2015 to eradicate terrorism and extremism from the country. Since the designation of JuD and FIF as proscribed groups, the government had frozen all its accounts and sealed its seminaries besides taking administrative control of its pharmacies, health units, schools, ambulances and steamer boats across Pakistan. Under the NAP, more than 500 properties owned by JuD and FIF have been confiscated in 36 district of only Punjab, Pakistan’s most populated province. The management and operational control of these properties have been taken over by the district administration. The JuD and FIF were placed on the watch list by the UN in January 2017. They were declared proscribed by the UN in March 2019 and subsequently by the interior ministry under the Anti-Terrorism Act. Since the organisations and its splinter groups have been notified as proscribed, giving them aid or financial assistance has become illegal and anyone supporting them in any manner can be punished with up to 10 years’ imprisonment and a heavy fine.

In a series of tweets that laid out clearly that he would settle for nothing less than a Chinese capitulation in the trade war, even if it means Americans having to put up with pain for now, Trump has said Beijing has the option of either acceding to US demands – mainly protecting US intellectual property rights and not stealing American know-how, and closing the trade gap by buying more US products and produce – or seeing its economy go down the tubes. The United States, he maintains, will have no problems and will prosper either way. Although many economists and even some Republican lawmakers are warning that such a hardball approach will also end up hurting the US – particularly its farmers and farm corporations – Trump is arguing that both in the short term and in the long run, it will bring back to America manufacturing and jobs that it lost to China over the past two decades – a bleeding that he and his cohorts attribute to the fecklessness of his predecessors and to greedy US corporations which gave China a leg up in search of quick profits. “China buys MUCH less from us than we buy from them, by almost 500 Billion Dollars, so we are in a fantastic position. Make your product at home in the USA and there is no Tariff,” Trump wrote in a series of tweets this week, adding, “My respect and friendship with President Xi is unlimited but, as I have told him many times before, this must be a great deal for the United States or it just doesn’t make any sense.""

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 1557832618000 Trump’s uninhibited twitterstorm also held out both opportunity and warning to other countries, notably India, which is wrapped up in its own expansive elections and seems oblivious to the most consequential confrontation in the world since the end of the Cold War. “Other countries are already negotiating with us because they don’t want this to happen to them. They must be a part of USA action,” Trump wrote of his bearing down on China. He also advised US companies and consumers complaining about them having to bear the costs of Trump’s tariff on imports from China to “buy from a non-Tariffed country instead of China.” Trump associates and advisors are resolute in their belief that he will not back down in this face-off with China, which they describe as a life-and-death issue for the United States. “China has been running an economic war against the industrial democracies for 20 years,” Trump’s former chief strategist Steve Bannon said in a CNBC interview, maintaining that the face-off with Beijing “cuts to the core of what the United States is going to be in the future,” and Trump will settle for nothing short of victory. “Let me tell you something…we always win,” Trump himself bragged in a brief White House interaction with reporters as he headed out to boost the rise of US – on a net oil importer - as an energy superpower. Remarkably, Trump has the backing of some powerful Democrat lawmakers (most prominently New York’s Chuck Schumer) and influential liberal columnists (notably NYT’s Tom Friedman) as he seeks to wrest the initiative from China, which in the Trump narrative, has stolen a march over US by literally stealing its technology. The Trump administration is now cracking down on such “theft” with measures ranging from monitoring and constraining Chinese scholars and students visiting and studying in US, to red-flagging Chinese tech giants such as Huawei and ZTE, both of whom are expected to face a crackdown in the US in the coming days. In fact, it is some Republican lawmakers who are free trade proponents who are panicking at what Trump could be inflicting on American farmers, who are both their and Trump’s prime constituency, and whose well-being depends on how much meat and produce China buys. The prospect of China slapping tariffs and downsizing purchase of beef, soy, corn etc U.S agri sector, but Trump is quite sanguine, maintaining “Our great Patriot Farmers will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of what is happening now,” while promising a $ 15 billion subsidy to tide over their crisis. “Hopefully China will do us the honor of continuing to buy our great farm product, the best, but if not your Country will be making up the difference based on a very high China buy...This money will come from the massive Tariffs being paid to the United States for allowing China, and others, to do business with us. The Farmers have been “forgotten” for many years. Their time is now!” Trump wrote.

The spokesperson said on Tuesday night that a vote on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill that would pave the way for Brexit was ""imperative"" if the UK was to leave the European Union (EU) before the MPs' summer recess, reports the BBC. However, this would not amount to a fourth so-called meaningful vote on the Prime Minister's Withdrawal Agreement itself. UK needs to pass a law to implement the withdrawal agreement - the part of May's Brexit deal which will take the country out of the EU - in UK law. This is a requirement under the terms of previous Brexit legislation passed last year. The legislation would make the citizens' rights part of the agreement directly enforceable in UK courts, and set their relationship with the EU's Court of Justice. Attempts to find a cross-party compromise began after May's Brexit deal was rejected three times by MPs. The development comes after May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn met on Tuesday evening to discuss the ongoing talks, which the Downing Street gas described as ""both useful and constructive"", the BBC said. May had made clear the government's ""determination to bring the talks to a conclusion and deliver on the referendum result to leave the EU"", it added. Meawnhile, a Labour spokesman said Corbyn had ""raised doubts over the credibility of government commitments, following statements by Conservative MPs and cabinet ministers seeking to replace the Prime Minister"". He also said that Corbyn had called for ""further movement"" from the government and that the Prime Minister's team had agreed to bring back ""further proposals tomorrow (Wednesday)"". The UK had been due to leave the European Union on March 29, but the deadline was pushed to October 31 after Parliament was unable to agree a way forward.

The development implies that Iran will no longer have any limits for the production of enriched uranium, ISNA news agency reported. ""Stopping programs related to compliance with the ceiling for production of enriched uranium as well as the unlimited production of heavy water at the Arak facility are programs seriously pursued as stressed during the first 60-day period related to Iran's first step in response to the US withdrawal from the nuclear deal,"" an official from the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran (AEOI) said. The country had recently announced partial withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear decision, a year after the United States unilaterally pulled out of the agreement. The announcement meant that Iran would stop exporting enriched uranium stocks as against what was stipulated by the 2015 agreement. It also warned that the remaining signatories -- the UK, France, Germany, China, and Russia -- had 60 days before it would resume high-level enrichment of uranium. The European Union had rejected Iran's two-month ultimatum and urged the country to continue implementing its commitments under the said agreement. The 2015 Iran nuclear deal, officially titled Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA), was hailed as a major diplomatic victory by the Obama administration. It was intended to limit Iran's civilian energy programme - thereby preventing it from developing nuclear weapons at some point in the future - in exchange for relief from sanctions that were crippling the country's economy. However, the Donald Trump-led US government withdrew from the deal, saying it was ""defective at its core."" Since then, the US has restored economic sanctions on Iran. Washington's decision of pulling out from the agreement soured its ties with. In the past year, the Trump administration has slapped a multitude of sanctions on Tehran citing the latter's support to state-sponsored terrorism and conflicts. Tensions further escalated on May 11 when Pentagon approved the deployment of Patriot missile defence battery and a Navy ship to the Middle East. Pentagon said the deployment was in response to ""indications of heightened Iranian readiness to conduct offensive operations against U.S. forces and interests."" Against the backdrop of this development, Iranian leaders, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, said on Wednesday that Tehran doesn't want a war that would devastate the region. They denied Iranian involvement in attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf and on a Saudi oil station, reported CNN.

Lijian Zhao, an Islamabad-based Chinese diplomat, was quoted by local media as saying that the Chinese embassy had alerted Pakistani authorities following an unusual increase in visa applications this year. “Last year, 142 Pakistani women had applied for such visas after marrying Chinese nationals. This year, so far, 140 Pakistani brides have applied for this category of visa,” Zhao said. Zhao, however, rejected media reports about Pakistani women being trafficked and subjected to forced prostitution and organ sale in China. “These are lies being spread on the internet and media for sensational purposes. There is no evidence for it,” he said. Last week, Chinese authorities held two meetings with Brigadier Ijaz Ahmad Shah (retired), minister for interior, and expressed displeasure over publicizing the arrest of Chinese nationals over the alleged bride trafficking. The Chinese authorities reportedly made it clear to the minister that if someone had done anything wrong, individually, that should not be publicized by holding press conferences because it was giving a bad name to their country. Earlier, Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) explained during a press conference how Pakistani women were fraudulently married off to Chinese men and later trafficked in China. Sources said the FIA has been asked to slow down the crackdown and avoid arrests unless someone came to them to lodge a complaint. The Chinese embassy also issued a statement last Friday saying that Chinese authorities had jointly investigated with their Pakistani counterparts the allegations of Pakistani women married off to Chinese men being forced into prostitution or organ sale, but had found no evidence in the allegations.

"70201829"|"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tropical-storm-river-flooding-hammer-gulf-of-mexico-environment/articleshow/70201829.cms"|"[AP]"|"Tropical Storm Barry could affect the environment of the Gulf coast and Lower Mississippi Valley in numerous ways, from accelerating runoff of farmland nutrients to toppling trees and damaging wildlife habitat and fisheries, scientists say. But the extent of the damage — and whether it will be at least partially offset by benefits such as disruption of the notorious Gulf of Mexico ""dead zone"" — is hard to predict, they say. That's because the region faces a rare one-two-three punch: the storm's anticipated tidal surge and torrential downpour, combined with record-high water levels in the Mississippi River. ""We don't know how the system is going to respond to all this because it's so unusual,"" said Melissa Baustian, a coastal ecologist with the Water Institute of the Gulf in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. One of the wettest-ever springs in the nation's heartland engorged the Mississippi, sending massive volumes of water southward toward the Gulf. Levees and dams were breached and millions of acres of cropland flooded in the Midwest. Barry threatens to hurl a storm surge of up to 3 feet (1 meter) onto coastal regions. And forecasters said the storm could stall inland and dump up to 2 feet (61 centimeters) of rain. Rainfall washes manure and chemical fertilizers from Midwestern corn and soybean fields into streams, smaller rivers and eventually the Mississippi. The nutrients — especially nitrogen — overfeed aquatic plants that eventually die and decompose, leaving a large section of the Gulf with little or no oxygen each summer. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted that this year's dead zone will be roughly the size of Massachusetts. Large storms can shrink the zone by churning the water column and replenishing oxygen levels in deeper areas. That could be a positive, if short-lived, outcome of Barry's rampage, Baustian said. Yet even if this year's oxygen-depleted area winds up smaller than expected, historical data suggests that Barry — like other big storms — will flush additional nutrients into the Mississippi and other Gulf tributaries, leading to bigger dead zones in the long run, said Anna Michalak of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Stanford, California. ""If you get a few sprinkles over time, the water has time to infiltrate and there's not much runoff,"" said Michalak, who studies effects of climate change on water quality. ""But a single extreme event overwhelms the capacity of the soil and the ecosystem to absorb it, and much of it ends up flowing down the rivers and ultimately off to the coast."" Even if Barry's wind speeds aren't powerful enough to make the storm a hurricane, they could topple lots of trees, their roots weakened by the saturated ground, said Tim Carruthers, coastal ecology director with the Water Institute. Also vulnerable are Louisiana's famed coastal marshes, already hammered by development and flood control measures that prevent natural coastal shoreline replenishment. Scientists also will keep watch for stranded dolphins. About 290 have been found along the Gulf coast since February 1 — triple the usual number — and nearly all have died. It's unclear why, although one possibility is exposure to fresh water coursing into the Gulf from flooding rivers and a Louisiana spillway that diverts overflow from the Mississippi, said Teri Rowles, head of a NOAA program on stranded marine mammals. The spillway, built in 1938 to provide a safety valve during flooding, has been open for a record number of days this year, said David Muth of the National Wildlife Federation's Gulf Restoration Program. The surge of fresh water also endangers oysters, brown shrimp, speckled trout and other fish that require particular salinity levels, he said. Barry's deluge could make things worse — especially in light of more intense and frequent storms brought on by global warming. ""There are going to be short-term effects on the ecosystem,"" Muth said. ""But what's out of whack is that this amount of rainfall is linked to a longer-term trend because of climate change, and that's disturbing.""

The Nepal-China Friendship Bridge (Miteri bridge) was constructed with Chinese aid at the Rasuwagadhi border point in Rasuwa district after the old bridge was damaged in the earthquake. The new bridge was constructed just five metres north-east from the damaged bridge. The newly-constructed 110-metre bridge came into operation on Thursday with cargo trucks crossing the border point, Rasuwa Customs Office chief Punya Bikram Khadka told the Kathmandu Post. Although the bridge is now open, the Chinese side is planning to officially handover the bridge to Nepal next week. The new bridge was built by a Chinese company after dismantling the old bridge, which sustained massive damage in the middle section due to a landslide triggered by the earthquake. The successful operation of the bridge also spurred the completion of the 150-metre double lane road section on the Nepali side, the report said.

Figures published by TfL, the local government body which runs London’s transport system, show that India has the fourth-highest debt of all embassies and owes TfL £6,196,465 (about Rs 55 crore). An India high commission official said they were aware of the figure but were not paying it. “This is a kind of tax and diplomatic missions are exempted from paying any taxes,” he said. The charge was introduced in 2003 to reduce congestion and pollution in the centre of the capital and invest the profits into public transport. A similar idea has been floated but never implemented in Delhi and Mumbai to ease their traffic problems. The figures show that as of March 31, 2019, the total amount owed by embassies in London for unpaid congestion charge and related penalty charge notices is £118.5 million (Rs 1,047 crore). The American embassy has the highest debt at £12.5 million (Rs 110 crore), followed by the embassy of Japan at £8.6 million (Rs 76 crore) and the Nigeria high commission, which owes £7.1 million (Rs 63 crore). A US embassy spokesperson said: “Our position on the tax established by TfL, more commonly known as the congestion charge, is based on the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which expressly prohibits the taxation of diplomatic missions in this manner. Our position is therefore wholly in accordance with that convention, to which both the US and the UK are parties, and it is a position shared by many other diplomatic missions in London.” “We are clear that the congestion charge is a charge for a service and not a tax,” said Paul Cowperthwaite, TfL’s general manager for road user charging. “This means that foreign diplomats are not exempt from paying it. We continue to pursue all unpaid congestion charge fees and penalty charge notices.” TfL is now lobbying the British government to take the debt to the UN’s International Court of Justice (ICJ.) “We’re pushing for this to be taken up by the ICJ,"" a spokesman said. Drivers have 48 hours to pay the £11.50 (Rs 1,016) fee once they have entered the zone otherwise they are slapped with a £160 (Rs 14,140) penalty charge. If they do not pay, the debt is passed onto enforcement agents who send bailiffs round. Cameras with number plate recognition record vehicles entering the zone. “With embassies, our hands are tied. If they do not pay, their license plate will incur a charge against it, but all we can do is keep sending them letters as the embassies are on diplomatic land. We can’t send bailiffs round. That’s why they have not paid as that is not particularly scary. Around three quarters of embassies in London do pay, but there remain a stubborn minority who refuse to,” the spokesman said. A UK foreign office spokesperson said they “pressed all diplomatic missions to pay congestion charge debt” and raised the issue with new ambassadors and high commissioners whose missions are in debt to TfL. But one London-based diplomat said: “Diplomacy is generally reciprocity.

Writing in the Financial Times (FT) on Friday, Theresa May’s last day as Conservative leader, Javid, among the Tory leadership hopefuls, said: “The former universities minister Jo Johnson has won support across the House of Commons for a programme of post-study visas for foreign students, allowing them to stay and work in the UK for two years after they graduate from a British university. It makes no sense to send some of the world’s brightest and most enterprising people straight home after their time here. So as prime minister I would make Mr Johnson’s plan government policy.” It was in 2012, when May was in charge of the home office (2010-2016), that the two-year post-study work visa was abolished. Indian student numbers subsequently fell from 39,090 in 2010-11 to 16,550 in 2016-17. In 2017-18, the number rose to 19,750. Currently, Indian students have to leave the UK after six months or transfer to another visa. MP Jo Johnson, an ex-FT South Asia bureau chief, has tabled a cross-party amendment to the Immigration and Social Security Coordination (EU Withdrawal) Bill, which has the backing of 78 cross-party MPs, to re-introduce the scheme and remove students from annual net migration targets. His amendment states that European Economic Area (EEA) and Swiss nationals should be allowed “to remain to search for work or gain work experience in the UK for a period of at least two years after the completion of their higher education course” and they must not be “included in any numerical limit on the number of entry visas issued”. The bill is currently at report stage in the House of Commons. Johnson, the brother of Boris Johnson MP, explained: “The scope of the bill is just about EEA and Swiss nationals as this bill is about ending EU freedom of movement in the UK so we were only able to get this amendment accepted, but that does not matter because government policy is for EEA and non-EU nationals to be treated the same post-Brexit. So once we have created the two-year post-study work visa, the government will need to level up for non-EEA nationals as it will all be one system and that is why this will affect Indian students.” “It’s been a constant goal of mine to reverse the decline in the number of Indian students coming to study in the UK ever since I was universities minister. I hope this will help make the UK a top choice for Indian students in the years to come,” Johnson said. “It can happen as soon as the bill is enacted or the home office can choose to make it policy now,” Johnson added. “The government has a choice. It either accepts this clause or it accepts defeat in the House of Commons as it will lose the vote if this clause is not added,” he said.

Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, a young reformist who assumed office a year ago, has been at the center of high-profile diplomatic efforts in the Horn of Africa region, including a surprise restoration of diplomatic ties between Ethiopia and rival Eritrea. He arrived in Sudan as the crisis following the overthrow of longtime autocrat Omar al-Bashir turned increasingly violent. The military removed al-Bashir from power in April after months of mass protests, but has resisted the protesters' demands for an immediate handover of power to civilians. On Monday, security forces violently dispersed the main sit-in outside the military headquarters in Khartoum, and similar clashes have erupted in other cities and towns. The African Union, based in Ethiopia, suspended Sudan on Thursday and threatened ""punitive sanctions'' if the military doesn't quickly relinquish power. Abiy met Friday with Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, the head of the ruling council, as well as protest leaders. In a phone interview with Saudi-owned satellite channel al-Arabiya, protest leader Gaafar Hassan declined to discuss the meeting in detail, saying a news conference would be held later, but ruled out any ""direct'' or ""indirect'' talks with the military. ""The (military) council has lost its political as well as its ethical legitimacy and we cannot deal with it, but we call for its ouster,'' he said. There was no immediate comment from the military council or the Ethiopian prime minister. The Sudan Doctors' Central Committee, one of the protest groups, said at least 113 people have been killed and more than 500 wounded since Monday. It says more than 40 bodies have been pulled from the Nile River in Khartoum and taken away by security forces since the violence erupted. The protesters have blamed much of the violence on the Rapid Support Forces, a paramilitary group that grew out of the notorious Janjaweed militias mobilized by al-Bashir during the Darfur conflict in the early 2000s. The militias were widely accused of crimes against humanity, and al-Bashir now jailed in Khartoum was indicted on charges of genocide. The head of the RSF, Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo _ better known as Hemedti _ was ""conspicuously absent'' in photos shared by the Ethiopian prime minister's office, according to Rashid Abdi, a former project director with the International Crisis Group. ""That is significant,'' he wrote on Twitter. ``Lends credence to reports of push to sideline the RSF commander.'' In a statement released late Thursday, protest leaders demanded that the RSF be dissolved and its weapons handed over to the army. Amnesty International said the RSF should return to their barracks and be barred from any law enforcement activities. ""The senseless killing of protesters must be stopped immediately, and those responsible for the bloodbath, including at command level, must be held fully accountable for their dreadful actions,'' said Kumi Naidoo, secretary general of the London-based rights group. After al-Bashir's ouster, the Ethiopian prime minister had congratulated the Sudanese people for their ``resilience in leading change'' toward a democratic Sudan. He had met with Burhan during the general's visit to Addis Ababa last week, when he committed to ``non-interference'' in the situation but urged political inclusiveness. Abiy is seen as having good relations with the West, which has cheered his reforms, as well as with powerful Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia, that have influence over Sudan's military. Awol Allo, a lecturer in law at Keele University in Britain and an Africa analyst, said Abiy stands a ``much better chance'' than anyone else in bringing the two sides together. Abiy ``brings a lot to the table, from his own experience of leading a complex transition to a massive amount of positive energy, and the weight of Ethiopia's power within the region,'' the analyst said. Meanwhile, the UN health agency said Friday it is gravely concerned over the targeting of patients, medical staff and facilities during the crackdown. Security forces are making ``incursions into Khartoum hospitals,'' the World Health Organization said, forcing shutdowns of emergency and health services. It said five patients and medical workers have been wounded. The agency said tent clinics set up to treat wounded protesters have been set ablaze and destroyed, medical equipment has been looted, and health care workers assaulted.

The dragon boats are built in the shape of war canoes and ornately carved and painted with dragon heads and tails. The largest boats are up to 12 meters (39 feet) long and carry a crew of 46 paddlers. In Hong Kong, competitors took part in the races in Aberdeen Harbor. Accompanied by the beat of the drums, the boats raced against each other to the finish line, where the winner received a victory flag. Afterward, competing teams used their paddles to splash water at each other, a way to share good fortune. In Taiwan, dozens of teams took part in races in Taipei. The Dragon Boat Festival commemorates the death of Qu Yuan, a Chinese poet and politician who is said to have drowned himself more than 2,000 years ago to protest against government corruption. Legend has it that locals wanting to prevent fish from eating Qu's remains splashed water and pounded drums to scare them away. They also threw rice dumplings in the water to feed the fish. These days, the races have become an event for companies, associations and group of friends to gather and build team spirit.

In an interview with three reporters accompanying him to the Gulf, General Frank McKenzie said he remains concerned by Iran's potential for aggression and he would not rule out requesting additional US forces to bolster defenses against Iranian missiles or other weapons. ""I don't actually believe the threat has diminished,"" McKenzie said Thursday. ""I believe the threat is very real."" McKenzie, the head of US Central Command, and other military officials are trying to strike a balance between persuading Iran that the US is prepared to retaliate for an Iranian attack on Americans, thus deterring conflict, and pushing so much military muscle into the Gulf that Iran thinks the US plans an attack, in which case it might feel compelled to strike preemptively and thus spark war. Tensions between the US and Iran have worsened since President Donald Trump withdrew from a 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and several world powers and reinstated sanctions on Tehran. Last month, in response to what American officials characterized as an imminent threat, the US announced it would rush an aircraft carrier and other assets to the region. The US also blamed Iran for last month's attacks on oil tankers in a United Arab Emirates port. On Thursday, United Nations ambassadors from the Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Norway told UN Security Council members that investigators believe those attacks were led by a foreign state using divers on speed boats who planted mines on the vessels. They did not name Iran. Earlier, the Saudi ambassador to the UN, Abdallah Al-Mouallimi, said Saudi Arabia also blames Iran for the sabotage. Iran has consistently dismissed allegations that it was involved in the recent attacks on the oil tankers or was preparing to attack American troops in the region. In Baghdad, McKenzie told reporters from The Associated Press and two other media organizations that US redeployments to the Gulf have ""caused the Iranians to back up a little bit, but I'm not sure they are strategically backing down."" The general said the US is showing enough force to ""establish deterrence"" without ""needlessly"" provoking its longtime adversary. He said he is confident in the moves he has made. ""We've taken steps to show the Iranians that we mean business in our ability to defend ourselves,"" he said, referring to the accelerated deployment to the Gulf area of the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group, four Air Force B-52 bombers and additional batteries of Army Patriot air-defense systems. Trump, speaking beside French President Emmanuel Macron in Caen, France, said US sanctions are crippling Iran's economy, possibly yielding a diplomatic opening. ""And if they want to talk, that's fine,"" Trump said. ""We'll talk. But the one thing that they can't have is they can't have nuclear weapons."" Speaking at the Baghdad headquarters of the US-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria, McKenzie said he also has repositioned surveillance aircraft to more closely monitor the situation in the Gulf and in Iraq, where the US has 5,200 troops on the ground, and has given Iran a ""new look"" by introducing more aerial patrols by land- and carrier-based fighters. ""Cumulatively, all of these have caused them to sort of step back and recalculate the course that they apparently were on,"" he said. McKenzie did not mention it, but other officials have said that in early May Iran had cruise and perhaps short-range ballistic missiles configured for potential use aboard a small number of dhows sailing off its coast. More recently, those missiles, which were deemed a potential threat, were offloaded, officials have said. McKenzie stressed that the danger of conflict with a decades-old American adversary has not passed. ""I hesitate to say that deterrence has been established,"" he said. ""We continue to see possible imminent threats"" of a potential Iranian attack. He said he could not be more specific due to the classification of the intelligence, which he said is as clear and compelling as any he has seen in years. McKenzie, a veteran of combat in Iraq and Afghanistan, took command of Central Command in late March, shortly before the onset of the latest surge of tensions with Iran. He previously directed the staff that supports the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The general said he, not the White House, initiated the May 5 moves to accelerate the deployment of the Abraham Lincoln carrier group and to dispatch B-52 bombers. He said the intelligence on Iranian threats in the first days of May was ""compelling"" and that the threats were ""advanced, imminent and very specific."" The pattern of intelligence on Iranian preparations for potential attacks emerged as the Trump administration took a pair of highly public actions meant to penalize Iran. The first was the State Department's designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization. The second, perhaps more consequential, move was a April 22 announcement that waivers for American sanctions on buyers of Iranian oil would not be renewed when they expired May 2, meaning Iran lost vital oil export revenues.

Ivan Golunov, who works for the independent website Meduza, was stopped by police in central Moscow on Thursday afternoon. Police also said that more drugs were found at his home. Meduza said in a statement on Friday that Golunov, one of the most prominent investigative journalists in Russia, was beaten while in detention and denied medical tests that would show he has not handled drugs. Moscow police denied the accusations of beating. The journalist's lawyer told the RIA Novosti news agency that his client was not allowed to contact his family or lawyer for 12 hours after he was detained. Golunov, 36, has recently received threats linked to a story he was pursing, Meduza said. ""We are convinced that Ivan Golunov is innocent,'' Meduza said in a statement. ""What's more, we have reasons to believe that Golunov is being persecuted for his journalism. We know that Vanya (Golunov) has been receiving threats in recent months, and we know which particular unfinished story they relate to.'' Meduza was founded in 2014 by a group of journalists who left a popular Russian news website after their editor was fired. The website is based in Riga, Latvia, as the journalists fear that an increasing wave of media censorship and restrictive internet laws in Russia make any editorial office there vulnerable to government pressure. While most of Meduza's staff is based in Riga, special correspondents like Golunov are working in Russia. Moscow police attached nine photos to its statement about Golunov's detention, some of which showed what appeared to be a makeshift drugs lab at his home. Alexander Urzhanov, a friend, said he had been to Golunov's place and that the pictures of the drugs lab were not taken at his apartment. Golunov rose to prominence in recent years with his corruption investigations into Moscow's city government and the crime-ridden funeral market. Peers described Golunov as one of Russia's most dogged investigative reporters. ""This is totally incredible and is not in his character that he would give up what he's been doing and start making money in this way,'' Alexander Baunov of the Moscow Carnegie Center told The Associated Press. Baunov has known Golunov since 2004 when they were worked together.

The 13-year-old survivor, a resident of Sujawal in Tando Muhammad Khan, was found in an unconscious state from a playground. Police have arrested two suspects for their involvement in the alleged sexual assault. Following identification of the arrested men by the survivor, they were remanded in police custody for four days by a local court on Saturday. According to the FIR lodged on behalf of the girl's father, his daughter had gone out to bring some groceries on Friday. On her way to the shop, two men called her towards them. When she went to them, they forced her to drink liquor and raped her. The survivor's father said when she didn't return home, he and his son started looking for her and found her in an almost unconscious state near Sugar Mills ground. He then rushed her to the Civil Hospital Tando Mohammad Khan and informed the police. Her father said she narrated her ordeal after regaining her senses at the hospital. The survivor's family are nomads. They had come to Tando Mohammad Khan recently. The girl was later referred to a government-run hospital in Hyderabad, where different tests were performed on her. Following an initial medical examination, doctors confirmed sexual assault. Zulfiqar Talpur, the top police official of Tando Mohammad Khan, told local media that DNA samples of the girl and the two suspects have been sent for further investigation. Senator Krishna Kohli, the first Hindu Dalit woman to hold this position, said the girl was forced to drink alcohol before she was gang-raped. She said the minor was in critical condition and it was possible that she was raped continuously during the period she was missing from her home.

Though China has not formally confirmed Sun’s appointment, an announcement to this effect is expected soon. The decision comes ahead of the planned meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese president Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the two-day Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in the Kyrgyz capital of Bishkek starting Thursday. Sun, who also served as the ambassador to Pakistan, is widely regarded as an expert on South Asian affairs. He is at present the director general of the policy and planning department of the foreign ministry. He was the deputy director general during Jaishankar’s tenure as ambassador in Beijing between 2009 and 2013. Sun’s appointment comes soon after PM Modi invited leaders of neighbouring countries -- including Sri Lanka, Maldives and Bangladesh -- to his swearing in ceremony and enhanced New Delhi’s outreach to countries which are being wooed with Chinese financial support. Sun will succeed Luo Zhaohui, who has been appointed as vice minister of foreign affairs. Indian ambassador to China Vikram Misri sent out a congratulatory message in a tweet that said, “Congratulations to His Excellency Sun Weidong, who has been appointed as the new Ambassador of the People's Republic of China to India - had the opportunity to welcome him home recently in Beijing and wish him all the best for his important mission.” Misri also called on Luo, who took over as the vice foreign minister of China.

Pakistan fully closed its airspace on February 26 after the Indian Air Force struck a Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) terrorist training camp in Balakot. Since then, it has only opened two routes, both of them pass through southern Pakistan, of the total 11. Pakistan's civil aviation authority is expected to review the situation on June 15. The IAF announced on May 31 that all temporary restrictions imposed on Indian airspace post the Balakot airstrike have been removed. The CAA notice issued to airmen (NOTAM) on Thursday says: ""Pakistani airspace will be closed until June 28 along its eastern border with India. The Panjgoor airspace will remain open for overflying transit flights from the western side as Air India had already been using that airspace."" A Pakistan government official told PTI that since there has been no official communication between the two countries regarding opening of their airspace for each other the ""status quo"" will prevail. ""See if some development takes place at the government's level in this respect before June 28,"" he said. On Wednesday Pakistan gave a special permission to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's VVIP flight to use its airspace for his official trip to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan. However Modi's flight avoided flying over Pakistan. Earlier, Pakistan had allowed India's (former) External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj to fly directly though Pakistani airspace to participate in the meeting of SCO foreign ministers in Bishkek on May 21. Pakistan earlier had indicated that it may lift the airspace ban along its eastern border with India imposed on February 27 to reciprocate India's decision to remove all restrictions on all air routes in the Indian airspace. As a result of the ban, foreign carriers using Indian airspace have been forced to take costly detours because they cannot fly over Pakistan. The closure mainly affects flights from Europe to Southeast Asia. The flights from Europe and the US flying in and out of New Delhi have been the worst hit. Since Pakistan's airspace closure, the airfare on many routes have gone up significantly, including Delhi-Kabul, Delhi-Moscow, Delhi-Tehran and Delhi-Astana.

The original allocation for defence for outgoing fiscal (2018-19) was Rs 1,100,334 million but it was revised later on to shot up to Rs 1,137,711 million, up by 3.4%, by the end of year. So the actual rise from previous allocation was Rs 52,201 million, which is 4.5%. But minister of state for revenue Hammad Azhar in his 2019-20 budget speech on Tuesday did not provide intricate details and just said that the defence budget would remain unchanged at Rs 1.15 trillion.

The number of deaths on Mt Everest was put at 11 by the international media, making it the deadliest season since 2015. However, the Nepal tourism ministry maintained the death toll at 9. Four Indians died on the 8,848-metres high Mt Everest and two each died on Mt Kangchenjunga and Mt Makalu, bringing the total death toll of Indian climbers in the Himalayas to 8. ""Our attention has been drawn to the wrong information about deaths on Mt Everest conveyed by national and international media,"" said Dandu Raj Ghimire, director general of the Department of Tourism (DoT), adding that ""traffic jam"" did not cause the deaths. A 'traffic jam' occurs when many climbers vie for the summit at the same time, and can be especially dangerous above 8,000 metres known as the 'death zone' The DoT's statement has come at a time when it is facing immense criticism for issuing too many permits to scale the world's tallest peak while disregarding the safety of the climbers, reports The Himalayan Times. According to Ghimire, the post-mortem reports of the deceased climbers have shown that they died due to high altitude sickness, weakness or adverse weather conditions. In the statement, the DoT has stated that it had issued 366 expedition permits in 2017 and 346 expedition permits in 2018 - not a huge difference compared to 381 permits issued this year for the highest peak. ""Hence, it untrue that congestion killed climbers on Mt Everest and we urge everyone not to be swayed by false information,"" the statement added. Ghimire also expressed his dissatisfaction at the dissemination of such ""wrong"" information in the international media. ""Such false news tarnishes our image and affects our mountaineering sector. Therefore, everyone should think twice before passing such misleading messages in international platform,"" he added. More than 200 mountaineers have died on the peak since 1922, when the first climbers' deaths on Mt Everest were recorded. The majority of bodies are believed to have remained buried under glaciers or snow. Five people died on Mt Everest in 2018. In 2016 and 2017, the world's tallest peak claimed lives of six and five climbers respectively. In 2015, quake-triggered avalanches killed 20 climbers. Hundreds of climbers flock each year to Nepal - home to several of the world's highest mountains, to scale Himalayan peaks during the spring season that begins around March and ends in June. According to Nepal Department of Tourism, more than 4,400 people have scaled the summit since Edmund Hilary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay first conquered the mountain in 1953.

The firings, which came a day after massive arrests at a protest rally in the Russian capital, reflect a careful balancing act by the Kremlin, which seeks to assuage public anger while maintaining a tight lid on dissent. Last week's arrest of Ivan Golunov on drug-dealing charges he rejected as sham drew an unprecedented show of solidarity, with three top national newspapers publishing front pages demanding his release. The interior ministry dropped all charges against the reporter on Tuesday in a highly unusual move, and asked Putin to dismiss two senior officers who oversaw the case. The Kremlin on Thursday announced the ouster of Moscow police's anti-drugs chief, Yuri Devyatkin, and head of the police department for western Moscow, Andrei Puchkov. The firings follow arrests at an unsanctioned but peaceful rally supporting Golunov in Moscow on Wednesday. Moscow police said about 200 people were detained, while independent monitoring group OVD-Info said over 500 were taken into custody and some of them were beaten. The vast majority were released quickly without charges. Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Thursday that the Kremlin is aware of complaints about excessive use of force by police and expects an official inquiry to look into that. Peskov told reporters that the president will consider proposals to revise legislation to prevent police from using drug charges to frame innocent people. ""If such initiative is formulated it will be considered,'' he said. He added that it's premature to conclude that Golunov's case highlights an urgent need for sweeping police reforms, saying that the Kremlin would await the results of an official probe. The decision to drop charges against Golunov and fire police generals responsible for his arrest marked an unusual shift for the Kremlin, which has staunchly backed law enforcement officials in other cases widely seen as trumped up. Observers say that this time the damage from Golunov's arrest was too big for the Kremlin to stick to the familiar pattern. They also say that the officials allegedly involved in fabricating the case were too insignificant to merit high-level protection. ""Moscow police's expectations for political support were rooted in their belief that the Kremlin wouldn't act against those protecting its own security, and that was a major mistake,'' analyst Tatiana Stanovaya wrote in a commentary for Moscow's Carnegie Center. Stanovaya noted that the Kremlin was angry to see a big image problem resulting from a case apparently driven by personal interests of minor officials. ""Golunov was freed not only because of public outrage, but because those who arrested him have no political value for Putin,'' she wrote. ``In the world of Putin, they are like dust.

President Xi made the remarks during his meeting with Prime Minister Modi on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in the Kyrgyz capital of Bishkek - their first interaction after Modi's re-election following the stunning victory of the BJP in the general elections last month. In a statement, the Chinese foreign ministry in Beijing said that President Xi told Prime Minister Modi that India and China should deepen cooperation by properly handling differences and called for strengthening confidence building measures to maintain stability at the border. ""China is ready to work with India to continuously advance the closer development partnership between the two countries,"" Xi said. He urged the two sides to stick to the fundamental judgement that ""China and India offer to each other chances for development, and do not pose each other threats,"" state-run Xinhua news agency reported, citing the statement. Xi called on the two countries to keep deepening mutual trust, focusing on cooperation, and properly handling their disputes so as to turn the bilateral relationship into a positive element for their respective development. He pointed out that China and India are the only two emerging markets with a population of one billion in the world, both of which are at an important stage of rapid development. Working together, China and India will not only boost each other's development, but also contribute to peace, stability and prosperity of Asia and the world at large, he said. Xi said both the countries should deepen mutual trust, focus on cooperation and properly handle differences, so as to make China-India relations a more positive asset and energy for the development of the two countries, the statement said. On the vexed boundary issue, Xi said, ""we need to make good use of the meeting of the Special Representatives on the boundary issue and other mechanisms, strengthen Confidence-Building Measures (CBMs) and maintain stability at the border areas"".

The mention of BCIM, which is part of China's multibillion dollar Belt and Road Initiative is regarded significant as it has not yet taken off unlike the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and other corridors of the initiative.

The deadline is far more ambitious than Britain’s current policy of cutting emissions by 80% over the same period and finance minister Philip Hammond has reportedly warned it could cost over 1.0 trillion pounds.

Police fired rubber bullets and beanbag rounds at the crowds, weapons that have not been widely used in recent history. Human rights groups criticized the tough tactics, while police said they were necessary against crowds of people who broke through barriers outside government headquarters and the legislature on Wednesday. The violence left 79 people injured, Hong Kong's hospital authority said. Police said 22 officers were among the injured. ""Because there were serious clashes outside the Legislative Council, we had to use some weapons including police batons, pepper spray, pepper based solution, bean bag rounds, rubber bullets, and tear gas,"" said Stephen Lo, the Hong Kong commissioner of police. Many protesters wore hard hats, masks and plastic wras protection. Eleven were arrested. Tear gas was used for the first time since the huge pro-democracy ""Umbrella Movement"" demonstrations in 2014, which marked the beginning of a shift to a tougher police approach. Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at London's School of Oriental and African Studies, said that before 2014, Hong Kong police handled large demonstrations by using softer, non-confrontational tactics. They didn't wear tactical helmets and instead gave out bottled water and medical kits. The officers ""almost invariably managed to get the local demonstrators to cooperate with them,"" he said. Police ""kept all the hardware in vans and buses"" instead of bringing it out onto the streets, he added. In September 2014, police unleashed 87 rounds of tear gas at protesters who had amassed in the same location as the current protests. They temporarily forced the protesters off the roads they had occupied, but after the smoke dissipated, bigger crowds returned, angrier than before, and didn't leave for nearly three months. Tsang said a similar result is the most likely outcome this time. Amnesty International's Hong Kong director, Man-Kei Tam, said tear gas and rubber bullets should never be used to disperse peaceful protesters because they are ""notoriously inaccurate and indiscriminate, and can result in serious injury and even death."" The group warned that the police action was ""fueling tensions and is likely to contribute to worsening violence, rather than end it."" Before 2014, police last used tear gas and pepper spray against South Korean farmers protesting against the World Trade Organization talks in Hong Kong in 2005. Prior to that, the most violent riots in the city were in 1967, when pro-communist supporters clashed with British colonial authorities as the Cultural Revolution spilled over from mainland China. The only recent incident in which Hong Kong police deployed potentially lethal force came during the 2016 Lunar New Year holiday, when protesters clashed with police in the city's gritty Mong Kok neighborhood and an officer used his gun to fire warning shots into the air.

Though China has not formally confirmed Sun’s appointment, an announcement to this effect is expected soon. The decision comes ahead of the planned meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese president Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the two-day Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in the Kyrgyz capital of Bishkek starting Thursday. Sun, who also served as the ambassador to Pakistan, is widely regarded as an expert on South Asian affairs. He is at present the director general of the policy and planning department of the foreign ministry. He was the deputy director general during Jaishankar’s tenure as ambassador in Beijing between 2009 and 2013. Sun’s appointment comes soon after PM Modi invited leaders of neighbouring countries -- including Sri Lanka, Maldives and Bangladesh -- to his swearing in ceremony and enhanced New Delhi’s outreach to countries which are being wooed with Chinese financial support. Sun will succeed Luo Zhaohui, who has been appointed as vice minister of foreign affairs. Indian ambassador to China Vikram Misri sent out a congratulatory message in a tweet that said, “Congratulations to His Excellency Sun Weidong, who has been appointed as the new Ambassador of the People's Republic of China to India - had the opportunity to welcome him home recently in Beijing and wish him all the best for his important mission.” Misri also called on Luo, who took over as the vice foreign minister of China.

""I think I'd want to hear it,'' Trump said in an interview with ABC News, adding, ``There's nothing wrong with listening.'' Trump's comments, aired Wednesday and Thursday, come as congressional investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election continue, and they drew sharp response from his would-be Democratic rivals. On Thursday, the House Intelligence Committee subpoenaed former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn and former Trump campaign aide Rick Gates as part of its ongoing probe. The role of Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., in organizing a 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer offering negative information on Hillary Clinton was a focus of special counsel Robert Mueller's probe of Russian meddling in the last presidential campaign. Mueller painstakingly documented Russian efforts to boost Trump's campaign and undermine that of his Democratic rival. But while Mueller's investigation didn't establish a criminal conspiracy between Russia and Trump's campaign, Trump repeatedly praised WikiLeaks in 2016 and celebrated information exposed by Russian hackers. One of Trump's 2020 challengers, former Vice President Joe Biden, tweeted: ""President Trump is once again welcoming foreign interference in our elections. This isn't about politics. It is a threat to our national security. An American President should not seek their aid and abet those who seek to undermine democracy.'' Several of Trump's other Democratic opponents in the 2020 race, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Kirsten Gillibrand and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, repeated their calls to begin impeachment hearings in the wake of the Republican president's latest remarks. ""An American President should not seek their aid and abet those who seek to undermine democracy,'' Biden tweeted. Just last month, Trump pledged not to use information stolen by foreign adversaries in his 2020 reelection campaign, even as he wrongly insisted he hadn't used such information to his benefit in 2016. During a question-and-answer session with reporters in the Oval Office in May, Trump said he ``would certainly agree to'' that commitment. ""I don't need it,'' he said as he met with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. ""All I need is the opponents that I'm looking at.'' Trump also insisted erroneously that he ``never did use, as you probably know,'' such information, adding: ``That's what the Mueller report was all about. They said no collusion.'' FBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers that Donald Trump Jr. should have called his agency to report the offer. But Trump, who nominated Wray to the role in 2017, told ABC News that he disagrees. ""The FBI director is wrong,'' Trump said. He added, ""Life doesn't work like that.'' Asked whether his advisers should accept information on an opponent from Russia, China or another nation or call the FBI this time, Trump said, ``I think maybe you do both,'' expressing openness to reviewing the information. ""I think you might want to listen,'' he said. ""There's nothing wrong with listening. If somebody called, from a country Norway we have information on your opponent. Oh, I think I'd want to hear it.'' Addressing the controversy Thursday on Twitter, Trump said he talks about ""everything'' with foreign governments, noting his recent overseas trip and meetings Wednesday with the president of Poland. ""Should I immediately call the FBI about these calls and meetings,'' Trump tweeted. ``How ridiculous! I would never be trusted again.''

A day after explosions blew holes in two oil tankers just outside Iran's territorial waters, rattling international oil markets, the administration seemed caught between pressure to punish Iran and reassure Washington's Gulf Arab allies without drawing the US closer to war. ""Iran did it,"" Trump said Friday on Fox News Channel's ""Fox & Friends."" He didn't offer evidence, but the US military released video it said showed Iran's Revolutionary Guard removing an unexploded mine from one of the oil tankers targeted near the Strait of Hormuz, suggesting Tehran wanted to cover its tracks. By pointing the finger at Iran, Trump was keeping a public spotlight on an adversary he accuses of terrorism but also has invited to negotiate. The approach is similar to his diplomacy with North Korea, which has quieted talk of war but not yet achieved his goal of nuclear disarmament. Iran has shown little sign of backing down, creating uncertainty about how far the Trump administration can go with its campaign of increasing pressure through sanctions. Iran denied any involvement in the attacks and accused Washington of waging an ""Iranophobic campaign"" of economic warfare. A US Navy team on Friday was aboard one of the tankers, the Japanese-owned Kokuka Courageous, collecting forensic evidence, according to a US official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive operation. Apparently alluding to the US video, Trump said Iran's culpability had been ""exposed."" He did not say what he intended to do about it but suggested ""very tough"" US sanctions, including efforts to strangle Iranian oil revenues, would have the desired effect. ""They've been told in very strong terms we want to get them back to the table,"" Trump said. Just a day earlier, the president took the opposite view, tweeting that it was ""too soon to even think about making a deal"" with Iran's leaders. ""They are not ready, and neither are we!"" Trump last year withdrew the United States from an international agreement to limit Iran's nuclear program that was signed in 2015 under his predecessor, President Barack Obama. He has since then re-instated economic sanctions aimed at compelling the Iranians to return to the negotiating table. Just last month the U.S. ended waivers that allowed some countries to continue buying Iranian oil, a move that is starving Iran of oil income and that coincided with what US officials called a surge in intelligence pointing to Iranian preparations for attacks against U.S. forces and interests in the Gulf region. In response to those intelligence warnings, the US on May 5 announced it was accelerating the deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier battle group to the Gulf region. It also sent four nuclear-capable B-52 bombers to Qatar and has beefed up its defenses in the region by deploying more Patriot air defense systems. Officials said that Pentagon deliberations about possibly sending more military resources to the region, including more Patriot missile batteries, could be accelerated by Thursday's dramatic attack on the oil tankers. At the Pentagon, acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan said Iran is not just a US problem. He said the US goal is to ""build international consensus to this international problem,"" and to ensure that US military commanders in the region get the resources and support they need. In remarks to reporters later, Shanahan noted the commercial and strategic importance of the Strait of Hormuz, through which passes about 20 percent of the world's oil. ""So, we obviously need to make contingency plans should the situation deteriorate,"" he said. Other administration officials said the US is re-evaluating its presence in the region and will discuss the matter with allies before making decisions. The officials, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity, said Thursday the US is looking at all options to ensure that maritime traffic in the region is safe and that international commerce, particularly through the Strait of Hormuz, is not disrupted. One option, they said, is for US and allied ships to accompany vessels through the strait, noting that this tactic has been used in the past. They said there is no timeline for any decisions. Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., said that providing naval escorts through the Strait of Hormuz is an option, but, ""I don't think it's a sustainable option because of the amount of traffic."" She said tanker warfare in the Persian Gulf has historically been a problem, and she wouldn't be opposed to the US having a more visible presence in the region. Slotkin, a former senior policy adviser at the Pentagon, said she is concerned that the Trump administration does not have a clear strategy on Iran. She said it's difficult to deter Iran without provoking additional violence, adding, ""I don't believe this administration is capable of walking such a deft, fine line."" In ticking off a list of Iranian acts of ""unprovoked aggression,"" including Thursday's oil tanker attacks, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo added a surprise accusation. He asserted on Thursday that a late May car bombing of a US convoy in Kabul, Afghanistan, was among a series of threats or attacks by Iran and its proxies against American and allies interests. At the time, the Taliban claimed credit for the attack, with no public word of Iranian involvement. Pompeo's inclusion of the Afghanistan attack in his list of six Iranian incidents has raised eyebrows in Congress, where he and other US officials have suggested that the administration would be legally justified in taking military action against Iran under the 2001 Authorization of Military Force, or AUMF. In that law, Congress gave then-President George W Bush authority to retaliate against al-Qaida and the Taliban for the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. It has subsequently been used to allow military force against extremists elsewhere, from the Philippines to Syria. As the world awaited Washington's next move, analysts said it was difficult to sort out the conflicting claims. ""There are few actors in the world that have less credibility than Donald Trump and the Iranian regime, so even US allies at the moment are confused about what happened,"" said Karim Sadjadpour, an Iran expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. He said the ""tremendous mistrust"" of both Trump and Iran has made ""the biggest priority for most countries to simply avoid conflict or further escalation."" At the same time, Iranian Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is in a difficult position, Sadjadpour said. ""If he didn't respond to Trump's provocations, he would risk looking like a paper tiger and projecting weakness. But if he responds overly aggressive to Trump he potentially destabilizes his own rule and his own regime. That's why we've seen Iran calibrate its escalation.""

The K P Sharma Oli-led Communist Party government had tabled the Guthi Bill in Parliament last week to amend the Guthi Act and nationalise both public and private guthis or trusts and regulate all religious sites under a powerful commission. Fearing that the government's move could jeopardise Sanatan Hindu tradition, the ethnic Newar community staged week-long protests demanding scrapping of the Bill. Following intense protests, the Nepal government Tuesday withdrew the controversial bill from the parliament, but the protestors are demanding scrapping of the Bill. Thousands of protestors -- including Guthiyars or trustees, cultural experts, social activists, civil society leaders and people from Newar communities -- participated in the rally organised at Maitighar Mandala near the Prime Minister's Office in the heart of Kathmandu. The agitators were not satisfied with the government's move to withdraw the bill temporarily for further discussion. They protestors, chanting loudly, said that the bill is a threat to the Nepal's centuries-old Sanatan Dharma and culture. They said the protest would go on until the bill is totally scrapped. The agitators also demanded the resignation Nepal's Home Minister Ram Bahadur Thapa for the alleged mistreatment of protestors by the security forces, Communication Minister Gokul Baskota for allegedly terming the Guthi trustees as ""feudals"" and Minister for Land Management and Cooperatives Padma Kumari Aryal for presenting the Bill in Parliament. ""We want the Bill brought with ill-intention to destroy our centuries old tradition and culture to be scrapped,"" Dwarika Man Tandukar, president of Newa Dyoya Dabu said. ""Our movement will continue till the Guthi Bill is totally scrapped,"" said Rajman Japali, chairman of Jyapu Mahaguthi. According to observers, Wednesday's spontaneous assembly of tens of thousands of people in the heart of the capital city was unusual as it reminded them of the historic protest rally during the Peoples' Movement of 2006 that abolished monarchy and established a republic state.

Police said the violence was triggered by the death of a Bangladeshi worker at the site of a China-funded 1,320-megawatt plant, prompting locals to accuse the Chinese of trying to cover up the incident. At one point, hundreds of Bangladeshi and Chinese workers were fighting at the site -- about 200 kilometres (125 miles) south of the capital -- and more than a dozen were injured, including six Chinese who were taken to hospital. ""One of the Chinese workers later died in the hospital. He had injuries to his head,"" local police chief Monirul Islam told AFP, adding it took over 1,000 policemen to restore calm. China is a close ally of Bangladesh, and Chinese state-run and private firms have invested billions of dollars in the South Asian country's infrastructure projects -- mostly in power, energy and transport sectors. The presence of large numbers of Chinese workers in Bangladesh, as in other countries where Beijing is investing heavily, has caused some tensions with locals, and officials said similar clashes occurred a year ago. Police said more than 6,000 people -- including some 2,000 from China -- work at the power plant site. Regional administrator Ram Chandra Das told AFP that authorities have ordered a probe into the incident. ""The situation is now calm,"" he said, adding no arrests had been made. In April 2016, four people were killed after police opened fire on villagers protesting against the construction of two China-backed power plants in southeastern Bangladesh. In October that year Chinese President Xi Jinping made a historic visit to Bangladesh and the two countries signed $20 billion worth of loan agreements. The latest clashes come just weeks before Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is to visit Beijing. China's investments in Bangladesh are part of Xi's signature Belt and Road Initiative, a sweeping trillion-dollar infrastructure programme across Asia, Africa and Europe that is viewed with suspicion in the West.

Ahead of another round of voting among Conservative MPs, former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab said Johnson was the ""only candidate"" who would take Britain out of the European Union as planned on October 31. On Tuesday, Raab was eliminated from the contest to replace Theresa May as the leader of the governing Conservative Party and therefore as prime minister, leaving five candidates standing. One of them will be eliminated in another ballot later Wednesday, before further votes on Thursday to whittle the field down to a final pair. Former foreign minister Johnson is leading the pack after securing the support of 126 of the 313 Conservative MPs in Tuesday's ballot. A figurehead of the 2016 referendum campaign for Brexit, he insists there must be no more delays to Britain's EU exit, after May postponed it twice. During a television debate on Tuesday, watched by an average 5.3 million viewers, Johnson said further delay would cause a ""catastrophic loss of confidence in politics"". But he declined to guarantee this would happen -- and one of his main rivals, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, suggested afterwards that his position was not clear. ""I am not entirely sure what he believes on this,"" Hunt told BBC radio. Hunt came second in Tuesday's ballot with 46 votes, followed by Environment Secretary Michael Gove -- another leader of the 2016 Brexit campaign -- on 41. International Development Secretary Rory Stewart, the only candidate to rule out leaving the EU with no deal, continued his unlikely progress with 37 votes. Sajid Javid, Britain's first Muslim interior minister, scraped through with 33 votes -- the minimum to avoid elimination -- while Raab fell short with 30. Raab was viewed as the candidate with the most hardline policy on Brexit, even suggesting he could suspend the session of parliament if it tried to block ""no deal"". Stewart said Wednesday that he was in talks with Gove about joining forces. Tuesday's BBC debate was the first of the campaign to feature Johnson, who dodged a previous one on Sunday and has kept his public and media appearances to a minimum. But none of the candidates made any major headway or gaffes, and Johnson remains the runaway favourite. Opposition leaders on Wednesday targeted the front-runner's past comments, with the Scottish National Party's leader in parliament Ian Blackford telling MPs: ""not only is the member racist, he is stoking division in communities."" Johnson's most uncomfortable moment in Tuesday's debate came when, following up a question from a British imam, he was challenged over his description of Muslim women wearing burkas as looking like ""letter boxes"", in a 2018 article against banning the full face veil. But the BBC was later forced to explain its vetting process after the imam was found to have posted allegedly anti-Semitic messages on his Twitter page. After Conservative MPs whittle them down to two candidates by the end of Thursday, the final pair will be put to a ballot of 160,000 party members, with the winner taking over in Downing Street likely in late July. May stepped down last month over her failure to deliver Brexit on time, although she remains prime minister until her successor is chosen. She struck an exit deal with Brussels last November, but failed three times to get it through parliament's lower House of Commons. All the candidates except Stewart insist they can renegotiate the text with the EU -- despite repeated warnings from Brussels that it will not do this. Stewart wants to try again to get the deal agreed with Brussels through parliament, but the others warn that without a change, Britain must be ready to leave with no deal at all. Johnson said in Tuesday's debate: ""None of us wants a no-deal outcome. ""We are going to make sure we come out on terms that protect the UK and protect the EU as well."" Both Hunt and Gove repeated that a further delay might be required if a Brexit deal was within reach. But Javid said it was ""fundamental"" to get out by the new deadline no matter what.

""We ignore this problem at our peril,"" warned David Santillo, senior scientist with the Greenpeace Research Laboratories at the University of Exeter. ""Once microplastics are in the river, they become impossible to remove again, so we have to solve the problem at the source."" Researchers from the NGO tested 13 rivers earlier this year, casting nets in 30 rural and urban areas. They found 1,271 pieces of 15 different types of plastic, nearly half of which were polyethylene, and included items from degraded straws to microbeads. Only two of the ""relatively rural"" 30 areas did not test positive, Greenpeace said in its report, published Wednesday. ""We are witnessing just the tip of a plastics iceberg,"" it said. The nets were only able to collect samples that were no deeper than 10 centimetres (four inches). The impact of microplastics on freshwater fauna has yet to be determined, the study says. The River Mersey in northwest England was the most polluted, with 875 microplastic samples collected in half an hour. That makes it even more proportionally polluted than the ""Great Pacific Garbage Patch"", which is recognised as one of the most plastic-polluted expanses of water on earth, Greenpeace said. It called on the British government to set legally-binding targets to reduce the production of single-use plastic packaging by at least 50 percent by 2025. A ban on the sale of cosmetic and personal hygiene products containing microbeads in the UK came into force in January 2018. Greenpeace urged for an extension of the ban to include other products such as sunscreen, lipstick and other household products.

The amendments are being seen as a bid to facilitate its passage. To provide more protection to American workers, it requires that the employer sponsoring H-1B workers must disclose online (for at least 30 days) various details of the job on offer, such as occupation or job position, education and experience requirements, location and also how to apply for this job. A filing fee is also sought to be introduced forLabour Condition Applications(LCA), which is an attestation-based requirement that has to be met by sponsoring employers prior to filing of H-1B visa applications. This bill was originally introduced in the US Senate on February 7. It sought to remove the per country cap on employment-based green cards and shorten the wait time for the vast majority of applications in the backlog. US issues 1.40 lakh employment-based green cards annually. Substantial increase in denial of H-1B petitions of Indians: Report However, not more than 7% can go to nationals of any one country. With a high influx of the Indian diaspora in the US, it has resulted in a heavy backlog, with those in the EB-2 category (having advanced degrees) having to face a wait time of 151 years. ""Over the last decade, various bills to remove this per country cap, have failed to become law. S. 386 has been rescued from the fate of its predecessors through appeasement, specifically, by agreeing to amendments that would allow further restrictions on merit-based non-immigrant visas, particularly with regards to the H-1B programme. However, it is interesting to note that many of these so-called 'new' restrictions already exist in one form or another,"" Florida based immigration attorney, Ashwin Sharma, told TOI. For instance, even currently, H-1B sponsoring employers have to certify that they are not favouring immigrant workers over American workers. They have to indicate how they calculated the prevailing wages they are offering to H-1B workers (but these records are to be made available only on specific request of the concerned authorities), explained Sharma. While the bill would alleviate the green card backlog and significantly benefit India, followed by China, it also seeks to ensure that the green card for others is not delayed beyond the time it would have otherwise taken, had this bill not been passed. Another similar bill HR 1044, introduced by the Democrats is pending in the US House. 'Immigration Voice', a US based non-profit which is engaged in alleviating problems faced by legal highly-skilled immigrants, in its social media post on June 17, said that it has reached a deal with Senator Lee and the amendments will enable the bill to pass. ""We have a deal to break the deadlock in the Senate!,"" it posted on Twitter. A note, issued by it analysing the various facets of S.386 including the amendments, states that the bill allows investigations against H-1B frauds to be based on anonymous complaints, eliminates arbitrary deadlines on investigations and permits investigations for general non-compliance with LCA requirements, as opposed to simply for a wilful violation. It seeks to increase the penalties for LCA violations that have remained unchanged since 1990. Whistle-blower protection, which is already available, is also incorporated in the amendment. The fee proposed for LCA documentation will be used to fund the department of labour's (DOL's) administrative and investigative activities associated with H-1B programme. A few amendments in the bill, such as the 30 day internet posting requirement, could cause delays and challenges, states an immigration expert. Another counsel says: ""Companies can depute their employees on a B-1 (business) visa to the US for a temporary period. The requirement was that the salary should be borne by the non-US employer. While a B-1 was getting tougher to obtain, it was an option available. The bill seeks to eliminate the 'B-1 in lieu of H-1B' option. We need to see how this will pan out.""

However, former diplomat Thae Yong Ho told reporters in Tokyo that the Kim regime would be safe for at least another decade as the young leader enjoys the loyalty of older generations around him. ""I think that maybe 10 years is too short. I don't think the Kim Jong Un regime will collapse in 10 years. But I don't think Kim Jong Un will continue another 20 years,"" said Thae, who fled his post as the North's deputy ambassador to Britain in August 2016. He added: ""If I am able to live another 20 or 30 years, I think I will be able to walk back to my hometown."" However, he stressed that if Kim's iron-clad rule does come to an end, it will be due to a younger generation coming through rather than an organised coup d'etat or regime change from a foreign power such as the United States. ""At this moment, I think there cannot be any immediate people's uprising or military initiative to remove Kim Jong Un, because the military is not very well organised for that kind of purpose. But I am looking for a change of generations,"" Thae said. The people around Kim are now aged between 60 and 80, however, and change could come when these loyal footsoldiers retire, he predicted. ""When the current generals are all retired and the generals now in their 30s, 40s or 50s are in power, I don't think they will continue to share the same ideology of Kim Jong Un. I'm sure they will say goodbye to Kim Jong Un."" ""Only time can solve the problem."" Thae also said he did not believe that any officials had been executed after the failure of Kim's summit with US President Donald Trump in Hanoi, as was reported. He said some officials may have received ""revolutionary education"" — which he described as ""one or three months work in the countryside and coming back to their post."" ""I think that kind of very slight punishments were applied but there were not executions or purges or shootings because of the Hanoi failure,"" Thae said, partly because Kim was also somewhat to blame. ""If he completely turns this responsibility to other people, it would undermine his credibility and leadership and Kim Jong Un knows that very well,"" said Thae. South Korea's Chosun Ilbo newspaper reported last month that Kim Hyok Chol was sentenced to death for ""betraying the Supreme Leader"" after he was ""won over by the US"" during pre-summit negotiations. Kim has not been mentioned by North Korea's state media since the Hanoi summit, which ended abruptly without an agreement.

Foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt, environment secretary Michael Gove and interior minister Sajid Javid are vying to join Johnson on the ballot paper to be put before 160,000 Conservative Party members. Two rounds of voting are scheduled to whittle the four down to two, though Johnson, barring a spectacular collapse in support, already has more than enough backing to ensure he cruises through. The last two will then face 16 hustings meetings around the country and two televised debates before Tory party members send in their postal votes to pick a new leader. The winner will be announced in the week beginning July 22 and then take over from Theresa May as prime minister. In Wednesday's third ballot of 313 MPs in the governing, centre-right Conservative Party, former foreign secretary Johnson came first with 143 votes, ahead of Hunt on 54, Gove on 51 and Javid on 38. International development minister Rory Stewart was eliminated with 27 votes. Thursday's fourth ballot takes place between 10am and 12pm, with the result declared an hour later. If no candidates withdraw and three remain, MPs are then scheduled to vote again between 3.30pm and 5.30pm. Thursday's double round of voting will see candidates frantically scrambling for their colleagues' support — and arm-twisting galore. Before Wednesday's vote, Stewart said he had been speaking to Gove about potentially joining forces. Hunt has come second to former London mayor Johnson in the first three rounds and pledged: ""If I make it to the final I will put my heart and soul into giving him the contest of his life."" Gove said: ""I'm determined to make this a contest of ideas."" Meanwhile Home Secretary Javid was upbeat, saying: ""We can do this!"" Bookmakers say Johnson has a 10 in 11 chance of becoming the next Conservative leader. May stepped down as Conservative leader earlier this month over her failure to deliver Brexit on time, although she remains prime minister until her successor is chosen. MPs rejected the divorce deal she struck with Brussels three times, shredding her authority. May has not revealed who she has voted for. She has repeatedly told journalists ""none of your business!"" after voting and said she had not even told her husband. However, she is due in Brussels for her last formal European Union summit as prime minister and so would have to vote by proxy in Thursday's second ballot. Finance minister Philip Hammond has also kept mum on who he is backing. All four candidates say they will threaten to leave the EU with ""no deal"" in a bid to change the withdrawal agreement text, which Brussels has so far said will not be reopened. Johnson and Javid insist Britain must leave on the twice-delayed October 31 exit date, while Hunt and Gove are prepared to delay if a divorce deal with Brussels seems close. In his annual Mansion House speech to London banking bigwigs, Chancellor of the Exchequer Hammond will say he cannot imagine any Conservative government ""actively pursuing a no-deal Brexit"". According to his Treasury ministry, he will say it would risk breaking up the United Kingdom, Britain's economic prosperity and a general election that could put Jeremy Corbyn, the main opposition Labour Party's leftist leader, into Downing Street. He will also warn that the incoming premier will face a parliament opposed to both the divorce deal and a no-deal Brexit, and an EU that will not renegotiate — hinting that a second referendum may be required. Hammond was to say: ""If the new prime minister cannot end the deadlock in parliament, then he will have to explore other democratic mechanisms to break the impasse.""

Wang Shoujun, a standing committee member of the China People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), told delegates on Wednesday that China needed to take full advantage of the opportunities provided by ""Belt and Road"" and give more financial and policy support to its nuclear sector. ""'Going out' with nuclear power has already become a state strategy, and nuclear exports will help optimise our export trade and free up domestic high-end manufacturing capacity,"" he was quoted as saying in a report on the CPPCC's official website. He said China needed to improve research and development, localise the production of key nuclear components, and grow both the domestic and foreign nuclear markets to give full play to the country's ""comprehensive advantages"" in costs and technology. Wang, also the former chairman of the state-owned China National Nuclear Corp. (CNNC), said ""Belt and Road"" nuclear projects could earn Chinese firms as much as 1 trillion yuan ($145.52 billion) by 2030, according to more details of his speech published by BJX.com.cn, a Chinese power industry news portal. He said 41 ""Belt and Road"" nations already had nuclear power programmes or were planning to develop them, and China only needed to secure a 20% market share to create five million new jobs in the sector, according to the news portal. CPPCC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. China is in the middle of a reactor-building programme it hoped would serve as a shop window to promote its homegrown designs and technologies overseas, especially its own third-generation reactor design known as Hualong One. But the pace of construction at home has slowed down amid technological problems and delays at some key projects, as well as a suspension of new approvals that lasted over three years. Wang, according to BJX.com.cn, said there was currently overcapacity among local nuclear manufacturers, but the domestic market value for nuclear equipment could reach more than 48 billion yuan a year within two years. He didn't say how much it was worth currently.

Xi is the first Chinese president to visit North Korea in 14 years, after relations between the Cold War era allies deteriorated over Pyongyang's nuclear provocations and Beijing's subsequent backing of UN sanctions. Xi and Kim have been working to repair ties, with the young North Korean leader visiting his older ally four times in China in the past year and Beijing calling for sanctions to be relaxed. But the Chinese leader waited to reciprocate the visit, biding his time to see how nuclear talks between Kim and Trump would play out before deciding to travel to Pyongyang, according to analysts. Xi, who will pay a two-day state visit, arrived in North Korea late Thursday morning, China's CCTV said. He is visiting with his wife Peng Liyuan, foreign minister Wang Yi, and other officials, according to Chinese state media. In Pyongyang, Chinese flags hung throughout the city and residents were lined the streets to welcome Xi. The Rodong Sinmun newspaper, the mouthpiece of the ruling party, devoted the top half of its front page to Xi's visit, with a colour picture of him accompanying a profile. In an editorial, it said his trip will ""engrave a new, enduring page in the history of DPRK-China friendship"". ""The visit to our country that comes despite the emergence of urgent and important tasks due to complex international relations clearly shows that the Chinese party and government are putting high importance on the DPRK-China friendship,"" it went on. ""Our people are proud of having a trustworthy and close friend like the Chinese people."" Authorities have imposed tight control on coverage of the visit. International journalists in Pyongyang were told they would not be able to cover it, while foreign media organisations that were initially invited to attend were unable to obtain visas. Sources say the Chinese media delegation accompanying Xi was also reduced in size from initial plans. The visit will be largely symbolic, with no formal joint communique expected -- as was the case with Kim's April summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Vladivostok, Russia. Analysts say the trip is a chance for China to showcase its influence in the region. ""For North Korea, the coming meeting will serve to show the US that China has its back and to send a message to Washington it should stop its maximum pressure posture,"" said Lim Eul-chul, professor of North Korean studies at Kyungnam University. Negotiations between Trump and Kim soured after a second summit in February broke up without a deal, with the two men failing to agree on what Pyongyang would be willing to give up in exchange for sanctions relief. But Chinese state news agency Xinhua in a commentary published Thursday said ""hope remains alive and kicking"" on resolving the nuclear standoff. In a rare opinion piece published in Rodong Sinmun on Wednesday, Xi hailed the ""irreplaceable"" friendship between North Korea and China and offered a ""grand plan"" to bring permanent stability to East Asia. He also vowed that Beijing would play an active role in ""strengthening communication and coordination with North Korea and other relevant parties"" to push forward negotiations on the Korean Peninsula. After Beijing's own trade negotiations with Washington hit a wall last month, some analysts believe Xi could come back from Pyongyang with leverage for his meeting with Trump at the G20 summit in Japan next week. But Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang has dismissed the suggestion that Beijing's close ties with Pyongyang could be used to pressure the US, saying ""people with such an idea are just over-thinking"". China sees the North as a strategic buffer from South Korea, keeping the 28,500 US troops in South Korea far from its borders, and Xi's trip will include a visit to pay homage at Pyongyang's Friendship Tower, a monument to the Chinese troops who saved the North from defeat during the Korean War. In recent days, soldiers and workers have been sprucing it up before the visit. Beijing has fretted over being sidelined after the North Korean leader agreed to meet Trump last year, with the US leader going as far as declaring he had fallen ""in love"" with Kim. And experts said Xi's editorial was a not-so-subtle reminder that Beijing remains Pyongyang's closest ally. Zhao Tong, North Korea expert at the Carnegie Tsinghua Center think tank in Beijing, said he does not expect any ""substantive discussions"" on denuclearisation during the meeting, because ""China and North Korea do not have enough mutual trust.""

""The president has been briefed on the reports of a missile strike in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia,"" White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in a statement. ""We are closely monitoring the situation and continuing to consult with our partners and allies."" There was no immediate confirmation of the attack from Saudi authorities. Late Wednesday, Yemen's Iran-aligned Huthi rebels said they struck a power station in southern Jizan province, according to the group's Al-Masirah TV. Earlier on Wednesday, a Saudi-led military coalition fighting the rebels said a Huthi drone was intercepted over Yemeni airspace. The rebels, who have faced persistent coalition bombing since March 2015 which has exacted a heavy civilian death toll, have stepped up missile and drone attacks across the border in recent weeks. Last week, a rebel missile attack on the international airport in southern Abha city left 26 civilians wounded, drawing promises of ""stern action"" from the coalition. Human Rights Watch denounced last week's strike as an apparent ""war crime"", urging the Huthis to immediately stop all attacks on civilian infrastructure in Saudi Arabia. The attacks come amid heightened regional tensions with Iran, which Saudi Arabia has repeatedly accused of arming the rebels with sophisticated weapons. Tehran denies the charge. Following recent rebel attacks, Saudi state media has reported the coalition was intensifying its air raids on rebel positions in the northern Yemeni province of Hajjah and the rebel-held capital Sanaa. The coalition intervened in support of the Yemeni government in 2015 when President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi fled into Saudi exile as the rebels closed in on his last remaining territory in and around second city Aden. Since then, the conflict has killed tens of thousands of people, many of them civilians, relief agencies say. It has triggered what the UN describes as the world's worst humanitarian crisis, with more than 24 million Yemenis -- more than two-thirds of the population -- in need of aid.

""The US says it does not rule out the use of force... This would be a disaster for the region,"" Putin said during an annual televised phone-in with screened questions posed by Russian viewers. ""It would lead to a surge in violence and an increase in the number of refugees,"" he said, adding that the consequences of intervention would be ""difficult to calculate"". Moscow has backed Tehran in its stand off with the United States since Washington pulled out of an international 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran last year. Putin repeated Russia's insistence that sanctions against Iran are ""unreasonable"". The comment comes at a time of growing antagonism between Iran and the US following two waves of still unexplained attacks on Gulf shipping, which Washington has blamed on Tehran. Iran has denied any involvement and hinted that the US might have orchestrated them itself to provide a pretext for the use of force against the Islamic republic. On Thursday tensions also heightened after the Pentagon confirmed that Iranian forces had shot down a US naval surveillance drone. The US has insisted the aircraft was in international air space but Iran has said the drone had violated Iranian airspace.

Hajizadeh said that even pilotless drones, like the one shot down on Thursday, had systems to relay warnings and other communications to their operators thousands of kilometres (miles) away in the United States. ""This aircraft possesses a system which allows it to relay the signals and information it receives to its own central system,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, when they failed to reply and the army gave a second appeal at 3:55 am (2325 GMT Wednesday) and they kept on getting nearer and the aircraft made no change to its trajectory, at 4:05 am (2335 GMT) we were obliged to shoot it down."" Hajizadeh stressed that the order was given only after the aircraft had entered Iranian airspace. Thursday's downing -- which Washington insists was above international waters -- has seen tensions between the two countries spike further after a series of attacks on tankers the US has blamed on Iran.

Earlier on Thursday, India said it was in talks with the United States on H-1B visas, but foreign ministry spokesman Raveesh Kumar told a news conference: ""We have not heard anything officially from the US government"" on capping such permits for Indians.

On Thursday, an Iranian missile destroyed a US Global Hawk surveillance drone. Tehran said the drone was shot down over its territory and Washington said it had occurred in international airspace. US President Donald Trump said on Friday he aborted a military strike to retaliate against Iran's downing of the US drone because it could have killed 150 people, and signalled he was open to talks with Tehran. Trump orders strike on Iran, stops it with 10 mins to go Iran has vowed to defend its borders. ""Regardless of any decision they (US officials) make ... we will not allow any of Iran's borders to be violated. Iran will firmly confront any aggression or threat by America,"" foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi told Tasnim.

Tehran has also said it is not seeking a war but has warned of a ""crushing"" response if attacked.

The United States and Iran's main regional rival Saudi Arabia have blamed Iran for attacks on two oil tankers last week in the Gulf of Oman and on four tankers off the United Arab Emirates on May 12, both near the strategic Strait of Hormuz, a major conduit for global oil supplies. Iran has denied any involvement in those incidents. Tensions began to worsen significantly when Trump pulled out of a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six powers and reimposed sanctions on the country. The sanctions had been lifted under the pact in return for Tehran curbing its nuclear programme. Iran has threatened to breach the deal if the European signatories to the deal fail to salvage it by shielding Tehran from US sanctions. ""The Europeans will not be given more time beyond July 8 to save the deal,"" Mousavi said, referring to Iran's deadline of 60 days that Tehran announced in May.

Iran can NEVER have Nuclear Weapons, not against the USA, and not against the WORLD!” Trump added, continuing his administration’s position that Tehran has not given up its pursuit of nuclear weapons as envisaged under a nuclear deal with Iran that his predecessor Barack Obama had engineered with support from European allies. Outlining the hardline position that critics say takes its cue from a like-minded hardline constituency in Israel, Trump accused Obama of making a “desperate and terrible deal with Iran.” Obama, he alleged, “gave them 150 Billion Dollars plus I.8 Billion Dollars in CASH! Iran was in big trouble and he bailed them out. Gave them a free path to Nuclear Weapons, and SOON.” ....proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone.

The US President’s tirade came even as he dialed down talk of war in a message to Iran routed through Oman and sought talks with Tehran, which warned that any attack against it will have regional and international consequences. In earlier remarks at the White House, Trump was exculpatory towards the Iranian leadership, saying the unmanned US drone may have been shot down in error by someone who was acting ""loose and stupid,” possibly a general, and he had a ""big, big feeling"" that someone made a mistake. ""We didn't have a man or woman in the drone. It would have made a big, big difference,"" Trump said, adding, ""This country will not stand for it, that I can tell you."" Iran though claimed the US drone was in its territory and that it in fact it had issued two warnings to the Americans before shooting the spy plane down eight miles from its shores. Trump met with congressional leaders - many of whom are leery of the perceived US warmongering - at the White House on Thursday afternoon. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority leader Chuck Schumer, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell were among those who attended the meeting, which comes amid a reckoning that only Congress is mandated to declare war and Trump has get legislative approval before ordering a full-fledged war. ""The president may not intend to go to war here, but we are worried that he and the administration may bumble into a war. We told the room that the Democratic position is that Congressional approval must be required before funding any conflict in Iran,"" Schumer said. Several Democrats excoriated Trump for a reckless, erratic, and incoherent Iran policy, referring to his penchant for TV reality shows. ""A war with Iran would be a disaster and lead to endless conflict in the region.

There were also no immediate reports of casualties after the earthquake. A shallower 6.3-magnitude hit the area last week, but the damage was not extensive. Indonesia experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activity due to its position on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"", where tectonic plates collide.

""I'm heading to Japan, Osaka. And we are going to be meeting with (leaders from) a lot of different countries, many of whom have been taking advantage of the United States but not so much anymore, and soon not at all anymore,"" Trump told reporters in the South lawns of the White House before boarding Marine One which took him to Andrews Joint Air Force Base for Air Force One for travelling to Japan. Besides Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the US president will meet his Chinese and Russian counterparts Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the G-20 Summit. The White House said Trump and Modi would hold a bilateral meeting on June 28. This would be the third engagement of Trump on Friday, which would start with his meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at 8.30 am local time. Thereafter, Modi would join Abe and Trump for a tri-lateral meeting at 9.15 am. The Trump-Modi bilateral is scheduled to start at 9.35 am. Trump's next engagement is with German Chancellor Angel Merkel at 10.15 am, according to the White House. He will also meet the Russian and Brazilian presidents later in the afternoon. This would be Trump's first meeting with Modi after his recent electoral victory. It comes in the immediate aftermath of the India visit of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, during which he met Modi, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval. The Trump-Modi meeting assumes significance in the wake of the strain that has popped up in the bilateral relationship on a host of trade and economic issues. In his brief interaction with the media on the South Lawns of the White House, Trump did not mention India. ""I'm meeting with (leaders of) many countries. We're meeting with many countries, we have many things. We've been ripped off by everybody over the years. They're not ripping us off anymore. A big difference right now,"" he said. ""We're meeting with China, just so you know, China has been paying us billions and billions of dollars. Until I got here, they never paid this country 10 cents. So, we'll see what happens with China, with Russia, with Japan, with many countries,"" Trump said. Earlier during an interview with Fox news, Trump emphasized on bilateral trade agreements with other countries. This is Trump's second visit to Japan in less than a month. The G20 is an opportunity for world leaders to discuss the biggest challenges facing the global economy, the White House said. Trump's goal this week is to fight for the best deals and outcomes possible to lift up America's workers, it said. A truly level-playing field means breaking down foreign barriers -- both the tariff and non-tariff kind -- that have stifled America's economy and taken away too many jobs, the White House said. ""Unlike his predecessors, Trump is willing to use every tool at his disposal to bring these countries to the negotiating table and agree to better terms for our citizens,” it said. “We are a country that's respected again,” Trump said before boarding Marine One Wednesday afternoon.

Dressed in colourful 'poshaks' and 'safas', several of them travelled from Birmingham, Edinburgh, Manchester and Cardiff to Claremont High School in Kenton, Harrow, to be part of the event. The day-long event provides a platform for the Rajasthanis in UK to connect with each other and to introduce their children to the customs of their home state. The Rajasthani diaspora makes up only a small percentage of Indians in the UK, dominated by Gujaratis and Punjabis. ""I have a sense of pride in representing Rajasthan. I bring my children here so that they can learn things about the home state which they don't get to learn here,"" said 35-year-old Krishna Shekhawat, who hails from Jodhpur. ""We want to inculcate Rajasthani values in our kids so as to help them connect to your roots,"" added Rajeet Singh Rathore, who studies in London and hails from Pali.

It's very difficult to get Rajasthani food in Britain. This reminds us of Rajasthan,"" she said. PIO MP Virendra Sharma, who represents the Ealing Southall constituency which has a large Indian diaspora, said, ""There are two reasons for having this event. One is to highlight the achievements in the society you are living in and the other is to pass on the social values you bring with you to the next generation to make sure they don't forget their culture, traditions, language. There are no Rajasthani MPs in the UK Parliament so we need to encourage them to take part in mainstream politics of Britain and contribute the best practices from their own culture."" Harendra Jodha from Merta, the organiser, said, ""Rajasthanis tend to live in communities in Britain where there are many Gujaratis and Punjabis and merge with them.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 1561607225000 Trump's continued pique over trade issues with India overshadowed efforts by his secretary of state Mike Pompeo who, during a stopover in New Delhi, emphasized the strategic dimension of US-India ties while suggesting differences in trade issues are something that can be lived with when they cannot be overcome. But Trump has consistently undercut his cabinet officials' effort to continue a stable US foreign policy and maintain good ties with allies and partners, with petulant outbursts over relatively trivial issues such as tariffs on Harley Davidson motorcycles, while, in the eyes of analysts, ignoring the big picture. In an oblique swipe at Trump's messaging, which some commentators saw as a pressure tactic before his meeting with Modi, India's new external affairs minister S Jaishankar tweeted, ""India-US relations are guided by the Big Picture- the Vision set out by our leaders,PM Modi & President Trump in 2017. Specific issues will arise & they will be considered within the Framework of this Big Picture. We agreed to filter out the noise & work on our solid relationship.""

Jaishankar (@DrSJaishankar) 1561545976000 However the Trump who purportedly set the ""Big Picture Vision"" is a frequent victim of the Trump who has an obsessive compulsive disorder when it comes to trade. He has repeatedly twitted Modi over Twitter on trade issues even while affirming their friendship even though India is a relatively minor trading partner of the United States. That friendship will be put to test when the two leaders meet bilaterally in Osaka in an engagement for which schedulers appear to have left a 40-minute slot, sandwiched between a 20-minute trilateral meeting between Trump, Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and another bilateral with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. In fact, along with India, Japan and Germany were also subjected to a Trump twitter-lashing ahead of the summit. He complained that under existing treaty provisions, if the United States were attacked, Japan would only ""watch it on a Sony television,"" and he called Germany a security freeloader. ""Let me start off with general statement -- almost all countries in this world take tremendous advantage (of the US}"", Trump complained during a phone interview on Fox Business. Many U.S analysts and historians have pointed out that the Trump either does not know or ignores historical events relating to World War Two that compelled Germany and Japan to accept US security umbrella. The President's critics also pointed out that in contrast with his rants against allies and partners, Trump refrained from any criticism of Russia and its leader Vladimir Putin, who are accused of manipulating the 2016 US Presidential election to favor Trump, and Saudi Arabia, whose leader is said to be responsible for the death of a dissident columnist and who has close business ties with the Trump family. Trump's critique of India's tariff hike ignored, willfully or otherwise, the basis for it: New Delhi raised raised tariff's on 28 categories of imports in retaliation to the US increasing tariffs on aluminum and steel, and its revocation of a preferential trade status for more than $5 billion in imports from India.

The not-for-profit Taraki was listed on Tuesday as a finalist in the Influencer of the Year category of the 7th British Indian Awards, which recognise a wide range of achievements of the diaspora. British Punjabi Shuranjeet Singh Takhar, founder and director of Taraki, posted a statement on Twitter explaining that he was “withdrawing Taraki from this opportunity” owing to the “influencer” tag ascribed to Taraki, as well as the term “British Indian” which he said was “an incredibly loaded label”. “Such labels are not devoid of political turbulence,” he wrote. “My understanding of 20th-century histories on the South Asian subcontinent paints a bleak picture for human rights with intense discrimination existing along lines of gender, religion and caste. Events such as the 1992 demolition of the Babri Masjid, the 2002 anti-Muslim riots in Gujarat, and the sustained state genocide against Sikh communities spanning several decades show, in my view, how India has failed to adequately meet the needs of minority communities. To present day, individuals are discriminated against based on race, gender, caste, religion, and more complex intersections,” Takhar said. “If one is labelled an ‘influencer’ we believe that others are seen as ‘influenced’. I do not feel comfortable identifying myself or Taraki as an ‘influencer’ or a movement identified as ‘British Indian’,” he concluded. The awards ceremony will take place at the Holiday Inn in Birmingham on July 26. It is organised by a private company, Oceanic Consulting. A spokesperson for Oceanic Consulting said: “We are very sorry to hear that Taraki do not wish to be recognised for the great work they do within the Punjabi community. Since we launched the ceremony hundreds of British men and women of Indian descent have been recognised for the amazing contribution they have made to life in the UK.” In the last UK census in 2011, 83,362 people refused to select “British Indian” as their ethnicity and instead handwrote “Sikh”. That spurred a plethora of British Sikh organisations and gurdwaras in May to launch a legal challenge to the Cabinet Office's proposals for the 2021 census over its failure to include a Sikh ethnic tick box. Dr Rami Ranger, chairman of Sun Mark Ltd, said he felt Taraki’s move was short-sighted. “The award would have raised the profile of the charity and highlighted their sterling work. Sadly, Taraki is now attracting negative publicity rather than getting applauded for their good work,” he said.

The White House confirmation came a day after the State Department had said it had no idea about the upcoming visit -- first reported in the Pakistani media - causing discomfiture in the Islamabad establishment that had leaked reports of the upcoming trip. However, the White House announcement of the visit indicated that the issue of terrorism, instability, and violence will dominate the conversation given Pakistan's destabilising role in the region, including in Afghanistan and India. ""The visit will focus on strengthening cooperation between the United States and Pakistan to bring peace, stability, and economic prosperity to a region that has seen far too much conflict. President Trump and Prime Minister Khan will discuss a range of issues, including counterterrorism, defense, energy, and trade, with the goal of creating the conditions for a peaceful South Asia and an enduring partnership between our two countries,"" the statement from the White House Press Secretary said. Khan is expected to be in the US for three days in an effort to restore Pakistan’s frayed ties with the US that went further south after Trump came to office. The US President, clearly not a fan of Pakistan, has repeatedly berated Islamabad for taking American money and not doing anything for the US. “We paid Pakistan Billions of Dollars & they never told us he was living there. Fools!” he said in one tweet, referring to Osama bin Laden being found in a hideout in Abbottabad. After cutting off $1.6 in military aid to Pakistan, he told Fox News, “They don't do anything for us, they don't do a damn thing for us."" Trump's attack also brought a sharp retort from Imran Khan, who maintained that Pakistan was the victim of over 75,000 deaths and lost over $123 billion because of the United State’s “War on Terror”, though no Pakistani nationals were involved in the plot and execution of the tragic events of 9/11. “Record needs to be put straight on Mr Trump's tirade against Pakistan: 1. No Pakistani was involved in 9/11 but Pak decided to participate in US War on Terror. 2. Pakistan suffered 75,000 casualties in this war & over $123 bn was lost to economy. US ""aid"" was a miniscule $20 bn,” he tweeted. “Instead of making Pakistan a scapegoat for their failures, the US should do a serious assessment of why, despite 140000 NATO troops plus 250,000 Afghan troops & reportedly $1 trillion spent on war in Afghanistan, the Taliban today are stronger than before,” Khan taunted over Twitter. For now though the two sides appeared to have put aside the spat and are getting ready to reset ties – with some help from Senator Lindsey Graham, member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a close Trump associate - -partly on account of the US need to exit from Afghanistan. It is Graham, who was once a “never-Trumper” and called Trump the “world’s biggest jackass,” who visited Pakistan in January this year and began pushing the US President to meet Khan, ostensibly after assessing the ground situation in the region. In fact, Khan is coming to the US with top military aides, suggesting there will be some effort at restoring defense ties that have gone off the rails although Pakistan is too broke to buy any American military hardware.

The study is part of a series of tests given to the sheep to monitor their cognitive abilities. Due to their relatively large size of their brains and their longevity, sheep are a good animal model for studying neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington's disease, according to scientists from the University of Cambridge in the UK. Researchers trained eight sheep to recognise the faces of four celebrities - Fiona Bruce, Jake Gyllenhaal, Barak Obama and Emma Watson - from photographic portraits displayed on computer screens. Training involved the sheep making decisions as they moved around a specially-designed pen. At one end of the pen, they would see two photographs displayed on two computer screens and would receive a reward of food for choosing the photograph of the celebrity. If they chose the wrong photograph, a buzzer would sound and they would receive no reward. Over time, they learn to associate a reward with the celebrity's photograph. After training, the sheep were shown two photographs - the celebrity's face and another face. Sheep correctly chose the learned celebrity face eight times out of ten. In these initial tests, the sheep were shown the faces from the front, but to test how well they recognised the faces, the researchers next showed them the faces at an angle. As expected, the sheep's performance dropped, but only by about 15 per cent - a figure comparable to that seen when humans perform the task. Finally, the researchers looked at whether sheep were able to recognise a handler from a photograph without pre- training. The handlers typically spend two hours a day with the sheep and so the sheep are very familiar with them. When a portrait photograph of the handler was interspersed randomly in place of the celebrity, the sheep chose the handler's photograph over the unfamiliar face seven out of ten times. During this final task the researchers observed an interesting behaviour. Upon seeing a photographic image of the handler for the first time the sheep did a 'double take'. The sheep checked first the (unfamiliar) face, then the handler's image, and then unfamiliar face again before making a decision to choose the familiar face, of the handler. ""Anyone who has spent time working with sheep will know that they are intelligent, individual animals who are able to recognise their handlers,"" said Professor Jenny Morton, who led the study published in the journal Royal Society: Open Science. ""We've shown with our study that sheep have advanced face-recognition abilities, comparable with those of humans and monkeys,"" Morton said.
