Cassidy"|"While candidates were focused on campaigning in 2016, Russians were carrying out a devastating cyber-operation that changed the landscape of American politics, with aftershocks continuing well into Donald Trump’s presidency. And it all started with the click of a tempting email and a typed-in password. Whether presidential campaigns have learned from the cyberattacks is a critical question ahead as the 2020 election approaches. Preventing the attacks won’t be easy or cheap. “If you are the Pentagon or the NSA, you have the most skilled adversaries in the world trying to get in but you also have some of the most skilled people working defence,” said Robby Mook, who ran the Clinton campaign in 2016. “Campaigns are facing similar adversaries and they don’t have similar resources and virtually no expertise.” Traditionally, cybersecurity has been a lower priority for candidates, especially at the early stages of a campaign. They need to raise money, hire staff, pay office rents, lobby for endorsements and travel repeatedly to early voting states. Particularly during primary season, campaign managers face difficult spending decisions: Air a TV ad targeting a key voting demographic or invest in a more robust security system for computer networks? “You shouldn’t have to choose between getting your message out to voters and keeping the Chinese from reading your emails,” said Mook, now a senior fellow with the Defending Digital Democracy Project at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center. He has been helping develop a plan for a non-profit to provide cybersecurity support and resources directly to campaigns. The Department of Homeland Security’s cyber agency is offering help, and there are signs that some Democratic campaigns are willing to take the uncomfortable step of working with an administration they are trying to unseat. DHS has had about a dozen initial discussions with campaigns so far, officials said. Its focus has been on establishing trust so DHS can share intelligence about possible threats and receive information from the campaigns in return, said Matt Masterson, a senior DHS cybersecurity adviser. The department also will test a campaign’s or party’s networks for vulnerabilities to cyberattack. “The challenge for a campaign is they really are a pop-up,” Masterson said. “They have people coming in and coming out, and they have to manage access.” It’s not clear how much campaigns are spending on cybersecurity. From January to March, 12 Democratic campaigns and Trump spent at least $960,000 total on technology-related items, but that also includes technology not related to security, such as database or website services. Former congressman John Delaney, the first Democrat to declare his candidacy for president, said he viewed cybersecurity as a fixed expense. “It’s not supercomputers cracking through your firewalls,” he said. “It’s really tempting emails that people respond to and give away information.” Candidates can get some advice from the Republican and Democratic national committees, which are in regular contact with Homeland Security and focus on implementing basic security protocols. RNC press secretary Blair Ellis said the group also works with state Republican parties and emphasizes training. The organization is also developing an internal platform to share real-time threat information with state parties. “Data security remains a top priority for the RNC,” she said. The DNC last year hired Bob Lord, formerly head of Yahoo’s information security. He has created a checklist that focuses on basics: password security, web encryption and social media privacy. This is a bigger priority than talking about the latest network protection gadget. “What’s new and interesting is fine, but it’s really just about being incredibly single-minded about the basics,” Lord said. “It’s not glamorous, but neither is the advice for staying fit.” The 2016 attacks were low-tech, with Russian agents sending hundreds of spearfishing emails to the personal and work emails of Clinton campaign staffers and volunteers, along with people working for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic National Committee. After an employee clicked and gave up password information, the Russians gained access to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s networks and eventually exploited that to gain entry to the Democratic National Committee. Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, fell for the same trick on his personal email account, which allowed Russians to steal thousands of messages about the inner workings of the campaign. But it wasn’t as if the Clinton campaign ignored cybersecurity. Mook said training was extensive on cyber threats, two-factor authentication was mandatory, and multiple fake emails were sent to test staffers’ ability to detect phishing attempts. The relative ease with which Russian agents penetrated computers underscores the perilous situation facing campaigns. Clinton has been talking about this with Democratic presidential candidates. “Unless we know how to protect our election from what happened before and what could happen again … you could lose,” Clinton said in a MSNBC interview. “I don’t mean it to scare everybody. But I do want every candidate to understand this remains a threat.” California Sen. Kamala Harris’ campaign said it also was preaching the basics of cybersecurity with staff, such as requiring two-factor authentication and using encrypted messaging. “All staff is being trained on threats and ways to avoid being a target,” Harris spokesman Ian Sams said. Others running in the Democratic primary avoided discussing the topic. Some campaigns, including those for Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand and Bernie Sanders, would not comment. The campaigns of Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Beto O’Rourke didn’t respond to requests for comment. Trump’s re-election campaign wouldn’t talk either. The president has often downplayed Russia’s interference in 2016. And his staff told former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen not to bring up election security during her meetings with him — saying she should focus on border security, his signature issue, according to people familiar with the discussions who were not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. But administration officials insist election security is a priority. “We’re all in in protecting 2020,” Chris Krebs, head of DHS’ cyber efforts, told lawmakers Tuesday at a House committee hearing-. “I’d ask, each of you: Do you know if your campaign is working with us?” "|"Preventing cyber attacks during 2020 election won’t be easy"|"2019-05-03T00:41:45-0400"|"International,Politics,cybersecurity,Department of Homeland Security,Donald Trump,campaign,security,people,priority,staff,campaigns,clinton,basics,Chris Krebs,Bob Lord",

Hong Kong stocks climbed 0.4 percent, the Australian market gained 0.1 percent, while Korea’s KOSPI slipped 0.5 percent and New Zealand shares eased 0.3 percent. China and Japan remained closed for holidays and will re-open on Monday and Tuesday, respectively. European stocks are set to open higher, with London’s FTSE futures up 0.2 percent and German DAX futures up 0.1 percent. Overnight on Wall Street, major indices, gave up initial gains and closed in the red, weighed down by energy shares. Oil prices plunged after U.S. crude production output set a new record, though the losses were capped by the intensifying political crisis in Venezuela and the stopping of Iranian oil sanction waivers by Washington. U.S. crude was down 0.3 percent at $61.65 a barrel while Brent slipped 0.5 percent to $70.42. Investors await U.S. employment figures due later in the day, which is forecast to show 185,000 net new jobs were added in April and the unemployment rate steady at 3.8 percent. A report by a payrolls processor on Wednesday showed U.S. private employers added 275,000 jobs last month. A solid official reading would bolster the notion the world’s biggest economy is on track for its longest expansion ever, further boosting the greenback and prospects for corporate earnings. “There’ll be more than one eye on what the report says about average earnings growth that’s expected to grow a meager 0.1 percent,” said National Australia Bank economist David de Garis. Global policymakers are grappling with tepid wage growth and lukewarm inflation despite a surge in jobs and still strong economic expansion, complicating monetary policy decision-making. World stocks have rallied hard this year - the S&P 500 has climbed more than 16 percent so far in 2019 - but further gains will be hard to come by, analysts at Capital Economics said. They forecast the S&P 500 would drop to 2,300 points by Christmas from current levels of just under 2,900, with GDP growth in advanced economies slowing to 1 percent in 2020, down from 2.2 percent in 2018. “Investors are still too optimistic about the outlook for earnings growth. As earnings disappoint, we think that stock markets will drop around the world.” At the same time, investors are “not willing to be too skeptical because there might be a (U.S.-China) trade agreement on the way,” said Ben Kwong, head of research at KGI Asia. The two sides are reportedly near a deal after talks in Beijing this week. PRESSURE DOWN UNDER In the currency markets, Australian and New Zealand dollars fell in early trade as speculators wagered both countries could see interest cuts next week. The Aussie slipped below psychological support of $0.7000 overnight to the lowest since early January while the kiwi dollar drifted closer to a recent five-month trough of $0.6581. The weakness in the antipodean currencies also came as the U.S. dollar gained on remarks by U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell earlier this week that a recent weakness in inflation owed to “transitory” factors. That led traders to start paring expectations for a Fed rate cut. Futures now imply about a 49 percent probability of an easing at year-end, down from 61 percent late on Wednesday, according to CME Group’s FedWatch program. The dollar index held at 97.842, inching towards a two-year peak of 98.33 touched last week. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar was little changed at 111.48 having spent the entire week in a tight 111.03-111.89 range. Spot gold was 0.2 percent higher at $1,271.43 an ounce.

"3"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-new-zealand-prime-minister-jacinda-ardern-engaged-to-long-time-partner/"|""|"New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is engaged to her long-time partner, fishing-show host Clarke Gayford, after a proposal over the Easter holidays, her spokesman said on Friday. The forthcoming nuptials are a rarity for world leaders in office and follow Ms. Ardern’s pregnancy last year which was seen around the globe as a symbol of progress for female leaders. She is only the second elected leader to give birth while in office, after Pakistan’s Benazir Bhutto in 1990 and, if she marries while in office, will be the first major leader to do so since French President Nicolas Sarkozy wed Carla Bruni in 2008. Her fiancé, Mr. Gayford, is a 41-year-old host of a television fishing show who takes care of their 10-month-old daughter Neve Te Aroha, while Ms. Ardern, 38, runs the country. News of their engagement broke after journalists noticed Ms. Ardern wearing a ring on her middle finger at a public event on Friday. Her spokesman Andrew Campbell confirmed she had been wearing the ring since Easter. He did not give details of the proposal. Ms. Ardern was asked by the BBC while visiting London in January if she would consider asking Mr. Gayford to marry her or wait for him to propose. “Absolutely, I’m a feminist, but I want to put him through the pain and torture of having to agonize about that question himself. That’s letting him off the hook, absolutely not,” she said jokingly. The couple met about six years ago when Mr. Gayford went to complain to a member of Parliament about the then National Party government’s proposed changes to security legislation. He bumped into Ms. Ardern, a rising star in the Labour Party, they had coffee and were living together not long after. Mr. Gayford’s television show, Fish of the Day, takes him around the Pacific, fishing and finding recipes for his catch. The series has been sold to 20 countries and won a gold award at the Houston International Film Festival in 2016. While Ms. Ardern was breastfeeding her infant daughter, the family travelled to New York for the United Nations General Assembly last September. The family divides their time between the capital Wellington and Auckland, where they own a house in a central city suburb. Ms. Ardern’s calm and compassionate response to the killing of 51 Muslims in March burnished the credentials of a leader who has been criticized domestically over her handling of the economy and flip flops in government policy. Three U.S. presidents married in office, according to the White House historical association, wartime leader Woodrow Wilson and two nineteenth century presidents, widower John Tyler and Grover Cleveland, who married at the White House.

The India Meteorological Department said the “extremely severe” cyclone in the Bay of Bengal hit the coastal state of Odisha around 8 a.m., with weather impacted across the Asian subcontinent. Dust storms were forecast in the desert state of Rajasthan bordering Pakistan, heat waves in the coastal state of Maharashtra on the Arabian Sea, heavy rain in the northeastern states bordering China and snowfall in the Himalayas. Around 1.2 million people were evacuated from low-lying areas of Odisha and moved to nearly 4,000 shelters, according to India’s National Disaster Response Force. Indian officials put the navy, air force, army and coast guard on high alert. Odisha Special Relief Commissioner Bishnupada Sethi said the evacuation effort was unprecedented in India. By Friday afternoon, Fani had weakened to a “very severe” storm as it hovered over coastal Odisha and was forecast to move north-northeast toward the Indian state of West Bengal by Friday evening. In Bhubaneswar, a city in Odisha famous for an 11th-century Hindu temple, palm trees whipped back and forth like mops across skies made opaque by gusts of rain. It is a “very, very scary feeling,” said Tanmay Das, a 40-year-old resident who described “the sound of wind as if it will blow you away.” Most of the area’s thatched-roof houses were destroyed, and there was no electricity. The national highway to Puri, a popular tourist beach city with other significant Hindu antiquities, was littered with fallen trees and electricity poles and a blue highway sign, making it impassable. A special train ran Thursday to evacuate tourists from the city. The airport in Calcutta, the capital of West Bengal, closed from 3 p.m. Friday to Saturday morning, and rail lines were closed. At least 200 trains were cancelled across India. The storm hit in the middle of India’s six-week general election, with rain forecast in Calcutta forcing political parties to cancel campaign events. The National Disaster Response Force dispatched 54 rescue and relief teams of doctors, engineers and deep-sea divers to flood-prone areas along the coast and as far afield as the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a group of islands that comprise a union territory about 1,300 kilometres east of mainland India in the Bay of Bengal. Up to 10 centimetres of rain were expected in much of Sri Lanka, the island country off the eastern tip of India. More than 2,300 kilometres away on Mount Everest, some mountaineers and Sherpa guides were descending to lower camps as weather worsened at higher elevations. The government issued a warning that heavy snowfall was expected in the higher mountain areas with rain and storms lower down, and asked trekking agencies to take tourists to safety. Hundreds of climbers, their guides, cooks and porters huddled at the Everest base camp, according to Pemba Sherpa of Xtreme Climbers Trek, who said weather and visibility was poor. May is the best month to climb the 8,850-metre Everest when Nepal experiences a few windows of good weather to scale the peak. “It is still the beginning of the month, so there is no reason for climbers to worry” that weather from the cyclone will cost them their chance to reach the summit, Mr. Sherpa said. On India’s cyclone scale, Fani is the second-most severe, equivalent to a Category 3 hurricane. Its timing is unusual, according to data from the Meteorological Department. Most extremely severe cyclones hit India’s east coast in the postmonsoon season. Over roughly half a century, 23, or nearly 60 per cent, of the cyclones to hit India were observed between October and December. Because Fani spent 10 days gathering strength over the sea, it delivered a huge blow when it made landfall. Some of the deadliest tropical cyclones on record have occurred in the Bay of Bengal. A 1999 “super” cyclone killed around 10,000 people and devastated large parts of Odisha. Because of improved forecasts and better co-ordinated disaster management, the death toll from Cyclone Phailin, an equally intense storm that hit in 2013, was less than 50, according to the World Meteorological Organization. The 1999 cyclone reached wind speeds of 260-280 km/h, India Meteorological Department scientist Mrutyunjay Mohapatra said. “This is not as bad,” he said. “Apart from these winds which may cause damage in terms of uprooting small trees in West Bengal and some big trees in Odisha and extensive damage to thatched houses and mud houses ... [and] disruption of power and telecommunication lines,” Mr. Mohapatra said, “it can also impact the rail and road traffic and also air traffic for some time.” Mr. Sethi, the special commissioner in Odisha, said communications were disrupted in some areas, but no deaths or injuries had been reported. In the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh just south of Odisha, Fani topped electricity poles and uprooted others, leaving them in sharp angles. In the Srikakulam district, where around 20,000 people were evacuated, thatched-roof houses collapsed and fishing boats left unmoored on beaches were sliced into shards. The district experienced wind speeds of 140 km/h and received heavy rains, but no loss of life or major damage was reported, district collector J. Niwas said. Authorities in Bangladesh evacuated about 400,000 people and took them to cyclone shelters — decades-old, raised concrete structures — as the weather office forecast that the storm would cross the country’s vast southwestern coastal region by midnight. The world’s largest mangrove forest, Sundarbans, is located in the region. Shah Kamal, a Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief official, said Friday in the capital, Dhaka, that members of the navy and coast guard, as well as police and volunteers, were working around the clock to help with evacuations and stocking emergency supplies of dry food and medicine. “But I think we will not be affected severely given the weakening force of the Cyclone Fani,” he said. Operations of water vessels in Bangladesh, which is crisscrossed by about 130 rivers, were suspended since Thursday. Local media reports said at least 10 villages had been inundated with water in coastal Patuakhali district in southern Bangladesh after flood embankments were breached by the force of the cyclone. Authorities also halted activities at Chittagong Seaport, which handles 80 per cent of the country’s overseas trade. Aid agencies warned that more than one million Rohingya from Myanmar living at refugee camps near the coastal district of Cox’s Bazar were at risk. Hillol Sobhan, local communications director for the aid group Care, said it had emergency supplies for refugees. Police used hand-held microphones to clear people off a beach in Cox’s Bazar and hoisted red flags near the choppy sea.

"5"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-north-koreas-poor-harvest-sparks-food-crisis-un/"|"Tom Miles"|"Four in ten North Koreans are chronically short of food and further cuts to already minimal rations are expected after the worst harvest in a decade, the United Nations said on Friday. Official rations are down to 300 grams per person per day, the lowest ever for this time of year, the UN said following a food security assessment it carried out at Pyongyang’s request from March 29 to April 12. It found that 10.1 million people were suffering from severe food insecurity, “meaning they do not have enough food till the next harvest,” UN World Food Program spokesman Herve Verhoosel said. North Korea’s population is around 25.2 million, according to its Central Bureau of Statistics, the report said. Mr. Verhoosel said the word “famine” was not being used in the current crisis, but it might come to that in a few months or years. “The situation is very serious today -- that’s a fact.” The country suffered a famine in the mid-1990s believed to have killed as many as 3 million people. For its assessment the WFP, one of only a few aid agencies with access to the country, gained widespread entry to farms, households, nurseries and food distribution centres. Mr. Verhoosel blamed a combination of dry spells, heat waves and flooding for the new crisis, which the U.S. State Department said was the government’s fault. “The DPRK regime continues to exploit, starve, and neglect its own people in order to advance its unlawful nuclear and weapons program,” a department spokeswoman said, adding that it could meet its people’s needs if it redirected state funds. After a second summit with U.S. President Donald Trump failed to produce a deal to end its nuclear program in return for sanctions relief, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un set a year-end deadline for Washington to show more flexibility. North Korea has for years relied on regular supplies of UN food aid. Its agricultural output of 4.9-million tons was the lowest since 2008-2009, leading to a food deficit of 1.36 million tonnes in the 2018/2019 marketing year, the WPF report said. Prospects for the 2019 early season crops of wheat and barley were worrisome. “The effects of repeated climate shocks are compounded by shortages of fuel, fertiliser and spare parts crucial for farming,” Mr. Verhoosel said. The WFP plans to make another assessment during July and August.

"6"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-scientology-cruise-ship-leaves-st-lucia-after-measles-quarantine/"|"Brendan O'Brien"|"A cruise ship quarantined for a reported case of measles left the Caribbean island of St. Lucia late on Thursday after health officials provided 100 doses of vaccine to the ship, media reports said. The Church of Scientology cruise ship was confined in port this week by island health officials after the highly contagious disease was detected on board. CNN reported the ship had left St. Lucia, and online ship traffic data showed that the vessel was under way and headed for the island of Curacao. One case of measles had been confirmed on the ship docked in port near the capital of Castries since Tuesday, Dr. Merlene Frederick-James, St. Lucia’s chief medical officer, said in a video statement. “The confirmed case as well as other crew members are presently stable, but remain under surveillance by the ship’s doctor,” she said, noting the incubation period of measles is 10 to 12 days before symptoms appear. The number of measles cases in the United States has reached a 25-year peak with more than 700 people diagnosed as of this week, part of an international resurgence in the disease. NBC News, citing a St. Lucia Coast Guard sergeant, reported the ship is named Freewinds, which is the name of a 440-foot vessel owned and operated by the Church of Scientology. According to Reuters Eikon shipping data, a Panamanian-flagged cruise liner identified as SMV Freewinds had been docked in port near Castries on Thursday. It was now at sea and expected to arrive at Curacao on Saturday. On its website, the Church of Scientology describes the Freewinds as a floating “religious retreat ministering the most advanced level of spiritual counselling in the Scientology religion.” Church officials did not respond to requests for comment. NBC News reported that nearly 300 passengers and crew were aboard the vessel, with one female crew member diagnosed with measles. Public health officials blame declining vaccination rates in some communities driven by misinformation about inoculation that has left those populations vulnerable to rapid spread of infection among those with no immunity to the virus. The vast majority of U.S. cases have occurred in children who have not received vaccines against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR), officials said.

"7"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-antiretroviral-aids-therapy-prevents-transmission-of-hiv-in-gay-men/"|"Kate Kelland"|"A European study of nearly 1,000 gay male couples who had sex without condoms – where one partner had HIV and was taking antiretroviral drugs to suppress it – has found the treatment can prevent sexual transmission of the virus. After eight years of follow-up of the so-called serodifferent couples, the study found no cases at all of HIV transmission within couples. The study proves, the researchers said, that using antiretroviral therapy (ART) to suppress the AIDS virus to undetectable levels also means it cannot be passed on via sex, the researchers said. “Our findings provide conclusive evidence for gay men that the risk of HIV transmission with suppressive ART is zero,” said Alison Rodger, a professor at University College London who co-led the research. She said this “powerful message” could help end the HIV pandemic by preventing the virus’s transmission in high-risk populations. In this study alone, for example, the researchers estimate that the suppressive-antiretroviral treatment prevented around 472 HIV transmissions during the eight years. The study, published in the Lancet medical journal on Thursday, assessed the risk of HIV transmission between serodifferent gay male couples – where one partner is HIV-positive and one is HIV-negative – who do not use condoms. Its findings add to an earlier phase of the study that looked at HIV transmission risk for serodifferent heterosexual couples in the same circumstances. It also found zero risk. While 15 of the men among the 972 gay couples in this phase did become infected with HIV during the eight years of follow-up, genetic testing showed their infections were with strains of HIV acquired from another sexual partner. Since the start of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s, more than 77 million people have become infected with HIV. Almost half of them – 35.4 million – have died of AIDS. Global health experts say the fight against HIV is at a precarious point, with the annual number of AIDS deaths falling and the number of people getting antiretroviral treatment rising, but the number of new infections is stubbornly high at around 1.8 million new cases a year worldwide. Rachel Baggaley, the World Health Organization’s co-ordinator for HIV prevention and testing, said this latest study “adds to the clear and consistent evidence” that HIV transmission to sexual partners does not occur when someone with HIV is on antiretroviral therapy and their virus is suppressed. “Increasing access to HIV testing [and] ART … remains critical for individuals and is central to the HIV public health response,” she said.

"8"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-italy-emerges-as-ground-zero-for-a-wave-of-far-right-populism-ahead-of/"|"Colleen Barry"|"Italy’s populist interior minister is uniting Europe’s right-wing parties under an anti-migrant, anti-Islam, anti-bureaucracy banner for this month’s European Union elections, pledging to reshape the continent from its technocratic heart in the EU’s base in Brussels. The latest target of Matteo Salvini’s wooing: Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. The two bonded over a shared vision for a Europe with sturdy borders during a visit to Hungary by Mr. Salvini that included a tour of razor-wire fences Mr. Orban had built in 2015 to keep out asylum-seekers. Frans Timmerman, a Dutch politician who is second in command of the EU’s executive arm and running to be elected president, called the Salvini-Orban meeting “a love scene … based on family values but which means discrimination.” Mr. Salvini, who became a cabinet minister last year when his League party formed a coalition government with the populist 5-Star Movement, attracted Mr. Orban’s admiration for closing Italian ports to humanitarian rescue ships carrying migrants picked up at sea. Mr. Salvini’s influence is clear in the growth of a euroskeptic political group in the European Parliament, Europe of Nations and Freedom, or ENF. The group counts far-right movements such as France’s National Rally and the Netherlands’ Forum for Democracy at its core, and has expanded to include Alternative for Germany alongside more moderate Nordic parties. Mr. Salvini is set to close out the campaign for the May 23-26 EU Parliament elections with other right-wing populist leaders in Milan’s Duomo Square on May 18. Speaking in Hungary, Mr. Salvini said that after the elections, “a new history will open for Europe and the people of Europe.” Mr. Orban’s Fidesz party has until now been a member of the more moderate European People’s Party alliance, the biggest group in the European Parliament, but that position is becoming increasingly strained. Fidesz was recently suspended from the group over concerns that Hungary has become less democratic under Mr. Orban’s government. Mr. Orban demurred when asked if his party would join ENF, but his intention to court Mr. Salvini seems clear. He told Italian daily newspaper La Stampa that while former Premier Silvio Berlusconi, a stalwart in the group that suspended Fidesz, remains his “best friend” in Italy, Mr. Salvini is the future. “Salvini’s role is more important,” he told the newspaper. Mr. Salvini is pledging to put politics at the centre of EU decision-making and to sideline bureaucrats in Brussels who, he says, set policies without consideration for what the majority of Europeans want. “This is a strong alliance that has never existed before. I wouldn’t define it as the right, but as an alternative to bureaucrats,” Mr. Salvini said while in Budapest. The elections could make Mr. Salvini’s League the single largest party represented in the European Parliament, a prospect that has even conservative movements from outside Europe seeing him as someone to court ahead of the elections. Former White House adviser Steve Bannon, an admirer of Mr. Salvini, is setting up an academy for future populist leaders at a monastery near Rome, despite intense local opposition. Mr. Salvini also attended the annual World Congress of Families when it was held in Verona at the end of March. The ultraconservative coalition based in the United States has anti-abortion and LGBTQ-hostile positions that contrast with Mr. Salvini’s more liberal views, but playing a wide field gives him cachet with socially conservative Italian voters. Some analysts say the European Parliament vote, typically not of much interest to voters, is shaping up to be the most consequential in two decades. “The European elections are offering the opportunity to export the Salvini brand abroad, so bringing in these people, discussions and themes which are fairly controversial helps his message. He is trying to bring to Europe what he brings to Italy in terms of sovereign-based politics,” said Wolfango Piccoli, co-president at Teneo consultancy. The League is forecast to win as much as 32.3 per cent of the EU Parliament vote in Italy, according to the SWG polling agency. That compares with 22.5 per cent for its governing coalition partner, the 5-Star Movement and 21.5 per cent for the opposition Democratic Party, according to the same data. Any gains by the League are likely to be leveraged on a national rather than Europewide level, experts said, because of difficulties the parties in the Europe of Nations and Freedom group have had finding common ground on key issues, including monetary policy and climate change, despite agreement on immigration. While the ENF’s influence is sure to expand in these elections “the question is, can they work together to maximize the leverage? They have struggled in the past,” Mr. Piccoli said. And the other question falls on Mr. Salvini: “Can he become a leader of a united right-wing front in Parliament?” "|"Italy emerges as ground zero for wave of far-right populism ahead of EU elections"|"2019-05-03T09:36:20-0400"|"salvini,orban,league party,italy,far-right,nationalism,european union,europe,group,cent,Mr Salvini,party,mr salvini,question,hungary", 
"9"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-democrats-threaten-contempt-for-william-barr-over-robert-mueller/"|"Mary Clare Jalonick"|"Democrats are splintered by calls to impeach U.S. President Donald Trump. But they have found another common enemy and an alternate political foil in Attorney-General William Barr. Calls for Mr. Barr’s resignation erupted across the Democratic Party this week after he testified before the Senate and rebuffed the House twice, first by denying Democrats a full, unredacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report, and then by skipping a hearing to review it. In response, Democrats threatened to hold Mr. Barr in criminal contempt of Congress – a lengthy legal process that could go on for months. The feud with Mr. Barr has animated Democrats and temporarily shifted attention away from impeachment – and by extension, the party’s divisions over whether to pursue it. But with Mr. Trump resisting other congressional investigations, and testimony from Mr. Mueller likely on the horizon, the impeachment question seems unlikely to subside for long. For now, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, who would lead impeachment proceedings, are putting their emphasis on investigating Mr. Trump, his business dealings and his administration. If Democrats do decide to impeach the President, they will have already made part of the case through oversight. Mr. Trump’s refusal to comply with their requests – with Mr. Barr just the latest example – will only strengthen the case. “Impeachment is never off the table, but should we start there? I don’t agree with that,” Ms. Pelosi said Friday at an event in Medford, Massachusetts. Ms. Pelosi hasn’t held back in her criticism of Mr. Barr, accusing him of committing a crime by lying to Congress about his communications with Mr. Mueller. Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec called Ms. Pelosi’s accusation “reckless, irresponsible and false.” Other members of Ms. Pelosi’s caucus are going after the attorney-general in even stronger terms. “This is serious misconduct, this is a serious effort by the administration to prevent Congress from doing its oversight, and in fact could form the basis by itself of articles of impeachment,” said Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline, a member of the Judiciary panel, after Barr skipped the hearing Thursday. Republicans say the Democrats are focusing on Mr. Barr as a substitute for impeachment, to avoid the political backlash that would come with official proceedings against Mr. Trump. Mr. Nadler “can’t try to pacify his liberal base by pretending to do impeachment without actually taking the plunge,” said Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the Judiciary panel. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., called the strategy “impeachment in drag.” The Barr saga appears destined to end up in court. Mr. Nadler threatened Friday to hold Mr. Barr in contempt if he did not comply with a final request to turn over the Mueller report and the relevant investigative materials. The Justice Department is unlikely to comply, likely prompting a vote of contempt in committee and then the full House. “The committee is prepared to make every realistic effort to reach an accommodation with the department,” Mr. Nadler wrote to Mr. Barr. “But if the department persists in its baseless refusal to comply with a validly issued subpoena, the committee will move to contempt proceedings and seek further legal recourse.” The Justice Department declined to comment on Mr. Nadler’s latest threat of contempt. But White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters that she believes “at no point will it ever be enough” for Democrats. While a contempt vote would send a message, it wouldn’t force the Justice Department to hand over the report. Nor would it guarantee criminal charges against Mr. Barr: House approval of the contempt citation would send a criminal referral to the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, a Justice Department official who is likely to defend the attorney-general. But if the U.S. attorney declines to prosecute, Democrats have other methods to force compliance with witnesses, like hefty fines for witnesses who fail to appear. Even as Democrats struggle with Mr. Barr, they are in hot pursuit of Mr. Mueller’s testimony. Mr. Nadler said the panel was “firming up the date” for Mr. Mueller’s testimony and hoped it would be May 15. Mr. Trump signalled he won’t try to stop it. During a brief Oval Office session with reporters Friday, Mr. Trump deferred to Mr. Barr, saying, “I don’t know. That’s up to the attorney-general, who I think has done a fantastic job.” It’s possible that Mr. Barr could block Mr. Mueller from appearing, since the special counsel is still a Justice Department employee. But Mr. Barr has said he has no objection to Mr. Mueller testifying. On the other side of the Capitol, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, says he doesn’t need Mr. Mueller to testify to his panel. But he is willing to hear Mr. Mueller out on one, narrow matter. On Friday, he offered to let Mr. Mueller provide testimony “if you would like” as to whether he felt Mr. Barr misrepresented Mr. Mueller’s views at the Senate hearing. Mr. Barr testified Wednesday that Mr. Mueller didn’t challenge the accuracy of his memo summarizing the principal conclusions of the special counsel’s report, including when they spoke on the phone. Mr. Barr made that assertion despite a letter he received in March from Mr. Mueller complaining Mr. Barr’s summary didn’t fully capture the “context, nature and substance” of his nearly 400-page report. Mr. Graham invited Mr. Mueller to provide testimony “regarding any misrepresentation by the attorney-general of the substance of that phone call.” He did not specify whether he wanted Mr. Mueller to appear in person.

"10"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-trump-putin-discuss-nuclear-weapons-venezuela-north-korea-and/"|"Deb Riechmann Jill Colvin"|"President Donald Trump and Russia’s Vladimir Putin discussed what Trump again dismissed as the “Russian Hoax” in their first known phone call since the release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Russia’s extensive meddling during the 2016 election campaign. Putin chuckled about Mueller’s conclusions, Trump said. During their conversation on Friday, which the White House and Kremlin said lasted more than an hour, they also discussed a possible three-party arms control pact with China, North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, Ukraine and the crisis in Venezuela, where Moscow is propping up the current government over the U.S.-backed opposition. “We had a good conversation about many things,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. Trump said the two leaders were considering a new nuclear agreement “where we make less and they make less. And maybe even where we get rid of some of the tremendous firepower that we have right now.” He said they had discussed the possibility of including China in the deal and that China would “very much would like to be a part of” it. But more interesting, perhaps, was what was left unsaid. Trump said that, at no point, did he warn Putin not to meddle in the next election. And while he and Putin did discuss Mueller’s findings , they appeared to gloss over Mueller’s description of the extensive efforts Russia took to interfere in the 2016 election, including the 25 Russians indicted for that effort. “We discussed it,” Trump said of the report. “He actually sort of smiled when he said something to the effect that, ‘It started off as a mountain and it ended up being a mouse,“’ Trump said of Putin. “But he knew that because he knew there was no collusion whatsoever. So pretty much that’s what it was.” Trump has repeatedly declined to publicly rebuff Putin for the 2016 operation. And their latest conversation suggests that Mueller’s findings have done little to persuade Trump of the gravity of the threat of foreign election interference or derail his efforts to forge a closer relationship with Putin. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders later said Trump didn’t tell Putin not to meddle in the 2020 election because he’s made that clear in the past. “He doesn’t need to do that every two seconds,” she said. Mueller’s report concluded that Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election was “sweeping and systematic.” Ultimately, Mueller’s investigators did not find a criminal conspiracy between Russia and the Trump campaign, but they found multiple contacts. Indeed, the report concluded that “the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts.” Trump has focused only on Mueller’s top-line conclusions, hailing the lack of evidence of a conspiracy as a political win. Trump tweeted after the call that the two had discussed the “Russian Hoax” among other topics. “As I have always said, long before the Witch Hunt started, getting along with Russia, China, and everyone is a good thing, not a bad thing,” he wrote. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer slammed Trump for failing to press Putin on the report’s “extensive evidence that Russia hacked our elections,” saying: “Trump’s priorities are appalling and undermine democracy.” Trump said he and Putin had instead focused on other topics, including the possibility of the new nuclear arms deal between the U.S., Russia and China. He said U.S. officials had broached the idea with the Chinese during ongoing trade talks and that China was “excited about that, maybe even more excited than about trade.” Discussions on a new nuclear deal, he said, would likely begin shortly between the U.S. and Russia, with China potentially added “down the road.” Trump did not say which arms control agreement he and Putin had discussed, but the Russian state news agency Tass reported that they talked about the New START treaty, the last major arms-control treaty remaining between the U.S. and Russia. The treaty, which was signed in 2010 and expires in 2021, restricts both the U.S. and Russia to 1,550 deployed strategic nuclear warheads on a maximum of 700 deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles and strategic bombers. “There was a discussion about having — extending the current nuclear agreement — as well as discussions about potentially starting a new one that could include China as well,” Sanders said. Trump earlier this year announced that he was pulling the U.S. out of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF, a decades-old nuclear arms treaty with Russia. Trump accused Moscow of violating its terms with “impunity” by deploying missiles banned by the pact. Moscow denies violating it and has accused Washington of being in non-compliance. Trump’s decision to exit the INF treaty reflected his administration’s view that it was an unacceptable obstacle to more forcefully confronting not only Russia but also China. China’s military has grown mightily since that treaty was signed, and the pact had prevented the U.S. from deploying weapons to counter some of those being developed by Beijing. “The world has moved on from the Cold War and its bilateral arms control treaties that cover limited types of nuclear weapons or only certain ranges of adversary missiles,” national security adviser John Bolton told The Associated Press last week. “Russia and China must be brought to the table.” A Kremlin readout of the call said the two presidents confirmed their mutual desire “to intensify dialogue in various fields, including on issues of strategic stability,” but gave no details about a possible arms deal. Trump said the two also spoke extensively about North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un travelled to Russia last week to meet with Putin. Sanders said Trump said several times that it was important for Russia to continue to help put pressure on North Korea to denuclearize. The statement released by the Kremlin after Friday’s call said Putin stressed that “Pyongyang’s conscientious fulfilment of its obligations should be accompanied by reciprocal steps to reduce sanctions pressure on North Korea.” On Venezuela, Trump insisted that Putin “is not looking at all to get involved in Venezuela, other than he’d like to see something positive happen for Venezuela.” That’s despite the fact that Russia has forged a political, military and economic alliance with Venezuela over many years and is helping to support President Nicolas Maduro’s embattled government. The U.S. and about 50 other nations take the position that Maduro’s re-election last year was irrevocably marred by fraud and he is not the legitimate president. In January, the administration took the unusual step of recognizing Juan Guaido, the opposition leader of the National Assembly, as interim president. The Kremlin said that during the call, Putin stressed that only the Venezuelan people have the right to determine the future of their country. The statement said that outside interference in internal affairs and attempts at forceful regime change in Caracas undermine the prospects for a political settlement of the crisis.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo extended the waivers, which were due to expire Saturday, for 90 days, shorter than the 180 days that had been granted in the past. The waivers permit work at several Iranian nuclear sites to continue without U.S. penalties. Under the terms of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, Russia and several European nations help maintain the facilities and are engaged in converting equipment there for exclusively civilian use. Facilities included in the waiver extensions include the Bushehr nuclear power plant, the Fordow enrichment facility, the Arak nuclear complex and the Tehran Research Reactor, the State Department said. However, the Bushehr waiver is being tightened so that any assistance to expand the plant could incur sanctions. The other two waivers – one that allowed Iran to store excess heavy water produced in the uranium enrichment process in Oman, and one that allowed Iran to swap enriched uranium for raw yellowcake with Russia – were not renewed, the department said. That decision is aimed at forcing Iran to stop enriching uranium, something it was allowed to do up to certain limits under the nuclear deal, it said. Highly enriched uranium can be used to fuel a nuclear weapon. “Iran must stop all proliferation-sensitive activities, including uranium enrichment, and we will not accept actions that support the continuation of such enrichment,” State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement. “The United States will continue to impose maximum pressure on the Iranian regime and remains committed to denying Iran any pathway to a nuclear weapon.” President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Iran nuclear deal last year, reimposed sanctions that had been eased in November and has steadily ramped up pressure on Iran in the months since. Last month, his administration announced it would no longer renew sanctions exemptions that allowed China, India, Japan, Turkey and South Korea to continue importing Iranian oil. Those waivers expired Friday, although it was not immediately clear whether the administration would impose sanctions on some or all of those countries if they take delivery of previously purchased oil. Some hardliners on Iran in Congress and outside the administration have called for the elimination of all sanctions waivers, including for civilian nuclear co-operation, in order for the administration to make good on its “maximum pressure” campaign. Supporters of the Iran deal say the co-operation waivers are important to maintain because they give the outside world additional eyes on what Iran is doing in its nuclear facilities.

Health Minister Oly Ilunga told the Associated Press that four deaths in the outbreak’s epicentre of Katwa helped push the death toll to 1,008. Two more deaths were reported in the city of Butembo. The outbreak declared almost nine months ago already had caused the most deaths behind the 2014-16 outbreak in West Africa’s Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia that killed more than 11,000 people. A volatile security situation and deep community mistrust have hampered efforts to control the epidemic in eastern Congo. Ebola treatment centres have come under repeated attack, leaving government health officials to staff clinics in the hot spots of Butembo and Katwa. International aid organizations stopped their work in the two communities because of the violence. A Cameroonian epidemiologist working with the World Health Organization was killed last month during an assault on a hospital in Butembo. Insecurity has become a “major impediment” to controlling the Ebola outbreak, Dr. Michael Ryan, WHO’s health emergencies chief, told reporters in Geneva earlier on Friday. He said 119 attacks have been recorded since January, 42 of them directed at health facilities, while 85 health workers have been wounded or killed. Dozens of rebel groups operate in the region, and political rivalries in part drive’s community rejection of health personnel. “Every time we have managed to regain control over the virus and contain its spread, we have suffered major, major security events,” Dr. Ryan said. “We are anticipating a scenario of continued intense transmission” of the disease. WHO has said the most recent Ebola outbreak remained contained to eastern Congo even as the number of cases rises in a dense, highly mobile population near the border with Uganda and Rwanda. Many people fear going to Ebola treatment centres, choosing instead to stay at home and risk transmitting the disease from the virus to caretakers and neighbours. Residents of highly volatile Butembo believe Ebola was brought to the city on purpose, said Vianney Musavuli, 24. “I am deeply saddened to learn that the number of Ebola deaths has exceeded 1,000,” Mr. Musavuli said “The problem is that people here in this area believe Ebola is a political thing, and that’s why residents are still attacking the teams in retaliation.” Area residents were blocked from taking part in a January presidential election, with Congo’s government citing safety concerns. Some wonder why money is poured into fighting Ebola when many more people die each year of malaria and other preventable diseases. Insecurity also has prevented vaccination teams from getting to some areas, further limiting the health response. Still, more than 109,000 people have received an experimental but effective Ebola vaccine. Dr. Ryan said authorities are looking at introducing another one. He called for more help from Congo and elsewhere to close an “urgent, critical gap” of some US$54-million in containment funding.

"13"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-pope-francis-meets-with-refugees-in-bulgaria-says-they-bear-the/"|"Nicole Winfield Veselin Toshkov"|"Pope Francis told refugees Monday in Bulgaria’s showcase refugee centre that they are bearing the “cross of humanity,” as he pressed his call for the migrant-skeptic Balkan country to welcome poor and desperate foreigners with love. Children from Iraq, Syria and elsewhere sang for Francis and gave him drawings during his visit to the Vrazhdebna refugee centre, located in a school refurbished with EU funds on the outskirts of the Bulgarian capital, Sofia. Francis thanked the children for their joy and hope, and told them that he knows well the pain of leaving behind one’s country. He compared their suffering to the cross Christ bore. “Today, the world of migrants and refugees is a kind of cross, the cross of humanity,” Francis said. “It’s a cross that many people suffer.” Bulgaria’s centre-right government has been criticized by human rights groups and the European Council for its treatment of asylum-seekers, particularly unaccompanied minors. The government, which includes three nationalist, anti-migrant parties, has called for the EU to close its borders to migrants and has sealed off its own border with Turkey with a barbed-wire fence. “He (the Pope) is a great man,” said Taha Saber Ismael, an Iraqi Kurd who was among about 50 refugees who greeted the pope. “I hope he helps us.” Francis is on the second-day of a three-day visit to the Balkans. Upon his arrival Sunday, he urged Bulgarians to not be indifferent to the plight of migrants and refugees, saying many are fleeing war, conflict and abject poverty in search of a better life. He noted that Bulgaria itself was losing thousands of its own citizens who were seeking better opportunities elsewhere in the European Union. Bulgaria is the poorest of the EU’s 28 nations, saddled by widespread corruption. Speaking with Bulgaria’s Catholic community Monday, Francis said refugees are all children of God and deserve love. “Seeing with the eyes of faith is a summons not to spend your life pinning labels, classifying those who are worthy of love and those who are not,” he said. Rather, he urged Bulgaria’s Catholics to “create conditions in which every person can feel loved, especially those who feel forgotten by God because they are forgotten by their brothers and sisters.” The Argentine pope has made the plight of migrants and refugees a hallmark of his papacy, urging governments to build bridges, not walls, and to do what they can to welcome and integrate refugees. His visit falls just three weeks before the European Parliament elections across the EU in which nationalist, anti-migrant parties are expected to make a solid showing. Francis travelled Monday to the Catholic stronghold of Rakovsky for a First Communion Mass and meeting with the local community, who welcomed him warmly on a sun-drenched spring day. Nearly 250 jittery children in white robes filled the pews of the Sacred Heart church, the girls wearing crowns of white roses, before receiving the sacrament for the first time. In his homily, Francis told them that receiving their First Communion was a celebration of communion with the whole church, and he urged them to share that joy with others. Speaking simply, Francis engaged in a Q&A session with the kids, explaining to them the basics of the sacrament and living a Christian life in Italian that was then translated into Bulgarian. Francis usually doesn’t administer Communion during Mass, but did so on Monday for the children. He has implied that he prefers to let others distribute the hosts because he doesn’t want people to use him for opportunistic reasons. Citing local organizers, the Vatican said some 10,000 people were on hand outside the yellow and white church to greet Francis, who arrived into town in his open-sided popemobile. “I haven’t slept all night from excitement,” said Nevenka Tanceva, a Catholic woman from Ravkovsky as she waited for Francis to arrive. “Pope Francis is a good father to us, he unites all Catholics and all people.” Francis wraps up the day with a peace event back in Sofia. On Tuesday, he travels to neighbouring North Macedonia for the first-ever papal visit to the country.

"14"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-china-grappling-with-a-productivity-problem-professor-argues/"|"Nathan VanderKlippe"|"Productivity doesn’t grab public attention when assessing an economy, overshadowed by the gross domestic product numbers that, for a country such as China, have long been the most important criteria for measuring both growth and the performance of the officials in charge. The ability of Chinese leaders and corporate chieftains to wring more productivity out of their economy is fundamental to China’s bid for global economic supremacy and to its desire to improve domestic living standards If it cannot, that vision dims considerably. But what University of Toronto economics professor Loren Brandt has found is that “China’s problem is a productivity problem.” Understanding that productivity stalled has ”huge implications in terms of how you interpret what’s going on today in terms of why this economy is growing at the rate it is, and what is the true underlying reason for it,” Prof. Brandt said in Beijing during a recent visit, as he continues his research on the matter. His research suggests not that there is a problem with the innovation of Chinese companies or the ambition of its entrepreneurs – but that something structural has gone amiss, a problem rooted largely in the persistence of the state in the halls of private industry. Unproductive state-owned companies are a Communist Party legacy and have maintained unexpected strength under President Xi Jinping, who has sought to reinvigorate the party’s role in all aspects of national life. Prof. Brandt, who first came to China three decades ago, has spent many years peering deep into the performance of Chinese companies, using surveys conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics of hundreds of thousands of corporations. He has also worked with colleagues in China to dig into other government records that show in great detail how companies have fared in China over the past decade. He has sought to quantify what scholars call total factor productivity, which is formally defined as the “portion of output not explained by the amount of inputs used in production.” In simple terms, it measures the ability of an economy to create more with the same labour and capital investment, typically by becoming more efficient. Prof. Brandt’s work shows that Chinese productivity rose rapidly until 2007, as the country profited from liberalization measures tied to becoming a member of the World Trade Organization in late 2001. But “our estimates suggest that total productivity growth in industry after 2007 was below zero,” Prof. Brandt wrote in a draft paper for the World Bank, which examined detailed Chinese National Bureau of Statistics data on the individual performance of industrial companies to evaluate productivity from 2007 to 2013. Official statistics in that period still pinned Chinese GDP growth at or near double digits. And there was enough statistical uncertainty that the paper was never formally published. But Prof. Brandt’s subsequent research has only strengthened his conclusion that something has gone deeply amiss in China. Worries about productivity growth have been widespread in Western economies; Chinese leaders have also acknowledged the importance of the measure. China’s 13th five-year plan, the current master blueprint for the expansion of the world’s second-largest economy, promises that China will “see that total factor productivity is markedly improved.” But some problems have continued to persist, particularly the role of state-owned enterprises, or SOEs, which suck up more than a third of Chinese investment but contribute only a single-digit percentage of the country’s economic output. And “SOEs are actually growing, not shrinking,” concluded the Asia Society Policy Institute and the Rhodium Group, two U.S.-based research organizations, in an examination of state-owned enterprise policy reform published earlier this year. Government-controlled steel, nuclear and rail corporations have been merged into goliaths. Dozens of publicly listed Chinese companies sold out to state interests last year alone. The most recent quarterly data show a rise of the state, particularly in key industries, including defence, telecommunications, shipping, energy and electricity. In private companies, too, party governance has become more pronounced. “Ask yourself, after ’07, ’08 – is there any reform we’ve seen that is on par with” the years prior to China joining the WTO, Prof. Brandt asked. “Have we seen any major reform of the service sector? No.” Productivity problems are not limited to individual state-run enterprises alone. As state enterprises receive more attentive political ministrations, they cast a shadow far beyond their own corporate campuses, Prof. Brandt said. You can “find all kinds of examples of where the heavy hand, or the not-so-visible-hand, of the state was potentially costly,” Prof. Brandt said. Conversely, in areas with “the largest reduction in the size of the state sector, that’s where you see the greatest growth of productivity and entry of new firms.” Others have made the same argument. In the book The State Strikes Back, economist Nicholas Lardy describes the stifling of “the competitive forces that had previously powered the Chinese economy, placing more investment in poorly performing and indeed deteriorating state-owned enterprises.” That concept is debated inside China. Zhu Tian, an economist at China Europe International Business School, argues that China’s current slowdown is cyclical, as state planners emphasize anti-graft measures and environmental protection over pure growth. “China is getting richer. And as it gets closer to the technological frontier than it was in the past, technological catch-up is not as fast as it was. So that would contribute to the slowdown in total factor productivity growth,” Prof. Zhu said. China, a major trading country, was also deeply affected by the global slowdown for much of the past decade, adds Wang Yong, a scholar at the Institute of New Structural Economics at Peking University. But Prof. Wang agrees that state companies in China “obtain a lot of investment and crowd out investment to private firms.” “When I write policy recommendations for the government, I always say China’s SOE reform is urgent,” he said. Domination of state companies in sectors like telecommunications are “very detrimental to China’s long-term growth. It has to be changed,” he said. Some economists hope that the U.S.-China trade talks will provide an impetus for Beijing to loosen its grasp on the economy. Prof. Wang says China’s own economic results may also create the case for change. ”When the decision-makers really can see the severe consequences of reform stagnation then I can see hope that this kind of compelled reform could work.” With reporting by Alexandra Li "|"China’s bid for global economic supremacy has hit a stumbling block: productivity"|"2019-05-06T09:50:36-0400"|"china,economy,productivity,data,gdp,growth,trade impact,China,state,problem,reform,investment,slowdown,country,performance",

Cyclone Fani killed at least 34 people in India, destroying houses, ripping off roofs and knocking down electricity poles. Early warnings from meteorologists helped authorities evacuate more than a million people from low-lying towns, minimizing the death toll from the strongest storm in 43 years to pummel India’s east coast. Modi flew by helicopter over battered towns and villages where thousands of rescue workers and volunteers were sifting through the debris. “Before the cyclone, we had released 381 crore (3.81 billion rupees) to Odisha and we will now give an additional 1,000 crore (10 billion rupees) for relief and rebuilding efforts of the state,” Modi said. He also announced financial compensation for victims. Modi said his officials would work closely with the state government to rebuild infrastructure. Chief minister of the state, Naveen Patnaik, has demanded a long-term package worth 170 billion rupees from the central government to build disaster-resistant infrastructure, the state government said. Modi, who is busy campaigning in India’s 39-day staggered general election, last week chaired meetings in New Delhi to oversee efforts to deal with the storm. India’s seven-phase election began on April and voters in Odisha have already cast their ballots. Tens of thousands of people remained without electricity in the state capital Bhubaneswar and the Hindu temple town of Puri after the storm made landfall on Friday. Power has been restored to airports and hospitals. Bhubaneswar airport had resumed flights, state government officials said. In a letter addressed to Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism, pledged 1 million rupees ($14,400) to Odisha. After battering India, Fani barrelled into neighbouring Bangladesh on Saturday as a much weaker storm, killing at least five people. By Monday, more than a million Bangladeshis had returned to their homes from cyclone shelters, officials said.

The baby weighed 7 pounds, 3 ounces and was born at 5:26 a.m. Harry said their son was a little bit overdue and that had given the royal couple more time to contemplate names. The Duke of Sussex said he was ecstatic about the birth of their first child and promised that more details – such as the baby’s name – will be shared in the coming days. The couple said earlier they weren’t going to find out the baby’s sex in advance. “This little thing is absolutely to die for,” Harry said. “I’m just over the moon.” Opinion: Stop judging Meghan Markle (or any other woman’s) birthing choices With both boys and a girl, royal parents join others in deciding how to raise their different gender children Harry and the palace didn’t immediately provide details on whether the baby was born at a hospital or if it was a home birth. The royal couple had earlier said they wanted to keep details private. The infant is seventh in line to the British throne and is the Queen’s eighth great-grandchild. Harry is the younger son of Prince Charles, heir to the throne, and the late Diana, Princess of Wales, who died in a Paris car crash in 1997. The 34-year-old Harry, speaking before TV cameras on Monday afternoon in Windsor, said he was present for the birth. “It’s been the most amazing experience I could ever have possibly imagined,” he said. “How any woman does what they do is beyond comprehension." “We’re both absolutely thrilled and so grateful for all the love and support from everybody out there. It’s been amazing, so we just wanted to share this with everybody,” he gushed. Meghan’s mother, Doria Ragland, was reportedly also with her daughter and said she is overjoyed, according to British media. Senior royals were informed of the birth, as was the family of Diana, before Harry went before the cameras. The couple’s Instagram account said: “It’s a boy! Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are overjoyed to announce the birth of their child.” Harry said he planned to make another announcement, likely in two days, “so everyone can see the baby.” It’s expected they will pose for a family picture at that point. Crowds that had gathered in Windsor near the castle, one of the Queen’s favourite residences, reacted with joy to the news. Some said it would provide a welcome respite from the continuing political stalemate over Brexit. British Prime Minister Theresa May congratulated the royal couple and wished them the best in a tweet. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau posted on Twitter this afternoon that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex should “Enjoy every minute of this happy time together as a new family of three.” Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer also sent best wishes to the new parents, wishing them “all the best on the birth of their baby boy.” Canadian actor Patrick J. Adams tweeted well wishes to his former Suits co-star, Meghan. The Toronto native posted on Twitter: “Just heard that the world just got heavier by seven pounds and three ounces. Much love to him and his incredible parents.” Mr. Adams added he “couldn’t be happier for Meghan and Harry as they begin this adventure.” He concluded the tweet with the hashtag “#playdatesoon.” The former Meghan Markle was an American TV star before retiring from acting to marry Harry at St. George’s Chapel on the grounds of Windsor Castle a year ago. The child will be eligible for dual British-U.S. citizenship if Meghan and Harry want to go through the application process. The birth of Britain’s latest royal baby marks the completion of Harry’s transformation from a boy whose mother died when he was just 12 to a sometimes-troubled teen, a committed military man, a popular senior royal, a husband and now a proud father. He has long spoken of his desire to start a family. He and his older brother, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, along with their wives, are seen by many in Britain as the new, fresh faces of a Royal Family that had become stodgy and aged. They are raising the next generation of royals amid a genuine groundswell of British public support for the monarchy. Meghan, in particular, represents a change for the royals. At 37, she is older than Harry, had a previous marriage that ended in divorce and has strong feminist views. As the daughter of a black mother and a white father, she identifies as biracial. Meghan also achieved considerable success in her own right before agreeing to a blind date with Harry that changed both of their lives. She had an important role in Suits, pressed for increased women’s rights around the world and had a wide following even before she joined the world’s most famous Royal Family. Harry and Meghan recently moved from central London to a secluded house known as Frogmore Cottage near Windsor Castle, about 40 kilometres west of London. The move is seen in part as reflecting a desire for privacy as they raise their first child. It also separates Harry and Meghan from William and his wife, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, who had been living in the same compound at Kensington Palace in central London with their three children – Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis – the new baby’s cousins.

The AK Party representative on the board, Recep Ozel, said the decision was based on unsigned results documents from the March 31 election and on some ballot box officials not being civil servants. Turkey’s main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP), which narrowly won the mayor’s office in the country’s largest city, called the ruling a “plain dictatorship.” Kati Piri, the European Parliament’s Turkey rapporteur, said the decision “ends the credibility of democratic transition of power through elections” in the country. Reuters witnesses said people were banging on pots and pans in protest against the ruling in several Istanbul districts. The AKP had appealed for an election rerun after initial results and a series of recounts showed it had lost control of Istanbul for the first time in 25 years. It was a shock loss for Mr. Erdogan, who in the 1990s served as the city’s mayor and had campaigned hard ahead of the nationwide local vote, his first electoral test since last year’s sharp currency crisis tipped the Turkish economy into recession. The Turkish lira weakened and was at 6.1075 against the US dollar at 1730 GMT, on track for its worst day in more than a month. The currency has tumbled more than 10 per cent since a week before the initial election. Suspense over the ruling had left investors worried that weeks of additional campaigning would divert funds and attention from addressing economic reforms. “This is damaging for Turkey’s perception as a democracy and will leave Turkey’s economy vulnerable, given risks to macro financial stability in the period to July,” said Timothy Ash of BlueBay Asset Management. Inflation near 20 per cent and unemployment near 15 per cent drove many voters to abandon the AKP in the initial vote. Before the second vote, tensions with the United States could escalate over Turkey’s planned purchase of a Russian S-400 missile defence system, which could trigger U.S. sanctions. It was unclear how the CHP and its supporters would respond to a rerun given suspicions over the Supreme Electoral Council’s, or YSK, political independence from the AKP, which in recent years has centralized power in the presidency away from other institutions. One CHP member of parliament, Mehmet Bekaroglu, said on Arti TV that the AKP pressed and threatened YSK judges with prison if they voted against a rerun. Ms. Piri also said pressure was applied to redo the elections. “It is illegal to win against the AK Party,” CHP deputy chairman Onursal Adiguzel said on Twitter. “This system that overrules the will of the people and disregards the law is neither democratic, nor legitimate.” In the capital Ankara – where the AKP also lost the mayor’s office to the CHP – police blocked the entrance to the YSK’s headquarters on Monday evening. The YSK also ruled to file a criminal complaint against those district election board officials who had appointed the ballot box officials. With its nationalist MHP allies, the AKP wanted the Istanbul results annulled and cited irregularities that affected the outcome, which put it some 13,000 votes behind CHP. On Saturday, Mr. Erdogan said “it’s clear” the vote was marred by controversy and urged the YSK to “clear its name” with a rerun. Ekrem Imamoglu, the CHP mayor who officially took office after a smattering of recounts were completed across Istanbul last month, condemned the YSK for annulling the results under AKP pressure. “Shame on the YSK. They were placed under political pressure from day one,” Mr. Imamoglu told hundreds of chanting and flag-waving supporters. Turkey held a rerun of general elections in 2015 when the AK Party failed for the first time since its founding to form a single-party government. In a repeat election, AK Party found the support to form it again. In recent weeks city prosecutors began probes into alleged irregularities and called 100 polling station workers in for questioning as suspects.

The judgments overruled a decision by Spain’s Electoral Board, which had said it would prohibit the three from running in the May 26 race to fill the country’s allotted seats at the parliament in Strasbourg. Three separate courts in Madrid ruled in favour of appeals filed by Mr. Puigdemont and his two associates, who argued that their democratic rights were being violated. All three separatists fled Spain to avoid arrest for participating in Catalonia’s failed secession attempt in 2017. Mr. Puigdemont and Antoni Comin reside in Belgium, and Clara Ponsati in Britain. It appears that, even if elected, they wouldn’t be able to take their seats since that would require them to first go back to Spain to receive their official parliamentary credentials in person. They are still wanted in Spain and would face arrest. A dozen other separatist leaders who stayed in Spain are currently undergoing trial at the supreme court in Madrid.

"20"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-reuters-reporters-jailed-in-myanmar-freed-from-prison/"|"Simon Lewis and Shoon Naing"|"Two Reuters journalists jailed in Myanmar after they were convicted of breaking the Official Secrets Act walked free from prison on Tuesday after more than 500 days behind bars. Wa Lone, 33, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 29, had been convicted in September and sentenced to seven years in jail in a case that raised questions about Myanmar’s progress towards democracy and sparked an outcry from diplomats and human rights advocates. They were released under a presidential amnesty for 6,520 prisoners. President Win Myint has pardoned thousands of other prisoners in mass amnesties since last month. It is customary in Myanmar for authorities to free prisoners across the country around the time of the traditional New Year, which began on April 17. Reuters has said the two men did not commit any crime and had called for their release. Swamped by media and well-wishers as they walked through the gates of Insein Prison, on the outskirts of Yangon, a grinning Wa Lone gave a thumbs up and said he was grateful for the international efforts to secure their freedom. “I’m really happy and excited to see my family and my colleagues. I can’t wait to go to my newsroom,” he said. Kyaw Soe Oo smiled and waved to reporters. The two were then driven away by Reuters colleagues and reunited with their wives and children. Before their arrest in December 2017, they had been working on an investigation into the killing of 10 Rohingya Muslim men and boys by security forces and Buddhist civilians in western Myanmar’s Rakhine State during an army crackdown that began in August 2017. The operation sent more than 730,000 Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh, according to U.N. estimates. The report the two men authored, featuring testimony from perpetrators, witnesses and families of the victims, was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for international reporting in May, adding to a number of accolades received by the pair for their journalism. Government spokesman Zaw Htay said the decision to release the two was made after the families wrote to government leader Aung San Suu Kyi. “We took the letters into consideration and released them in the interest of the country,” Zaw Htay told reporters. Reuters Editor-in-Chief Stephen J. Adler welcomed the news. “We are enormously pleased that Myanmar has released our courageous reporters, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo. Since their arrests 511 days ago, they have become symbols of the importance of press freedom around the world. We welcome their return,” Adler said. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was relieved to learn of the release, a spokesman said. The United Nations in Myanmar said it saw the release as a sign of the government’s commitment to the transition to democracy. The U.S. Embassy also welcomed the release and said it was glad the two could return to their families. Myanmar’s Supreme Court had rejected the journalists’ final appeal in April. They had petitioned the top court, citing evidence of a police set-up and lack of proof of a crime, after the Yangon High Court dismissed an earlier appeal in January. The reporters’ wives wrote a letter to the government in April pleading for a pardon, not, they said, because their husbands had done anything wrong, but because it would allow them to be released from prison and reunited with their families. The Reuters journalists were released at the prison to representatives of Reuters and to Lord Ara Darzi, a British surgeon and health care expert who has served as a member of an advisory group to Myanmar’s government on reforms in Rakhine State. “This outcome shows that dialogue works, even in the most difficult of circumstances,” Darzi said in a statement. Darzi said discussions about the pardon for Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo had involved the Myanmar government, Reuters, the United Nations and representatives of other governments. He said the government, led by Nobel laureate Suu Kyi, could only consider releasing the pair after the Supreme Court had rejected their final appeal. “I’m very grateful to the president, the state counsellor (Suu Kyi) and also the cabinet, for making that happen.” Darzi has been a member of an advisory commission that was formed in 2016 to see through the advice from a panel headed by former U.N. chief Kofi Annan on solving the long-running conflict in Rakhine.

"21"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-post-apartheid-south-africa-is-worlds-most-unequal-country-world/"|"Cara Anna"|"Perhaps nowhere in today’s South Africa is the country’s inequality on more dramatic display than in the neighbouring Johannesburg suburbs of Sandton and Alexandra. With its gleaming highrises and lush estates, Sandton is known as Africa’s richest square mile. Alexandra, a one-time home to Nelson Mandela, is a squalid, cramped and crime-infested black township. Many of its residents stream into Sandton every day on a bridge over a highway to work in upscale shops or homes. Angry protests flared in Alexandra last month, stoked in part by campaigning for Wednesday’s national election but mostly by the frustration that South Africa should look far different than the country of haves and have-nots that it has become. Many voters believe the ruling African National Congress has lost its way since Mandela won the first post-apartheid presidential election in 1994, and that belief threatens the ANC’s absolute majority grip on power. The ANC has been shaken by widespread allegations of corruption that saw former President Jacob Zuma forced out a year ago, and many South Africans feel the party can no longer coast on its legacy of fighting the brutal system of apartheid. Unemployment in the country of 56 million people soars past 25 per cent. There are tire-burning protests almost every day over the lack of basic services like working toilets in mostly black neighbourhoods. Whites still hold much of the wealth and private levers of power, while blacks trim their lawns and clean their homes. “We find virtually no whites living below the middle class,” Fazila Farouk and Murray Leibbrandt with the Southern Africa Labor and Development Research Unit wrote last year. “Whites have, in fact, comfortably improved their economic status in post-apartheid South Africa because our economy channels such a big share of national income to the top 10 per cent.” Half of South Africans are in households with per capita income of 1,149 rand ($90) or less a month, they wrote, with little chance to change their fortunes despite working hard as maids or security guards. “Put bluntly, they’re stuck,” Farouk and Leibbrandt concluded. Thembeni Manana, an activist who works with the Greater Alexandra Chamber of Commerce, knows the feeling well, describing the inequality that residents of Alexandra feel when then cross the highway bridge into upscale Sandton. “The air in Sandton is so fresh, you could swear they have air-cons outside,” Manana said, referring to the air-conditioned highrises in the wealthy enclave. “When you come back to Alex, yo! A most disgusting smell! A sewer that’s overflowing, rats all over the road.” The 28-year-old helped co-ordinate last month’s protests, saying that the challenges in righting the inequality are more than cosmetic, more than huddling through power outages in Alexandra while the Sandton skyline glows, unaffected. “With us, we decided enough is enough. We want to challenge the system,” she added. She delivered a rapid-fire list of demands: Schools in Alexandra should have a ratio of 30 children per teacher instead of 70. Street vendors should be allowed to supply grocery store chains, giving them access to the wider economy. Children should be able grow up with both parents in homes that have more than one room, allowing for privacy. The World Bank says South Africa is the most unequal nation on the planet, a fact that former President F.W. de Klerk, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, called “the deepest national shame.” It’s cutting criticism by someone who oversaw the end of a system that chilled much of the world by segregating its people by the colour of their skin. Current President Cyril Ramaphosa, a Mandela protege, doesn’t shy away from the critique. “Ours is still a deeply unequal country,” he acknowledged last month in marking 25 years since the end of apartheid. South Africa’s “disturbing” wealth inequality is even more striking than its income disparity, and it threatens democratic values, according to a committee that explored the idea of a wealth tax. Such a tax might help but likely would not change the social relations that create inequality, said Aroop Chatterjee of the Southern Center for Inequality Studies at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. As Ramaphosa wages war on corruption within an ANC divided into the allies of Zuma, the former president, and those who want reform, public exasperation grows and populist movements simmer. Grievances like those cited by Manana are not limited to Alexandra but exist in many of South Africa’s black townships, and Wednesday’s election likely will reflect the weariness of asking again and again for change. While South Africa was famous for its long lines of voters in the first post-apartheid election 25 years ago, the sense of national apathy is an ominous sign for the ANC. “I think people are just tired of voting,” Manana said. “They realize the character of the political parties, only out to play during election time,” and then disappear until the next balloting five years later, she said.

With Arctic temperatures rising at twice the rate of the rest of the globe, the melting ice is creating potential new shipping lanes and has opened much of the world’s last untapped reserves of oil and gas to commercial exploitation. A meeting of eight nations bordering the Arctic in Rovaniemi in Finland on Tuesday was supposed to frame a two-year agenda to balance the challenge of global warming with sustainable development of mineral wealth. But sources with knowledge of the discussions said the United States balked at signing a final declaration as it disagreed with wording that climate change was a serious threat to the Arctic. It was the first time a declaration had been cancelled since the Arctic Council was formed in 1996. Instead, in a brief statement, ministers from the United States, Canada, Russia, Finland, Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Iceland repeated their commitment to sustainable development and the protection of the Arctic environment. Except for the United States, other nations had wanted to go further, participants said. “A majority of us regarded climate change as a fundamental challenge facing the Arctic and acknowledged the urgent need to take mitigation and adaptation actions and to strengthen resilience,” talks chair and Finnish Foreign Minister Timo Soini said in a statement. “I don’t want to name and blame anyone,” he told reporters. A senior U.S. State Department official denied Washington had again dragged its heels over global environmental action. “There were several different versions of the declaration going around. The U.S. was ready to sign,” said the official, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity. The idea for “a simpler, positive, unified, collective message” had come from Russia and Canada, he added. Scientists believe the Arctic contains around 13 per cent of the world’s undiscovered reserves of oil and 30 per cent of its reserves of natural gas as well as huge deposits of minerals such as zinc, iron and rare earth metals. Harvesting them remains expensive, but melting ice is making that more feasible, as well as affecting the world’s weather, and the Arctic’s wildlife and indigenous residents. Addressing the Council, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said President Donald Trump’s administration “shares your deep commitment to environmental stewardship” in the Arctic. But he said collective goals were not always the answer. Agreements between countries in the Arctic Council are non-binding, and Pompeo accused Russia and China of not playing by the rules as they look to assert rights over resources and trade routes. “Collective goals … are rendered meaningless, even counterproductive as soon as one nation fails to comply,” Pompeo told the Council. President Trump has frequently expressed skepticism about whether global warming is a result of human activity and has stood by his 2017 decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord signed by almost 200 governments in 2015. That has put him at odds with campaigners and many other countries. “A climate crisis in the Arctic is not a future scenario, it is happening as we speak,” Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom said in her address to the Council. The Paris accord agreed to limit a rise in average global temperatures to “well below” 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial times by 2100. Worldwide, temperatures are up about 1C (1.8F).

"23"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-pope-francis-makes-historic-first-visit-to-north-macedonia/"|"Konstantin Testorides Nicole Winfield"|"Pope Francis made the first-ever papal visit to North Macedonia on Tuesday and sought to encourage its efforts to integrate into European institutions after its name change resolved a decades-long dispute with Greece. In a meeting with government authorities, Francis praised North Macedonia’s multi-ethnic and multi-faith culture and said its example of being a bridge between East and West showed that peaceful co-existence can exist in a country rich with diversity. “These particular features are also highly significant for increased integration with the nations of Europe,” he said. “It is my hope that this integration will develop in a way that is beneficial for the entire region of the Western Balkans, with unfailing respect for diversity and for fundamental rights.” North Macedonia’s previous constitutional name was the Republic of Macedonia. It officially changed its name to North Macedonia in February as part of an agreement to end an almost three-decade long dispute with Greece, which blocked the former Yugoslav republic’s path to membership in NATO and the EU over rights to the Macedonia name. After landing at Skopje’s airport, Francis went by car – a typically small Volkswagen Jetta – for talks with outgoing President Gjore Ivanov. His 10-hour visit also included a prayer at the memorial of North Macedonia’s most famous native daughter, Mother Teresa, as well as a Mass for the tiny Catholic community in the country of 2.1 million. Francis was surrounded by Mother Teresa’s sari-clad Sisters of Charity nuns in praying before the memorial, a giant statue of the tiny nun, located outside the remains of the church where Anjeze Gonxhe Bojaxhiu was baptized in 1910. In his homily at Mass, Francis praised Mother Teresa’s dedication to the poor, saying it quenched her hunger for God. “She went to the Lord exactly as she went to the despised, the unloved, the lonely and the forgotten,” Francis said to a crowd in a central Skopje square that organizers estimated at 15,000 gathered. Viktor Dimovski, North Macedonia’s foreign ministry state secretary, told reporters Monday that Francis’ visit was historic and comes at a crucial moment as North Macedonia seeks entry into the European Union and NATO. “The pope’s visit strengthens further internal cohesion and unity, and brings messages of reconciliation and solidarity,” he said. The country has been an EU candidate since 2005, but is still waiting for the start of membership talks with the bloc. With the name dispute now resolved, North Macedonia hopes to get a clear signal for the start of accession talks in June. It expects to become the 30th NATO member at the end of this year. But the country is deeply polarized between the governing Social Democrats, who support the name deal, and the opposition VMRO-DPMNE conservatives, fierce opponents of the name change. Ivanov, the outgoing president, referred to the divisions in his speech to the pope, urging Macedonians to use the visit as an opportunity to heal after being “heavily wounded by broken promises, unfulfilled expectations and faltering trust in the international community.” “Only spiritually transformed people can transform the spirit of society,” Ivanov said. Pro-EU President Stevo Pendarovski, who was elected president in a runoff election last weekend, said he saw his victory as a “ticket for NATO and EU.” While the visit was a political boost for North Macedonia, it was also a spiritual boost for Catholics from across the region and ethnic spectrum. “It is magnificent that we came to see the pope here in Macedonia because he has a message for the youth and whole humanity, and we need to apply it in our lives,” said Kristiana Mjeshtri, a Catholic from Albania. Ivan Giljanovic travelled from Split, Croatia. “I am a Catholic and it means a lot for me,” he said. “Everything is about faith.” "|"Pope Francis makes historic first visit to North Macedonia "|"2019-05-07T09:28:47-0400"|"Pope Francis,North Macedonia,Greece,NATO,Vatican,Catholic Church,papal visit,news,world,macedonia,name,francis,visit,integration,country", 
"24"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-us-warns-china-russia-against-aggression-in-the-arctic-region/"|"Mike Blanchfield"|"Canada’s claim over the Northwest Passage is “illegitimate,” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Monday in a major speech to the Arctic Council that Canadian experts called both provocative and frequently inaccurate. Mr. Pompeo offered his characterization during a wide-ranging speech in Finland in which he also warned against China’s increased Arctic presence, saying it threatens North American security and could be harmful to the environment. Mr. Pompeo reiterated long-held concerns about Russia’s military buildup in the Arctic and how that, too, is viewed as being counter to U.S. security interests. “No one denies Russia has significant Arctic interests,” Mr. Pompeo said in a transcript of remarks circulated by the U.S. State Department. “We recognize that Russia is not the only nation making illegitimate claims. The U.S. has a long-contested feud with Canada over sovereign claims through the Northwest Passage.” Mr. Pompeo’s branding of a long-time disagreement on Arctic policy between the Canada and the United States is a “stunning rebuke” of the 1988 Arctic Co-operation agreement between the two countries, said Fen Hampson, the head of the international-security program at the Centre for International Governance Innovation in Waterloo, Ont. “It underscores the ‘upset-every-applecart’ approach by the Trump administration to Canada-U. S. relations,” said Hampson, the author of a recent book on the foreign policy of former prime minister Brian Mulroney. The routes between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans run between Canadian islands but the two countries disagree about whether that makes them internal Canadian waters or international waters that have Canadian territory nearby. The disagreement matters more now that melting Arctic sea ice means the Northwest Passage is getting closer to being a viable commercial shipping route. The agreement reached by Mulroney and then-president Ronald Reagan allows the U.S. to designate the Northwest Passage as an international waterway while allowing Canada to say that it is a part of Canadian sovereign territory. The treaty recognizes the “close and friendly relations between their two countries, the uniqueness of ice-covered maritime areas, the opportunity to increase their knowledge of the marine environment of the Arctic through research conducted during icebreaker voyages, and their shared interest in safe, effective icebreaker navigation off their Arctic coasts.” The Canadian government pointed to that agreement in responding to Pompeo’s speech. “Canada and the U.S. have differing views regarding the status of the Northwest Passage under international law,” said Guillaume Berube, a spokesman for the Department of Foreign Affairs. “The situation is well managed, including through the 1988 Arctic Co-operation Agreement, according to which the U.S. government seeks Canada’s consent for its icebreakers to navigate the waterways. Canada remains committed to exercising the full extent of its rights and sovereignty over its territory and its Arctic waters, including the various waterways commonly referred to as the Northwest Passage. Those waterways are part of the internal waters of Canada.” Hampson said the treaty was a “neighbourly understanding to agree to disagree about Canada’s territorial claims over the Northwest Passage, whereby the U.S. would seek Canada’s permission about transit through these straits.” There is little that Canada can do if the U.S. sends a ship through the passage without prior notification, he said. “We can remind them, though, that if they are worried about a growing Chinese and Russian presence in the North and aspirations to create a circumpolar Silk Road, they might want to work more closely with their NORAD partner and refrain from challenging our sovereignty,” said Hampson. “This isn’t the time to be throwing snowballs.” Michael Byers, an Arctic expert at the University of British Columbia, said Pompeo’s characterization of the Canadian position as illegitimate is actually factually correct, but it is “the only accurate and rational statement in the speech.” The federal government should be worried that the top diplomat from one of its key Arctic allies got his facts so wrong, Byers said. One of the most glaring of several mistakes, said Byers, is Pompeo’s assertion that China is trying to build infrastructure in the Canadian Far North. China is “planning to build infrastructure from Canada, to the Northwest Territories, to Siberia,” Pompeo said. “This is part of a very familiar pattern. Beijing attempts to develop critical infrastructure using Chinese money, Chinese companies, and Chinese workers – in some cases, to establish a permanent Chinese security presence.” China’s signature international infrastructure project, the multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative, aims to expand trade by building roads, ports and other facilities to connect Asia through Africa and the Middle East to Europe. The U.S. opposes what it sees as an aggressive push by China to assert its influence by lending money to less developed countries and creating what is known as a “debt trap.” A Chinese state-owned company ended up in possession of a port in Sri Lanka when that country couldn’t pay off loans, for instance. “I have not heard of any Chinese plans to build infrastructure in the Canadian Arctic,” said Byers. “There’s no factual basis, certainly not in the public domain, and that would also require the full involvement of the Canadian government. It’s just flat-out wrong.” (Byers did note that northern Quebec has a Chinese-owned lithium mine.) A senior government official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation, said Pompeo did not appear to refer to specific Chinese projects in Canada related to the Belt and Road Initiative and may have been speculating. The official added: “There are no investments here, nor are there any contemplated.” Berube, the spokesman for the Foreign Affairs Department, said Canada “welcomes continued discussions with China on Arctic issues,” which the two countries can have through existing two-way and multinational mechanisms.

"25"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-runaway-saudi-sisters-leaving-georgia-as-they-prepare-to-start-new/"|"Umberto Bacchi"|"Two runaway Saudi sisters who won global attention for fleeing to Georgia and pleading online for protection said on Tuesday they were preparing to start new lives in a country where their family could not find them. Maha, 28, and Wafa al-Subaie, 25, started an online campaign to find a safe haven in April after arriving in Georgia to escape relatives they said abused them, in the latest case to highlight Saudi Arabia’s strict social control over women. “We are thrilled to announce that we are leaving Georgia,” the young women wrote on Tuesday from their Twitter account @GeorgiasSisters2, posting a short video of them at the airport. The sisters applied for asylum in Georgia in April, but said they feared their family could come to the former Soviet republic, which does not require visas, and force them back. Georgia’s interior ministry said the sisters decided to travel to another country while their asylum application was pending. “Any asylum seeker is free to travel upon his/her decision and willingness,” a ministry spokeswoman told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an e-mail. The sisters tweeted earlier that they wanted their destination to remain secret “for a little while” and thanked all those had who supported them. “As we settle in our new home and life we will continue to support Saudi women. We will continue our fight against guardian abuse. Many Saudi women supported us and we will never forget it,” they wrote. The United Nations refugee agency in Georgia, which had been following their application process, said it would not comment on individual cases. Saudi women must have permission from a male relative to work, marry and travel under the Islamic kingdom’s guardianship system, which human rights groups say can trap women and girls in abusive families. The sisters are the third group of young Saudi women this year to attract global attention for seeking refuge outside their homeland. A teenage girl won asylum in Canada when she holed up in a Thai airport hotel in January to escape her family. Two other Saudi sisters who hid in Hong Kong for six months were granted visas in March to travel to a third country. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has introduced reforms, such as lifting a ban on women driving, and indicated last year that he favoured ending the guardianship system. But he has stopped short of backing its annulment. Suad Abu-Dayyeh, Middle East consultant for women’s rights group Equality Now, said it was good the sisters had finally found a country where they could live freely. But she warned more would follow unless Saudi Arabia changed. “As long as Saudi Arabia’s male guardianship system remains in place, there will continue to be women and girls who take huge risks to flee a country that denies them basic human rights and freedoms,” she said.

Cyclone Kenneth crashed into the province of Cabo Delgado on April 25, flattening entire villages and killing more than 40 people. More than 200,000 people are estimated to be affected. Reported cases of cholera in the province have risen almost five-fold to 64 since the outbreak was officially declared on May 2, according to the United Nations. Aid agency Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said it was providing tents, water and sanitation equipment for a cholera treatment centre in the port city of Pemba, which was badly hit by the storm. “We have two essential goals now: saving the lives of severely sick patients and containing the outbreak,” said Danielle Borges, MSF project coordinator in Pemba. “We need to isolate and treat sick people so they recover, and so that they do not contaminate others. We need to make sure that people stop using infected water, and we should do all we can to prevent people from getting sick.” Cholera is an extremely virulent disease that causes severe acute watery diarrhoea due to the ingestion of contaminated food or water, says the World Health Organization. It can take five days for symptoms to show and can lead to death if untreated. Kenneth struck while Mozambique was still struggling to deal with the impact of Cyclone Idai, which hammered the country’s central region just six weeks earlier. Idai destroyed the port city of Beira and caused devastating floods and leaving health officials and international aid agencies battling cholera. The cyclone killed more 1,000 people across Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe. It was the first time on record that two powerful storms had hit the southern African country in such a short space of time. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said at least 19 health facilities were hit by the cyclone and water and sanitation facilities damaged, heightening the risk of water-borne disease. “From our previous experience responding to Cyclone Idai which struck Mozambique in March 2019, we anticipated such a situation to happen,” said Daw Mohamed, Humanitarian Director for CARE International. “We have already mobilised hygiene kits and sanitation supplies, which will be in the affected districts imminently. However, the needs remain more than we can handle so massive support is required in funds, expertise and resources.” "|"Aid workers race to contain cholera outbreak in cyclone-hit Mozambique "|"2019-05-07T13:17:26-0400"|"Mozambique,cholera,UN,Cabo Delgado,Cyclone Kenneth,Cyclone Idai,MSF,news,world,people,mozambique,water,cyclone,time,outbreak", 
"27"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-us-iran-tensions-rise-ahead-of-anniversary-of-trumps-decision-to/"|"Nasser Karimi Jon Gambrell"|"Iran on Wednesday will announce it is partially withdrawing from the nuclear deal it struck with world powers, its state-run news agency reported, a year to the day that President Donald Trump pulled America from the accord. The terms of the withdrawal remain unclear, though the IRNA news agency said President Hassan Rouhani will explain Iran’s decision in letters to leaders of Britain, France and Germany that will be handed to ambassadors in Tehran. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif separately will write to the European Union, the agency said. The semi-official ISNA news agency reported late Tuesday that Zarif had left for Moscow to meet with Russian leader Vladimir Putin to discuss bilateral and international issues, without elaborating. Details of the letters, all to signers of the 2015 accord, will not be publicly disclosed, it said. The letters will come as officials in the Islamic Republic previously warned that Iran might increase its uranium enrichment, potentially pulling away from a deal it has sought to salvage for months. Already, the White House has announced the deployment of a U.S. aircraft carrier and a bomber wing to the Persian Gulf over unspecified threats from Iran. The United Nations’ nuclear watchdog says Iran has continued to comply with the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal, which saw it limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. But American sanctions have wreaked havoc on Iran’s already-anemic economy, while promised help from European partners in the deal haven’t alleviated the pain. The U.S. last week stopped issuing waivers for countries importing Iranian crude oil, a crucial source of cash for Iran’s government. It also halted waivers allowing Iran to store excess heavy water in Oman and to swap enriched uranium for raw yellowcake with Russia. Trump campaigned on a promise to tear up the deal struck by his predecessor, Barack Obama. While Trump has sought to dismantle much of Obama’s policies, he particularly criticized the Iran nuclear deal for failing to address Tehran’s ballistic missile program and what he described as its malign influence across the rest of the Mideast. A statement Sunday night from U.S. national security adviser John Bolton said the USS Abraham Lincoln, other ships in the carrier’s strike group and a bomber wing would deploy to the Mideast. Bolton blamed “a number of troubling and escalatory indications and warnings,” without elaborating. “The United States is not seeking war with the Iranian regime, but we are fully prepared to respond to any attack, whether by proxy, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or regular Iranian forces,” Bolton said. A spokesman for Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, Keivan Khosravi, dismissed Bolton’s comments as “psychological warfare.” Iran’s hard-line Javan newspaper, associated with the Revolutionary Guard, said Wednesday would “ignite the matchstick for burning the deal.” It suggested in its Tuesday edition that Iran may install advanced centrifuges at its Natanz facility and begin enrichment at its Fordo facility, activities prohibited under the nuclear deal. The USS Abraham Lincoln had been in the Mediterranean Sea conducting operations alongside the USS John C. Stennis, another aircraft carrier that has twice been in the Persian Gulf in recent months. On Tuesday, U.S. military officials said the Lincoln would be skipping a planned port call in Croatia to more rapidly reach the Persian Gulf. However, American military officials have stopped the near-continuous presence of aircraft carriers in the Persian Gulf, a pattern set following the 1991 Gulf War. American air bases spanning the region can scramble fighter jets and drones, lessening the necessity of an aircraft carrier as U.S. officials also worry about China and Russia. Already in the Persian Gulf is a group of U.S. Navy warships led by the USS Kearsarge, an amphibious assault ship carrying troops from the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit. The Kearsarge also carries AV-8B Harrier fighter jets, MH-60 helicopters and MV-22 Osprey airplanes. Across the wider 5th Fleet, there were 17 warships deployed, according to the most-recent count by the U.S. Naval Institute, which tracks deployments around the world. The Bahrain-based 5th Fleet declined to comment on the White House announcement when reached by the AP on Monday. It also remains unclear where the bomber wing would be deployed to the region. Typically, the al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar, home to the forward headquarters of the U.S. military’s Central Command, hosts such bomber deployments. In late March, the Air Force acknowledged a rare gap in bomber cover in the Mideast after a squadron of B-1 Lancers left al-Udeid to return to Texas. B-52 bombers also had been deployed to the area to keep up attacks on the Islamic State group, the first time the aging aircraft had deployed to the region in 25 years. Officials at al-Udeid, which also hosts the F-35 fighter jet, declined to answer questions from the AP. However, a statement Tuesday from Central Command said the Air Force again planned to deploy B-52s to the region. The Trump administration, which abruptly announced in December that it was pulling out of Syria, still maintains 2,000 U.S. troops in the northern part of the war-torn country. Officials suggest they serve as a check on Iranian ambitions and help ensure that Islamic State fighters do not regroup. No significant U.S. forces have so far withdrawn from Syria. Trump has also said he has no plans to withdraw the 5,200 troops stationed in Iraq as part of a security agreement to advise, assist and support the country’s troops in the fight against IS. Earlier this year, Trump angered Iraqi politicians and Iranian-backed factions by saying troops should stay there to keep an eye on neighbouring Iran.

Authorities weren’t certain of what the hostage taker was demanding. No injuries were reported. The youth seized the hostages at 4:20 p.m. (1420 GMT) in the town of Blagnac, near Toulouse airport, according to a national police spokeswoman. The suspect was not known to police, the spokeswoman said, declining to divulge details of his identity while the standoff was still under way. The teen later released all four hostages but remained inside the store, surrounded by police, another police official said. Local state television France 3 reported that the hostage-taker fired three shots in the air, is wearing a helmet fitted with a camera and demanded to speak with a negotiator. Police locked down the neighbourhood, evacuating some buildings and ordering other residents to stay inside, according to neighbour Robert Texier. A police helicopter circled overhead. The police spokeswoman and a security official said it was too early to rule out terrorism without knowing the hostage-taker’s demands. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to be publicly named. The national terrorism prosecutor’s office said it is following the situation. “It’s worrying. It all happened so quickly,” said Texier, who expressed surprise at the incident in what he described as a quiet neighbourhood on the banks of the Garonne River. He said the convenience store has been run for decades by a woman and her daughter who live in the adjacent building.

"29"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-conservatives-labour-seek-to-break-deadlock-as-brexit-talks-resume/"|"Elizabeth Piper Kylie MacLellan"|"Britain’s Conservative government held what it called “constructive and detailed” talks with the opposition Labour Party on Tuesday as the two sides struggle to break a parliamentary deadlock over the country’s exit from the European Union. After Prime Minister Theresa May’s deal was rejected three times in parliament and she was forced to delay Brexit, the government has spent more than four weeks in talks with Labour – negotiations that have done little to soften positions in either party. So far, there has been no agreement. “Today’s meeting was constructive and detailed. The teams have agreed to meet again for follow-up talks tomorrow afternoon, recognising the need to resolve the current Brexit deadlock in Parliament,” said a Downing Street spokesman. However, Labour’s business spokeswoman Rebecca Long-Bailey said the government had not offered any new concessions. “They haven’t moved on any of their previous positions as yet,” she told ITV News. The government also conceded on Tuesday that Britain would take part in European Parliament elections this month, a poll that could deliver more bruising results to both major parties. Almost three years after Britain voted to leave the EU, there is little clarity about how, when or even if Brexit will happen. David Lidington, May’s de facto deputy, said that despite the country taking part in the European elections on May 23, there was still time to avoid those elected taking their seats. “Ideally we would like to be in a situation where those MEPs from the UK never actually take their seats in the European Parliament, certainly to get this done and dusted by the summer recess,” he said, referring to parliament’s summer break that usually begins in the second half of July. May deeply regretted the UK having to take part in the elections, her spokesman said, describing the prime minister as determined to find a way to get a deal to leave the EU over the line. The Labour talks are an attempt by May to find a new path to what she calls “a stable majority” for a deal. Earlier, May told her cabinet that last week’s local elections, when the Conservatives lost hundreds of council seats, underlined the need to get on with Brexit. “The prime minister said that while an agreement with the opposition had not been reached, the public had sent a clear message in the local elections that they want both of the main parties to get on with delivering Brexit,” her spokesman said she told ministers. However, many pro-EU lawmakers used the election results to argue the tide is turning against Brexit after the Liberal Democrats, who oppose Brexit and want a second referendum, gained many council seats. Taking part in the European elections is a further blow to May, who secured a divorce deal with the EU in November but has been unable to implement the agreement and faces growing calls to bring forward her decision to stand down as prime minister. She was to meet the chairman of the Conservative 1922 Committee, an influential party group that can make or break Conservative Party leaders, on Tuesday. A spokesman described it as a regular meeting, though some newspapers reported that its chairman, Graham Brady, would demand a firm timetable for her departure. May was not alone in wanting to avoid European elections. Like the Conservatives, the Labour Party fears voters will again punish them, and vote for alternative parties that have a clearer stance on Brexit. Conservative Brexit supporters might flock to the newly launched Brexit Party of former UKIP leader Nigel Farage. Pro-EU Labour voters could turn to Change UK, another new party, or support the Liberal Democrats. But with both major parties, like much of the country, deeply divided over Brexit, any breakthrough from the current round of talks might be hard to come by. Labour sources were dismissive of weekend reports the government would offer new concessions, including a temporary customs union with the EU until a national election due in June 2022, saying such a proposal would not go far enough. That offer was quickly played down by Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who said he did not believe a post-Brexit customs union would offer a sustainable long-term solution. “I want to look at whatever deal is come to between the parties and I know this is a crucial week,” he told BBC radio.

Paddock Saw Nang and Mike Ives"|"Tuesday brought rare good news from Myanmar: photographs and videos of two beaming journalists, reunited with their wives and young children after spending 16 months in prison. The release of the journalists, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, who were detained for covering Myanmar’s deadly crackdown on the Rohingya minority group, is likely to relieve immediate pressure on the country’s quasidemocratic government from world leaders, rights organizations and others who had rallied to their cause. But the act does not move the needle for freedom of expression and other rights that are in jeopardy in the country formerly known as Burma, analysts and activists say. Dozens of political detainees are languishing behind bars, and dozens more face criminal defamation charges. “It is something to celebrate that these two were released,” said David Mathieson, an independent analyst in Yangon, Myanmar’s largest city. “But the picture remains quite bleak when it comes to press freedom.” Mr. Lone, 33, and Mr. Soe Oo, 29, were freed as part of a broader presidential amnesty for thousands of prisoners. A few weeks earlier, the Supreme Court had rejected a final appeal of their seven-year prison sentence. “This was the easiest step for them to take to repair relations with the West,” Mr. Mathieson said of the reporters’ release. Analysts said Myanmar’s civilian leaders may have hoped to ease international pressure over the case – itself a reminder of the military’s campaign in 2017 to expel the Rohingya, a mostly Muslim ethnic group, from western Myanmar. The military killed thousands of people, burning villages, raping women and girls, and forcing more than 750,000 Rohingya to flee to Bangladesh where they now live in refugee camps. United Nations officials have called it genocide. Mr. Lone and Mr. Soe Oo, reporters for the news agency Reuters, uncovered a military massacre of 10 Rohingya villagers in 2017. The two were arrested in December, 2017, and sentenced in September under the colonial-era Official Secrets Act. Their crime was receiving documents from a police officer as part of their investigation. (The journalists testified at their trial that they were arrested so quickly that they never had a chance to look at the documents.) In April, Mr. Lone and Mr. Soe Oo, along with their colleagues at Reuters, were awarded the Pulitzer Prize for international reporting, one of journalism’s most prestigious honours. Zaw Htay, a government spokesman, said Tuesday that the reporters’ pardon had been approved after their relatives petitioned President Win Myint and Aung San Suu Kyi, the country’s civilian leader. Their release prompted an outpouring of elation from supporters around the world. But, analysts and rights activists said it did not allay the broader concern that freedom of expression in Myanmar is on a steady decline. “We should not forget that this has been a test of Myanmar’s new democracy and that the test has failed,” Yin Yadanar Thein of the advocacy group Free Expression Myanmar said of the reporters’ original conviction. Ko Bo Kyi, a founder of the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, another advocacy group in Myanmar, said that only 10 of the more than 23,000 inmates released since last month in the government’s general amnesty were what he would consider political prisoners. By his count, he added, 25 more political prisoners were behind bars and an additional 283 were facing trial. In one prominent example, a well-known Myanmar filmmaker and rights activist, Min Htin Ko Ko Gyi, was arrested last month after a military officer sued him for a Facebook post criticizing the country’s military-drafted Constitution. He could face up to two years in prison if convicted. Since 2016, Myanmar has been ruled by the military and civilian-elected officials under an awkward power-sharing arrangement. The civilian government is led by Ms. Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate who has disappointed the international community by frequently siding with the military. She holds the post of state counsellor and has declared that she is above the President. Before the two reporters went on trial, she declared them guilty in a rare public interview. But experts said the President, Mr. Myint, had lately seemed more amenable to releasing them. “He wouldn’t act, though, without her green light,” said Richard Horsey, a political analyst and former UN official in Yangon. Phil Robertson, the deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said the journalists’ release was clearly the result of international pressure. “The problem is there are literally dozens of other reporters and bloggers facing prosecution, and none of them enjoy the kind of visibility that Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo had,” he said. The government may also have had a financial incentive: Amid the outcry over the military’s atrocities against the Rohingya, the European Union has said it is considering a suspension of trade privileges for Myanmar. Local garment companies say that hundreds of thousands of jobs are at risk.

Acting police chief C.D. Wickramaratne also said in a statement that explosives the Islamic State-linked group stocked for use in more attacks have been seized. The bombings killed 257 people and wounded hundreds at three churches and three hotels. Seven suicide bombers died at their targets while another exploded his device later at a guest house after it failed to detonate at a leading tourist hotel. A ninth killed herself to avoid capture by police at her home. Police have detained 73 suspects for investigation since the bombings and have seized stocks of explosives, improvised explosive devices and hundreds of swords. They also found US$140,000 in cash in bank accounts connected to the group and another US$40-million worth of assets in land, houses, vehicles and jewellery, police said late on Monday. Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena said in an interview with the Associated Press on Tuesday that “all” of the suspects’ explosives, weapons, safe houses and training centres have been found in the 16 days since the blasts. He said those things weren’t discovered earlier because of weaknesses in Sri Lanka’s intelligence divisions. Authorities have repeatedly said another attack from the extremist group is possible, but Mr. Sirisena said it is now safe for tourists to return. “The country is in a safe position right now,” he said. Sri Lanka’s Catholic church hierarchy closed churches for a second weekend on Sunday as the faithful celebrated Mass from home watching live on television. But on Tuesday, one of the churches targeted in the attacks, St. Anthony’s Shrine in Colombo, opened part of the building to the public for the first time since the bombing, enabling devotees to pray in the church as was customary every Tuesday. Catholic schools remain closed after reports said two of their locations were to be attacked last weekend. Government-run schools reopened for students in higher classes on Monday, but fewer students attended out of fear. Army Commander Mahesh Senanayake on Monday urged the public to resume normal activities and trust in the security forces. “I ask the people not to fear unnecessarily, not to believe rumours … believe in the tri-forces and police that defeated one of deadliest terrorist organizations in the world,” he said, referring to ethnic Tamil separatists who fought a 26-year civil war. The conflict ended 10 years ago. The air force warned on Tuesday that it will shoot down drones in the country’s airspace if necessary, saying they are a threat to national security. Authorities banned drones after last month’s attacks, but some have been operated in some parts of the country, air force spokesman Gihan Seneviratne said.

The blast, a day after the beginning of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, went off at a police checkpoint near the Data Darbar, one of the largest Muslim shrines in South Asia, which attracts tens of thousands of visitors a year. “Police was the prime target in this attack. We are collecting forensic evidences to ascertain the nature of the blast,” said Ashfaq Khan, deputy inspector general of police operations in Lahore. A police spokesman said the death toll rose to 10, six of them civilians and four police, after a police officer died of his wounds. Officials earlier said eight police had died. At least 23 people were wounded. Muhammad Farooq, a spokesman for the city’s rescue services, said at least seven of the wounded were in critical condition. Police set up checkpoints on main roads leading to the shrine and hospitals were placed on alert, officials said. The attack was claimed by the Hizbul Ahrar, a splinter group of the Pakistani Taliban, a movement that has been fighting the government for years. In a statement, the group said the attack targeted police and had been timed to avoid civilian casualties. “This attack was carried out at a time when there were no civilians near the police,” said Abdul Aziz Yousafzai, a spokesman for the militant group. Prime Minister Imran Khan issued a statement condemning the attack and asking the provincial government to help the victims. Sufis, who follow a mystical form of Islam that has been practised in South Asia for centuries, have been regularly attacked by hardline Sunni Muslim militants in the past. In 2010, two suicide bombers struck the Data Darbar shrine killing 42 people and wounding 175, in an attack officials said was carried out by the Pakistani Taliban. Militant violence has since declined sharply in Pakistan after a sustained crackdown following the country’s deadliest attack in 2014, which killed more than 150 people, many children, at a school in the western city of Peshawar. Since an attack in a Lahore park targeting Christians celebrating Easter in 2016 killed more than 70 people, Pakistan’s second largest city has been largely quiet although an attack last year killed nine people. However, officials warned that Wednesday’s blast showed the need for vigilance during Ramadan. “People should remain aware of their surroundings when going to pray,” said a Punjab provincial minister, Mian Aslam. Police said a general security alert was in force but there had been no specific warning about a threat to the Data Darbar, which protected by heavy layers of security. The complex contains the shrine of Syed Ali bin-Osman Al-Hajvery, widely known as Data Ganj Bakhsh, an 11th century Sufi preacher originally from Ghazni in what is now Afghanistan.

The complex contains the shrine of Syed Ali bin-Osman Al-Hajvery, widely known as Data Ganj Bakhsh, an 11th century Sufi preacher originally from Ghazni in what is now Afghanistan.

"34"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-who-experts-recommend-ramping-up-ebola-vaccine-after-cases-surge-in/"|""|"World Health Organization experts recommended on Tuesday a dramatic expansion of vaccination against Ebola in Congo after a surge in cases showed that the strategy of vaccinating those known to be exposed to the disease was no longer sufficient. Health workers fighting against the second worst Ebola epidemic in history are now implementing a “ring” strategy, vaccinating anyone directly exposed to known cases of Ebola, and a second ring of those exposed to people in the first ring. But after four weeks of sharp increases in cases, the World Health Organization’s strategic advisory group (SAGE) of outside experts said the vaccine program was no longer big enough. A large share of new cases are now occurring in people who were not known contacts of earlier patients, and the disease is spreading to areas where it is impossible to trace contacts and swiftly vaccinate them. It recommended a number of changes, including expanding vaccination to a third ring of people exposed to those in the second ring, and “geographic” vaccinations that would target everyone at a location without trying to track their exposure. To prevent supplies of the vaccine, made by Merck, from running out in a much larger vaccination program, the WHO experts recommended using smaller doses. A second experimental vaccine made by Johnson & Johnson should also be rolled out. “We know that vaccination is saving lives in this outbreak,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement. “These recommendations account for ongoing insecurity and incorporate feedback from experts and from the affected communities that will help us continue to adapt the response.” Jeremy Farrar, an infectious disease specialist and director of the Wellcome Trust global health charity, welcomed the recommendations and described the Congo outbreak as “in a truly frightening phase.” “If there is any hope of bringing it under control there has to be a significant shift in the response,” he said in a comment e-mailed to Reuters. “Without support for this new approach this epidemic could reach the scale of the terrible events in West Africa in 2013-2016.” Farrar was referring to the largest Ebola outbreak in history, which infected 28,000 people in a vast epidemic that spread through Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone between 2013 and 2016. More than 11,300 people died. In the current Congo outbreak, the WHO says more than 111,000 people have been vaccinated since August. So far 1,045 of the 1,572 people with confirmed or probable Ebola have died in the outbreak, which has hit areas long prone to unrest. SAGE said the number of cases had risen rapidly in the past four weeks because security incidents had dramatically affected the tracing and monitoring of people who may have come into contact with Ebola. The Merck vaccine could run short if the outbreak continues, and doses should be halved to 0.5 ml for the primary and secondary rings, SAGE said, while they also proposed vaccination of a tertiary ring of contacts, who would receive 0.2 ml.

The U.S. Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA), which works to recover missing American troops around the world, said on Wednesday that it had not heard from North Korean officials since the second U.S.-North Korea summit, held in Hanoi in February, ended with no agreement. “As a result, our efforts to communicate with the Korean People’s Army regarding the possible resumption of joint recovery operations for 2019 have been suspended,” DPAA spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Hoffman said in a statement. “We have reached the point where we can no longer effectively plan, co-ordinate, and conduct field operations in (North Korea) during this fiscal year, which ends on September 30, 2019.” At their first summit in June last year, U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un signed a declaration committing to the recovery of remains of soldiers killed in the war. The two sides remain technically at war because a peace treaty was never signed. In July, North Korea handed over 55 boxes of human remains, a move Trump has hailed as evidence of the success of his negotiations with Kim. Since then, however, there has been little progress on resuming the search for the roughly 5,300 Americans believed to be lost in what is now North Korea. Despite that lack of progress, as recently as April 26 Trump touted the return of the remains and said they “continued to come back”. North Korea has also been silent about planned joint recovery operations with South Korea, which left the South Korean military to begin independently recovering remains in the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas in April. The United States and North Korea conducted joint searches for remains from 1996 until 2005, when Washington halted the operations citing concerns about the safety of its personnel as Pyongyang stepped up its nuclear program. The Hanoi summit in February fell apart over a failure to reconcile North Korean demands for sanctions relief with U.S. demands for Kim to give up a nuclear weapons program that now threatens the United States. Hoffman said the DPAA is still trying to determine whether new recovery operations might be possible. “We are assessing possible next steps in resuming communications with the KPA to plan for potential joint recovery operations during Fiscal Year 2020,” he said.

"36"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-north-korea-says-recent-rocket-drill-was-regular-and-self-defensive/"|"Josh Smith"|"North Korea’s “strike drill” last week at which leader Kim Jong-un oversaw the launch of rockets and at least one short-range ballistic missile was “regular and self-defensive,” the country’s foreign ministry said on Wednesday. “The recent drill conducted by our army is nothing more than part of the regular military training, and it has neither targeted anyone nor led to an aggravation of the situation in the region,” an unidentified ministry spokesperson said in a statement to the state-run KCNA news agency. Acting U.S. Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan told a congressional hearing on Wednesday that North Korea launched “rockets and missiles," the first time the Pentagon has detailed what it believes Pyongyang fired. Saturday’s drill was the first test of a ballistic missile by North Korea since it launched a long-range intercontinental ballistic missile in November, 2017. It came in the wake of talks with the United States and South Korea stalling in February and raised alarms in both countries, which have been seeking to persuade Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. Seoul responded on Saturday by calling on its northern neighbour to “stop acts that escalate military tension on the Korean Peninsula.” In a second statement carried by KCNA on Wednesday, a spokesman for the North Korean office in charge of military engagement with South Korea lashed out at Seoul over any suggestion that the rocket drills had violated an inter-Korean agreement aimed at reducing military tension. “The South Korean military should take a close look at the inter Korean military agreement and recall what it has done itself before talking nonsense that it was against the spirit of the agreement,” the spokesperson said, according to KCNA. The second statement also criticized last week’s test of a U.S. Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) by the U.S. Air Force out of California over the Pacific, saying South Korea was in no position to criticize North Korea. “The South Korean military has no right to say a word to its fellow countrymen when it acted like a mute who ate honey when the United States fired a Minuteman ICBM which threatens us,” the military spokesman said. According to a subsequent English-language report on KCNA, the spokesman also took aim at Seoul for staging “provocative” combined air drills with the United States and for allowing the stationing of a U.S. THAAD anti-missile system on its territory. It also appeared to hint at the possibility of more weapons tests, saying: “The south Korean military were astonished by the recent strike drill. It might fall into a swoon to see a strike drill involving more powerful cutting-edge weapons.” U.S. President Donald Trump, who has met with Mr. Kim twice, said on Saturday he was still confident he could make a deal with him, and U.S. and South Korean officials have subsequently played down last week’s tests. North Korea’s criticism of Seoul has come even as South Korea has said it is working on a plan to send humanitarian food aid to North Korea after the United Nations reported the country had suffered its worst harvest in decades, leaving many there chronically short of food. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Wednesday that the United States would not stand in the way if South Korea went ahead with that. “Our position in regards to North Korea is going to continue to be the maximum pressure campaign. Our focus is on the denuclearization,” Ms. Sanders told reporters, referring to a U.S.-led sanctions campaign against North Korea aimed at pressuring it to give up its nuclear weapons. However, she added, referring to food aid: “If South Korea moves forward on that front, we’re not going to intervene.” South Korea said after a call between its President Moon Jae-in and Mr. Trump on Tuesday that the U.S. President supported the plan to provide humanitarian food aid. The U.S. State Department last week blamed the shortages on the North Korean government and said it could meet its people’s needs if it redirected state funds from its weapons programs. North Korea’s foreign ministry statement hit back at “spiteful remarks” about the tests from unnamed critics, warning that “baseless allegations” might “produce a result of driving us to the direction which neither we nor they want to see at all.” The spokesperson complained said there was a double standard, with South Korea and the United States carrying out military drills with little criticism. “Only our regular and self-defensive military drill is branded as provocative, and this is an undisguised manifestation of the attempt to press the gradual disarmament of our state and finally invade us,” the spokesperson said. “We think this is very much unpleasant and regrettable, and we sound a note of warning.” After meeting with Mr. Kim for the first time in June last year, Mr. Trump abruptly announced he was cancelling all large-scale military exercises with South Korea. Smaller exercises have continued, however, drawing regular criticism from Pyongyang. North Korea had maintained a freeze in nuclear and ballistic missiles testing in place since 2017, a fact Mr. Trump has repeatedly pointed to as an important achievement from his engagement with Pyongyang.

"37"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-iran-pulls-back-on-nuclear-pact-says-it-will-resume-uranium/"|"Amir Vahdat Jon Gambrell"|"Iran threatened on Wednesday to enrich its uranium stockpile closer to weapons-grade levels in 60 days if world powers fail to negotiate new terms for its 2015 nuclear deal, raising regional tensions as a U.S. aircraft carrier and bombers headed to the Middle East to confront Tehran. A televised address by President Hassan Rouhani, who once pledged that the landmark deal would draw Iran closer to the West, saw the cleric instead press Europe to shield Tehran from the sanctions imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump withdrawing the United States from the agreement exactly a year earlier. Mr. Rouhani’s threats put the world on notice that it cannot continue to rely on Iran complying with terms of the unravelling deal in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, a U.S. campaign of sanctions hammering Iran’s anemic economy and blocking its sale of oil on the global market is only making life worse, putting further pressure on both its Shia theocracy and its 80 million people. Later Wednesday, Mr. Trump issued an executive order announcing new sanctions targeting Iran’s steel, aluminum, copper and iron sectors, which provide foreign currency earnings for Tehran. Mr. Rouhani earlier compared the situation to a medical emergency for the Islamic Republic, only 40 years after its founding. “We felt that the nuclear deal needs a surgery and the painkiller pills of the last year have been ineffective,” Mr. Rouhani said. “This surgery is for saving the deal, not destroying it.” Iran on Wednesday stopped its sale of excess uranium and heavy water as a first step, Mr. Rouhani said, something required under the deal. The United States last week ended deals allowing Iran to exchange its enriched uranium for unrefined yellowcake uranium with Russia, and to sell its heavy water, which is used as a coolant in nuclear reactors, to Oman. In 60 days, if no new deal is in place, Iran will increase its enrichment of uranium beyond the accord-permitted 3.67 per cent, which can fuel a commercial nuclear power plant. Rouhani did not say how far Iran would be willing to enrich, although the head of its nuclear program again reiterated that Iran could reach 20-per-cent enrichment within four days. Once a country enriches uranium to around 20 per cent, scientists say the time needed to reach the 90-per-cent threshold for weapons-grade uranium is halved. Iran long has maintained its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. However, Iranian state television’s English-language service Press TV, citing sources close to presidency, said the country would withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty if Europeans sought to sanction Iran at the UN Security Council. Mr. Rouhani also said that if the 60 days pass without action, Iran will halt a Chinese-led effort to redesign its Arak heavy water nuclear reactor. Such reactors produce plutonium that can be used in nuclear weapons. Iran notified Britain, Russia, China, the European Union, France and Germany of its decision earlier in the day. All were signatories to the nuclear deal and continue to support it. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif met Wednesday in Moscow with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, and offered a letter as well. “If the five countries join negotiations and help Iran to reach its benefits in the field of oil and banking, Iran will return to its commitments according to the nuclear deal,” Mr. Rouhani said. Mr. Zarif separately issued his own warning from Moscow. “After a year of patience, Iran stops measures that [the] US has made impossible to continue,” he tweeted. World powers have “a narrowing window to reverse this.” Reaction came swiftly from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a staunch critic of Iran and the nuclear deal. “I heard that Iran intends to continue its nuclear program. We will not allow Iran to obtain nuclear weapons,” Mr. Netanyahu said. “We will continue to fight those who seek to take our lives, and we will thrust our roots even deeper into the soil of our homeland.” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in London, said the United States “will wait and observe” what Iran does next. “They have made have made a number of statements about actions they have threatened to do in order to get the world to jump,” Mr. Pompeo said. Mr. Rouhani also made an implicit threat as well to Europe, saying Iran now co-operates on issues such as targeting Afghan opium and hashish traffickers and controlling immigration. “You are obliged … for your own security, for protecting your youths against drugs as well as controlling influx of immigrants,” the President said. British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt called Iran’s threat to resume higher enrichment of uranium an “unwelcome step.” French Defence Secretary Florence Parly was much more dire. “Nothing would be worse than Iran leaving this deal,” he told BMFTV. Iran’s move comes at a sensitive moment in the wider Middle East. The White House said it dispatched the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and B-52 bombers to the Persian Gulf over what it described as a new threat from Iran. Israel, which has conducted pre-emptive bombings of nuclear facilities in Iraq and Syria, has vowed to never allow Iran to obtain an atomic weapon. Apparently responding to that, the general staff of Iran’s armed forces issued a statement applauding Mr. Rouhani’s decision and warning its enemies. “Any possible movement by them will face a regrettable response by Iranian nation and its armed forces,” the statement said, according to the semi-official Fars news agency. The 2015 deal lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for limits on its nuclear program. It reached the deal after years of negotiations, including secret talks in Oman between Iran and the administration of former president Barack Obama. The United States withdrew from the deal under Mr. Trump, whose administration contends the accord should have limited Iran’s ballistic missile program and what it describes as Tehran’s malign regional influence. However, the UN’s atomic watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, repeatedly has verified that Iran stuck to terms of the deal. The agency did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday. After the United States withdrew from the accord, it restored the crippling sanctions, exacerbating a severe economic crisis. The Iranian rial, which traded at 32,000 to US$1 at the time of the accord, traded Wednesday at 153,500. That Iran chose to keep its excess uranium and heavy water first, rather than abandon the accord in its entirety, shows it still hopes to secure a deal. In years of negotiations over its nuclear program, Iran similarly has gone step-by-step in ramping its activities while holding talks. It also protects Mr. Rouhani, a relative moderate cleric within Iran’s Shia theocracy, from criticism by hard-liners who long maintained Iran gave up too much in the nuclear deal. On the streets of Tehran, the mood was mixed as people are struggling to make ends meet as the Iranian currency collapses. “It was a good but late decision by Iran,” said Soroush Kamali, a 21-year-old geography student. “The West should learn that they cannot remain idle while Iranian people are suffering from sanctions.” Zahra Ahari, a 43-year-old homemaker, simply wished for things to get better. “I do not understand the terms and words of officials. They should do something to make our life easier,” Ahari said. “I hope the new decision will have such an impact.” "|"Iran threatens more uranium enrichment if world powers fail to negotiate new terms for nuclear deal"|"2019-05-08T05:33:13-0400"|"iran,nuclear,nuclear pact,Hassan Rouhani,sanctions,nuclear deal,deal,Iran,uranium,tehran,water,accord,united,program,Press TV", 
"38"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-former-diplomat-and-security-council-president-to-argue-the-end-of/"|"Nathan VanderKlippe"|"Under President Xi Jinping, China is making an audacious effort to supplant the United States as the world’s superpower. Projecting economic heft through Made in China 2025, a plan to become the leading maker of next-generation technologies; military might with naval manoeuvres in the South China Sea; and diplomatic sway by building new trade corridors across Eurasia through the Belt and Road Initiative, China is determined to dominate the 21st century even as President Donald Trump’s America turns inward. But China remains an oppressive autocracy, confining over one million of its citizens to internment camps and denying basic democratic freedoms to the rest. Thursday’s Munk Debate will clash over the resolution: China is a threat to the international liberal order. The world as we know it is drawing to a close, argues former Singaporean diplomat Kishore Mahbubani. By at least one economic measure, the United States stopped being the pre-eminent economic power in 2014, when it slipped behind China in purchasing power parity. And as Beijing reclaims its historical place at the pinnacle of the economic world – a place it has occupied for much of the past two millenniums – Western influence will correspondingly dim. “We are at an inflection point in world history,” he says in an interview with The Globe and Mail. But fear not, he hastens to add. “The Chinese basically have no desire to take over the world. In fact, they’re quite happy to see the United States carry on as the policeman of the world. They don’t want to take it over.” Mr. Mahbubani is an academic whose book Has the West Lost It? makes the argument for what he calls “the defining truth of our times: that a cycle of Western domination of the world is coming to a natural end.” Munk Debates: Former Trump adviser H.R. McMaster says jailing of Canadians ‘should tell you all you need to know’ about China The Dalhousie University-educated career public servant, a former president of the United Nations Security Council, is hardly an outlier in pointing to the inevitability of China’s ascension. But he marshals his argument as a sunny counterpoint to the coalescing consensus among major Western countries that China’s rise portends a mortal threat to the modern liberal order. The European Union has called China “an economic competitor in the pursuit of technological leadership and a systemic rival promoting alternative models of governance.” In the United States, national security adviser John Bolton has accused China of “predatory actions” and proposed returning it to its “proper place.” In late April, Kiron Skinner, the director of policy planning at the U.S. State Department, described “a fight with a really different civilization,” saying it is “the first time that we will have a great power competitor that is not Caucasian” in comments reported by the Washington Examiner. Mr. Mahbubani sees no cause for such alarm. China’s “influence will definitely grow in the world. For sure,” he says. And “I think the Chinese obviously, as they become bigger and bigger, will naturally want to be treated with more respect.” Yet for many countries, including Canada, Mr. Mahbubani sees little reason for worry. “China is not going to influence Canada at all. You are effectively – forgive my bluntness – almost like a political part of the American nation.” In Italy, which recently signed on to China’s Belt and Road Initiative, Beijing provides a new option for economic growth – an alternative to constraints imposed by European heavyweights such as Germany and France. Others may fare differently; in Australia, Mr. Mahbubani says, Beijing will foment a “painful existential dilemma” for a country whose defence is tied to the United States but whose economy is increasingly dependent on China. The United States, meanwhile, faces a “major psychological adjustment” to a world where it is no longer a solitary superpower. But the larger and more important question, he says, “is whether or not China will play by the rules. Or will China create new rules?” This is where he sharply differs from those preaching caution, if not hostility, toward Beijing. “I actually was hoping that, with the return of Asia, we could still maintain the multilateral rules-based order from 1945. That was a gift from the West to the rest of the world,” Mr. Mahbubani says. “But the danger now is that it may break down. And the question is: Where is the biggest threat coming from? Is it coming from China? Or is it coming from the United States?” He suggests looking at which country has most often undermined, abandoned or sought to withdraw from multilateral agreements in recent years. For the United States, it’s a mounting tally that includes the Paris climate agreement, the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, the International Court of Justice, the International Criminal Court, the World Trade Organization Appellate Body, an optional protocol under the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and a series of UN organizations, including UNESCO and the Human Rights Council. “As of now, the country that is the most openly and honestly opposed to the multilateral order is the Trump administration. That’s a fact,” Mr. Mahbubani said. China, by comparison, has cast itself as a key supporter of international commerce and a pillar against climate change, while committing itself to reform of the WTO. The image of Chinese President Xi Jinping as a new guardian of global trade and environmental health has been questioned by skeptics who point out that China maintains a deeply protectionist domestic economic system and is the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases. But “I don’t take President Xi Jinping at his word,” Mr. Mahbubani said. “I look at China’s national interest. And are China’s national interests served by a stronger rules-based order or are China’s interests served by a weaker rules-based order? Logically speaking, if you are the world’s number one trading power, you actually have a lot to lose if the international rules-based order breaks down. And, number two, China’s fundamental preoccupation is with domestic stability and not with trying to create international involvements. China is a status quo power globally.” How can that notion be squared with the expansion of Chinese power as seen, for example, in the South China Sea, where Beijing has co-ordinated the expansion of reefs into militarized islands far from its mainland? Mr. Mahbubani points out that countries such as Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines were actually the first to begin land-building in those waters. China, he says, has the military capability to seize islands – but it hasn’t, opting instead to build artificial ones. “So it is still respecting the rules of the game.” (Beijing, however, refused to accept a ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration against its conduct in waters near the Philippines.) Elsewhere, Mr. Mahbubani says, problems have arisen when rules have yet to be drafted. Take the dispute over Huawei. Everyone spies, he says, and the best path forward lies not in blocking the company but in drafting internationally accepted boundaries for that conduct. “My own solution to these things is: Let’s work out a set of multilateral rules on what you should or should not do in the area of what I call cyberwarfare,” he says. That same logic underpins his broader argument that those seeking to keep an ascendant Beijing from dictating the rules are making a mistake when they target China alone. “The best way for the United States to slip the handcuffs of multilateralism onto China is to slip the handcuffs of multilateralism on itself,” he says. “Every loophole the United States creates in international law today is a loophole that China will walk through tomorrow.” "|"Munk Debates: Former UN Security Council president Kishore Mahbubani details why China stands to lose if rules-based order evaporates"|"2019-05-08T17:41:44-0400"|"munk debates,china,Beijing,Has the West Lost It?,Western domination,United Nations Security Council,European Union,china's position in the world,John Bolton,Belt and Road Initiative,Xi Jinping,China,world,united,order", 
"39"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-un-chief-warns-total-disaster-if-warming-not-stopped/"|"Seth Borenstein Edith M. Lederer"|"The United Nations Secretary-General said the world must dramatically change the way it fuels factories, vehicles and homes to limit future warming to a level scientists call nearly impossible. That’s because the alternative “would mean a catastrophic situation for the whole world,” Antonio Guterres told The Associated Press in an exclusive interview. Guterres said he’s about to tour Pacific islands to see how climate change is devastating them as part of his renewed push to fight it. He is summoning world leaders to the U.N. in September to tell them “they need to do much more in order for us to be able to reverse the present trends and to defeat the climate change.” That means, he said, the world has to change, not in small incremental ways but in big “transformative” ways, into a green economy with electric vehicles and “clean cities.” Guterres said he will ask leaders to stop subsidizing fossil fuels. Burning coal, oil and gas triggers warming by releasing heat-trapping gases. He said he wants countries to build no new coal power plants after 2020. He wants them to put a price on the use of carbon. And ultimately he wants to make sure that by 2050 the world is no longer putting more greenhouse gases into the air than nature sucks out. Global temperatures have already risen about 1.8 degrees (1 degree Celsius) since the industrial age began. The issue is how much more the thermometers will rise. In 2015, the world’s nations set a goal to limit global warming to no more than 0.9 degrees (0.5 degrees Celsius) from now. Most scientists say it is highly unlikely, if not outright undoable, to keep man-made climate change that low, especially since emissions of heat trapping gases are rising, renewable energy growth is plateauing, and some countries’ leaders and voters are balking. A panel of scientists the U.N. asked to look at the issue ran computer models for more than 500 future scenarios, and less than 2% achieved those warming limits. Guterres said the wholesale economic changes needed to keep the temperature from rising another degree or more may be painful, but there will be more pain if the world fails. “If you don’t hang on to that goal, what you’ll achieve is a total disaster,” the secretary-general said in his 38th floor conference room. If countries only do what they promised in the 2015 Paris climate agreement, it would be catastrophic because the world would warm by another 4.5 degrees (2.5 degrees Celsius), Guterres said, adding “that is why we need to dramatically accelerate... what everybody knows needs to be done.” Yet, globally the trends are going the other way. University of Michigan environment dean Jonathan Overpeck said it looks unlikely that the world could prevent another 1.8 degrees (1 Celsius) of warming, let alone 0.9 degrees. And in an odd way that gives the U.N. chief optimism. Because as disasters mount and deaths increase, the public, especially youths, will realize that warming is “a dramatic threat to the whole of humankind,” Guterres said. So the worse it gets, the more people will demand change, he said. That’s why he’s about to visit the islands of Fiji, Tuvalu and Vanuatu in the Pacific Ocean, which he said is hit hardest by climate change. Guterres said he wants to use the determination and moral authority of the people who live on the threatened islands to convince world leaders to make necessary change. Here are some excerpts from the 25-minute interview with Guterres, who said he used to love steak houses but now only goes once every three months because livestock contribute significantly to warming. The questions and answers have been edited for clarity and length: Q: How can you be optimistic? A: That is the paradox. Things are getting worse. Temperatures are rising faster than expected. We see the Arctic melting. We see glaciers disappearing. We see corals bleaching. We see biodiversity being dramatically threatened. So things are getting worse and worse. But the political will has been slow. We need to reverse this trend. We need to make people understand that this is not sustainable. And the reason why I’m optimistic is that I feel that more and more people are convinced of that. And as more and more people are convinced of that, I believe governments will feel the need to increase their political will which at this present moment is still lagging behind. You have seen the fantastic attitude of young girls and boys making a strike in favour of climate action. You see more and more business and communities assuming responsibilities. Q: Can you fight climate change and biodiversity loss at the same time? A: Climate change is a major threat to biodiversity. It’s because of climate change that species are disappearing. So we need at the same time to be concerned with the climate action... with our oceans... to make sure that we keep the richness of a planet that was created by God. And I don’t believe God would be very happy to see many of his creatures disappearing.“ Q: How do you see the United States and the Trump administration on climate? A: In the United States I disagree with the policies that the government has implemented. But I see fantastic attitudes and fantastic developments in what is done by large businesses, by cities, by the civil society. I can see the United States a country with an enormous potential to achieve what needs to be achieved for us to be able to defeat climate change.

"40"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-south-africans-vote-in-election-that-could-decide-the-ruling-african/"|"Geoffrey York"|"The long-ruling African National Congress has taken an early lead in South Africa’s national elections, as President Cyril Ramaphosa seeks a stronger mandate for an anti-corruption campaign after years of embarrassing scandals under his predecessor, Jacob Zuma. Twenty-five years after the end of apartheid, millions of South Africans voted Wednesday in an election that could determine the fate of Mr. Ramaphosa’s efforts to push out the Zuma faction and gain greater control of his divided party. The ANC, the former liberation movement that has governed the country since the first democratic election in 1994, is almost certain to win. But its margin of victory will help decide whether Mr. Ramaphosa can move ahead with his much-touted efforts to tackle the corruption scandals that grew dramatically worse under Mr. Zuma. The early results on Wednesday showed that the ANC had won about 52 per cent of the votes counted. The biggest opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, had gained about 29 per cent of the votes. But less than 11 per cent of voting districts had reported their results in the early tally, and most of the districts were in regions where the ANC is traditionally weaker than it is nationally. Opinion polls in the final days of the campaign have suggested the ANC will get between 53 per cent and 62 per cent of the vote. Its support fell to 62 per cent from 66 per cent in the previous election, in 2014, and most analysts are expecting a further decline this time. Mr. Ramaphosa, a wealthy businessman and former union leader, is more popular than his party. But his supporters are fighting an internal feud with supporters of Mr. Zuma, who resigned last year after years of corruption allegations. If the ANC wins a clear victory, it could strengthen Mr. Ramaphosa’s hand in the factional battles, allowing him to push ahead with his anti-corruption campaign. It would also boost South Africa’s stock market and currency, since investors see Mr. Ramaphosa as a market-friendly leader of the ANC’s liberal faction. But the Zuma faction has remained heavily influential in the party, and there are reports that Mr. Zuma has unofficially supported several smaller parties – including a new church-backed party – that could erode the ANC’s margin of victory. A slippage in ANC support could open the door for Mr. Zuma to regain influence in the party and government. World Bank study on South Africa exposes ANC’s failure to reduce poverty Anti-immigrant attacks inflame South African election South Africa’s populist party EFF gains traction as country sees rise in apathy and alienation Despite Mr. Ramaphosa’s early attempts to clean up the most graft-ridden elements in his party, many voters were angered that the ANC refused to get rid of several cabinet ministers and top officials who have been linked to corruption. They remained on the party’s list for parliamentary seats, provoking a storm of criticism in the country. Millions of South Africans, disenchanted by years of economic stagnation and scandals, have not bothered to register as voters. The economy has repeatedly slipped into recession in recent years, growth has remained slow and the unemployment rate has remained stubbornly high. Only about 75 per cent of eligible voters have registered to vote in this election – the lowest percentage since apartheid. Younger people, in particular, have abandoned the electoral system, with only 19 per cent of the youngest eligible voters (18 and 19 years old) registering to vote this time, a much smaller percentage than in previous elections. One of the main beneficiaries of the growing disenchantment with the ANC is a relatively new party, the radical left-wing Economic Freedom Fighters. Polls suggest it could increase its share of the vote to about 11 per cent this time, compared with 6 per cent in the previous election. The EFF, headed by a former ANC youth leader, is campaigning for the seizure of white-owned farmland. It has helped push the ANC to promise faster action in support of land redistribution. The ANC has introduced a plan to amend the constitution to allow the government to take possession of farmland without compensation. The Democratic Alliance has failed to capitalize on disillusionment with the ANC. Some pollsters suggest it might make a marginal improvement on the 22 per cent it gained in the previous national election, but others predict it could slip below 20 per cent. While there is little doubt of an ANC victory at the national level, the governing party is at risk of losing control of South Africa’s economic heartland, the province of Gauteng, where Johannesburg and Pretoria are located. Some analysts believe its support could fall below 50 per cent there, opening the door for a possible coalition government among the opposition parties. The ANC has already lost control of Johannesburg and Pretoria, where the opposition parties were able to forge coalitions after the previous local elections, in 2016.

Solomon Banda Nicholas Riccardi"|"When a gunman burst into his high school classroom, Kendrick Castillo did not hesitate. The 18-year-old immediately charged, pinning the attacker to the wall before Castillo was fatally shot protecting classmates, witnesses said. As he charged, so did two other students. One of them, Brendan Bialy, wrestled the gun from the shooter’s hand and the students subdued him. A second shooter was captured by an armed security guard. Authorities said these acts of bravery helped minimize the bloodshed from Tuesday’s attack, which also wounded eight people. “We’re going to hear about very heroic things that have taken place at the school,” Douglas County Sheriff Tony Spurlock said Wednesday. The attackers were identified by law enforcement officials as 18-year-old Devon Erickson and a 16-year-old who prosecutors identified as Maya McKinney but whose attorney said uses male pronouns and the name Alec. The two allegedly walked into the STEM School Highlands Ranch through an entrance without metal detectors and opened fire in two classrooms. Because the attack happened only miles from Columbine High School and just weeks after the shooting’s 20th anniversary, questions quickly arose about whether it was inspired by the 1999 massacre. But investigators offered no immediate motive. Castillo sprang into action against the shooter “and immediately was on top of him with complete disregard for his own safety,” said Bialy, a close friend of Castillo’s who has signed up to join the Marines. A member of the school’s robotics club and a relentless tinkerer, Castillo had an infectious smile and gentle sense of humour, according to friends. He worked part-time at a local manufacturing company that had offered him a job after an internship because he was such a standout employee. “To find he went down as a hero, I’m not surprised. That’s exactly who Kendrick was,” said Rachel Short, president of the company, Baccara. Cecilia Bedard, 19, had known Castillo since elementary school and said he was always friendly, modest and excited to help people. He made a point of always joining his father at Knights of Columbus fundraisers and bingo nights. “He was amazing,” Bedard said. “He was honestly the sweetest kid I ever met. Never said a mean joke.” Bialy smiled as he recounted the struggle with the shooter to reporters, saying that he wanted to focus on the positive. “They completely and utterly failed in a matter of half a minute,” he said of the attackers. “What I saw yesterday was the absolute best of people,” he added. Bialy would not identify the third student who helped subdue the gunman, but the family of Joshua Jones put out a statement saying he was shot twice while disarming one of the attackers. The security guard who detained the second armed suspect was employed by Boss High Level Protection, a company started by a former SWAT team leader who responded to the Columbine shooting. The owner, Grant Whitus, told The Associated Press the security guard is a former Marine who ran to the area of the shootings and confronted one of the armed students in a hallway. The guard drew his weapon and apprehended the person, Whitus said. “He doesn’t even realize how many lives he saved by stopping a school shooting,” Whitus said. About 2,000 people held a vigil at a nearby high school Wednesday night to honour the victims and survivors of the attack. Both suspects were students at the school, and they were not previously known to authorities, Spurlock said. Erickson made his first court appearance Wednesday and kept his head down. His black hair, streaked with purple dye, covered his face as he nodded in response to most of District Court Judge Theresa Slade’s questions. At one point, the judge requested a verbal answer to whether he had any questions about the proceedings. Erickson simply replied “No.” McKinney, who has a short brown haircut, made eye contact with the judge and answered questions in a clear but quiet voice, saying “Yes, your honour” and “No, your honour.” District attorney George Brauchler said he has not decided whether to file adult charges but added that McKinney is old enough to be charged as an adult without a judge’s review. Formal charges were expected to be filed by Friday. Brauchler said he could not discuss any motive or weapons used in the attack. A message left at a phone number listed for Erickson’s home was not immediately returned. Josh Dutton, 18, said he was close friends with Erickson in middle school but had not seen him for four years while attending a different high school. On Sunday, he spotted Erickson at a local light rail station and said he was shocked at how much his friend had changed. Erickson wore all black and was significantly thinner and did not seem interested in talking. “He said he’d just turned 18 and he owned rifles,” Dutton said. The shooting took place exactly a week after a gunman killed two students and wounded four at the University of North Carolina-Charlotte. In that case as well, one of the fatalities was a student who charged the attacker. The Colorado attack unfolded came nearly three weeks after neighbouring Littleton marked the anniversary of the Columbine attack that killed 13 people. The two schools are separated by about 7 miles (11 kilometres) in adjacent communities south of Denver. Brauchler said the community remains resilient in the face of multiple shootings, including Columbine, the 2012 theatre shooting in the Denver suburb of Aurora and the 2013 shooting at Arapahoe High School. The attacks are “aberrant acts” although they might seem otherwise to the rest of the world, he said. “Who we are is a kind, compassionate, caring people, and this does not define us.” "|"Colorado teen who charged attackers was lone death in school shooting"|"2019-05-08T09:39:29-0400"|"Colorado,Colorado school shooting,school shooting,STEM School,Highlands Ranch,news,united states,gun control,school,erickson,castillo,shooting,people,attack,student",

But the Kurdish-led force now faces protests by local Arab tribesmen in Deir el-Zour province demanding better services, jobs and a bigger role in decision-making in the predominantly Arab, oil-rich and fertile region. Though limited to about a dozen villages for now, the demonstrations are a growing challenge to the U.S. and its local partners at a time when President Donald Trump plans to reduce America’s military presence in Syria. On Thursday, the Kurdish-led fighters opened fire at protesters in the village of Shheil, killing one person – the first fatality since the protests began last month, according to Syrian state TV and the DeirEzzor24 activist collective, which monitors developments in the province. The protest came after an overnight raid in the village by the U.S.-led coalition and the Kurdish force killed six people, according to DeirEzzor24 and the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitoring group. The Observatory said two people, one of them an IS member, were arrested. An SDF official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media, said the protesters so far are a small percentage of Deir el-Zour residents. But the demonstration benefit the Syrian government, its Iranian backers and Turkey, and undermine “our victory against Daesh,” he said, using an Arabic acronym for IS. Several rounds of talks between the SDF and local officials have so far failed to make progress, leading to concerns the protests could transform into an all-out uprising against the predominantly Kurdish force, founded in 2015 to fight IS and armed by the U.S. IS sleeper cells have intensified attacks in recent weeks. Syrian President Bashar Assad’s troops, based along the west bank of the Euphrates River that cuts through Deir el-Zour, have vowed to reassert control over Kurdish-held areas in northern Syria. And Turkey, which considers the force to be a terrorist organization, has also set its sights on the region. The SDF controls nearly a third of Syria, but unlike the provinces of Raqqa and Hassakeh in the north that have large Kurdish populations, Deir el-Zour in the east is almost purely Arab, leading to ethnic tensions between the local population and the Kurdish force. Two years after entering the province in their push against IS, the SDF appears to have failed to win the hearts and minds in the region, which suffers from a lack of services, rising crime, fuel shortages and anger over what they see as growing Kurdish influence. Although the SDF is a mixed force consisting of Kurds, Arabs and Christian fighters, its backbone is the Kurdish People’s Protection Units, or YPG. Some SDF officials see what’s happening in eastern Syria as riots backed by Assad’s government with the aim of hurting the SDF and its American backers. Until Thursday’s fatal shooting, the over two weeks of protests by the residents in more than a dozen towns and villages in Deir el-Zour have been mostly peaceful as the protesters closed major roads and burned tires to prevent SDF tanker trucks from taking crude to Kurdish-held areas in the country’s north. Areas liberated from IS suffer fuel shortages and IS sleeper cells are launching a guerrilla campaign to avenge their defeat two months ago when the SDF captured the village of Baghouz, marking the end of the extremists’ self-declared caliphate. Some of the protesters believe that Kurdish fighters sell oil to Assad’s loyalists amid severe fuel shortages in government-held parts of the country, aggravated by U.S. sanctions on Syria and its main backer, Iran. Since SDF began capturing parts of Deir el-Zour in 2017, residents have expressed anger at what they say has been forced recruitment of Arab residents into the SDF, as well as the detention of many on suspicion of links to IS. “People are fed up with the SDF,” said Omar Abu Laila, a Europe-based activist from Deir el-Zour who runs a group that monitors developments in the province. “They are robbing the wealth of the people in the region.” The protests took a turn for the worse on April 24, when according to Deir el-Zour activists, the U.S.-led coalition and SDF fighters stormed a house in the village of Daman and killed six people, including two women and a child. They said the raid targeted a man called Farhan al-Sarhan, whom the SDF says is linked to IS, a charge that activists deny. A day later, protests spread quickly to nearby villages and towns including Tayyaneh, Haseen, Mheimda, Husan, Shannan and Shheil. “No to Kurdish occupation,” read one banner carried by protesters, according to images posted on social media. “The pace of rehabilitation, economic development and provision of essential services has not been sufficient to meet the basic needs of the population,” Bassam Barabandi, a former Syrian diplomat now based in Washington, said of the protests. “As a result, people are feeling very hopeless about their current situation and the future. Theydo not see the regime as an acceptable alternative, and they are looking for the U.S. to act.” Several meetings have been held over the past weeks between SDF officials and Arab dignitaries from Deir el-Zour to try to ease the tension without success, according to Barabandi and Observatory. An Arab man from Deir el-Zour who took part in the talks, said that “the Kurds have been refusing to make any concessions.” He spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern for his safety. He said the SDF is taking away most of the oil it pumps in Deir el-Zour – about 60,000 barrels a day – and leaves hardly anything behind. Arab officials demanded, among other things, the release of SDF-held detainees, stopping the flow of oil from the province, giving Deir el-Zour fighters within the SDF a bigger role, ending compulsory conscription into the SDF and improving electricity and fuel services. Rami Abdurrahman, who heads the Observatory, said chaos in eastern Syria is not a good omen for the SDF. “The regime could be the biggest winner from what is happening,” he said.

"43"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-pope-francis-issues-law-requiring-all-priests-and-nuns-to-report/"|"Nicole Winfield"|"Pope Francis issued a groundbreaking new church law Thursday requiring all Catholic priests and nuns around the world to report clergy sexual abuse and cover-ups by their superiors to church authorities, in a new effort to hold the Catholic hierarchy accountable for failing to protect their flocks. The law provides whistle-blower protections for anyone making a report and requires all dioceses to have a system in place to receive the claims confidentially. And it outlines internal procedures for conducting preliminary investigations when the accused is a bishop, cardinal or religious superior. Abuse victims and their advocates said the law was a step forward, but not enough since it doesn’t require the crimes to be reported to police and essentially tasks discredited bishops who have mishandled abuse for decades with policing their own. It’s the latest effort by Francis to respond to the global sex-abuse and cover-up scandal that has devastated the credibility of the Catholic hierarchy and his own papacy. And it provides a new legal framework for U.S. bishops as they prepare to adopt accountability measures next month to respond to scandal there. “People must know that bishops are at the service of the people,” said Archbishop Charles Scicluna, the Vatican’s long-time sex-crimes prosecutor. “They are not above the law, and if they do wrong, they must be reported.” The decree requires the world’s 415,000 Catholic priests and 660,000 nuns to tell church authorities when they learn or have “well-founded motives to believe” a cleric or sister has engaged in sexual abuse of a minor, sexual misconduct with an adult, possession of child pornography – or that a superior has covered up any of those crimes. It doesn’t require them to report to police, however. The Vatican has long argued that different legal systems make a universal reporting law impossible, and that imposing one could endanger the church in places where Catholics are a persecuted minority. But the procedures do for the first time put into universal law that victims cannot be silenced, that clergy must obey civil reporting requirements where they live and that their obligation to report to the church in no way interferes with that. The global victims group Ending Clergy Abuse, or ECA, said the Vatican shouldn’t hide behind the argument that mandatory reporting to police is a problem in some countries. “The church should establish the law for reporting and justify the exception,” the ECA’s Peter Iseley said. “Instead, they are using the exception as a pretext for not reporting sexual abuse to civil authorities and to keep abuse secret.” If implemented fully, though, the Vatican could well see an avalanche of abuse and cover-up reports. The decree can be applied retroactively, meaning priests and nuns are now required to report even old cases of sexual wrongdoing and cover-ups – and enjoy whistle-blower protections for doing so. Previously such reporting was left to the conscience of individual priests and nuns. Anne Barrett Doyle of BishopAccountability praised some of the provisions but said they weren’t enough, primarily because there were no sanctions envisaged for violations and because the process remained entirely internal. “Bishops watching bishops does not work,” she said. While there are no punitive measures foreseen for non-compliance, bishops and religious superiors could be accused of cover-up or negligence if they fail to implement the provisions or retaliate against priests and nuns who make reports against them. The law defines the crimes that must be reported as: performing sexual acts with a minor or vulnerable person; forcing an adult “by violence or threat or through abuse of authority, to perform or submit to sexual acts”; and the production, possession or distribution of child pornography. Cover-up is defined as “actions or omissions intended to interfere with or avoid” civil or canonical investigations. Cardinal Marc Ouellet, head of the Vatican’s bishops office, said the inclusion of sex crimes involving adults was a clear reference to cases of sexual abuse of nuns and seminarians by their superiors – a scandal that has exploded recently following reports, including by the Associated Press and the Vatican’s own women’s magazine, of sisters being sexually assaulted by priests. The Pope mandated that victims reporting abuse must be welcomed, listened to and supported by the hierarchy, as well as offered spiritual, medical and psychological assistance. The law says victims can’t be forced to keep quiet, even though the investigation itself is still conducted under pontifical secret. And in a novelty, the law requires that if victims request it, they must be told of the outcome of the investigation – again a response to complaints that victims are kept in the dark about how their claims were handled. Victims and their advocates have long complained that bishops and religious superiors have escaped justice for having engaged in sexual misconduct themselves, or failed to protect their flocks from predator priests. Bishops and religious superiors are accountable only to the Pope, and only a handful have ever been sanctioned or removed for sex abuse or cover-up, and usually only after particularly egregious misbehaviour became public. Last summer, the scandal over ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick epitomized the trend: Mr. McCarrick rose to the heights of the Catholic hierarchy even though he had credible allegations of sexual misconduct with adults against him that the Vatican had received. Francis defrocked Mr. McCarrick this year after a U.S. church investigation determined he sexually abused minors as well as adult seminarians. The new procedures call for any claim of sexual misconduct or cover-up against a bishop, religious superior or Eastern Rite patriarch to be reported to the Holy See and the metropolitan bishop, who is a regular diocesan bishop also responsible for a broader geographic area than his dioceses alone. Unless the metropolitan bishop finds the claim “manifestly unfounded,” he must immediately ask permission from the Vatican to open a preliminary investigation and must hear back from Rome within 30 days – a remarkably fast turnaround for the lethargic Holy See. The metropolitan bishop then has an initial 90 days to conduct the investigation, though extensions are possible. The law makes clear he can use lay experts to help, a key provision that is already used in many dioceses. And it recommends that a special fund be set up to pay for the investigations, particularly in poorer parts of the world. Once the investigation is over, the metropolitan sends the results to the Vatican for a decision on how to proceed. The new law requires Vatican offices to share information throughout the process, since an untold number of cases have fallen through the cracks, thanks to the silo-like nature of the Holy See bureaucracy. The procedures published Thursday are likely to form a key legal framework for U.S. bishops when they meet in Baltimore, Md., on June 11-13 to adopt new accountability procedures, though it will certainly force them to scrap their existing proposals and make them conform to the new law. The head of the U.S. conference, Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, said the law was a “blessing” and that the conference was already working on how to implement it. But the law is essentially a variation of a counterproposal to Cardinal DiNardo’s planned measures made last year by Chicago Cardinal Blase Cupich, envisaging using the metropolitan bishop aided by lay experts to investigate bishops. The law takes effect June 1 for an initial three years. Dioceses must establish the reporting system and confirm it is in place to the local Vatican embassy by June 1, 2020.

"45"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-anc-projected-to-win-south-african-election-with-reduced-majority/"|"Geoffrey York"|"South Africa’s former liberation movement, the African National Congress, has fallen to its worst national election result since the end of apartheid in 1994, suffering a sharp decline in votes but surviving with a reduced majority. With two-thirds of votes counted, the ANC had won about 57 per cent in this week’s election, its lowest total ever in a national election, as South Africans rebelled against years of corruption scandals and economic mismanagement. It was an embarrassing result for the party that was once led by Nelson Mandela, the liberation hero who became South Africa’s first democratic president after apartheid. Many people did not even bother to register for this election. The ANC is projected to win only about 10 million votes from the 36 million South African adults who were eligible to vote. ANC takes early lead in South African election as Ramaphosa seeks stronger anti-corruption mandate Despite the setback, the ANC will retain power because the opposition vote is increasingly fragmented and its biggest rival parties have failed to capitalize on the widespread disillusionment with the governing party. Voter turnout fell to its worst-ever level and smaller parties proliferated as South Africans expressed their disenchantment with the ANC and the other main parties. A key question now is whether President Cyril Ramaphosa can use his election victory to quell the factional feuds that have dogged him since he replaced Jacob Zuma in that role last year. Supporters of Mr. Zuma have waged a persistent fightback against Mr. Ramaphosa, damaging his anti-corruption campaign and weakening his authority. The Zuma faction will try to exploit the decline in ANC support, pointing out that Mr. Zuma led the ANC to a stronger victory with 62 per cent of the vote in the last national election, in 2014. But others will cite ANC internal polling that suggested the party would have lost its majority if it hadn’t forced Mr. Zuma to resign last year under a cloud of corruption allegations. The ANC’s elections chief, Fikile Mbalula, told local media on Thursday that the party would have tumbled to 40 per cent in this election if Mr. Ramaphosa had failed to win the party leadership in December of 2017. Some independent analysts agreed. For the ANC under Mr. Ramaphosa, “this is a positive outcome,” said Susan Booysen, a political analyst who has published books on the inner workings of the ANC. “It gives the ANC a second lease on life,” she told The Globe and Mail. “Without Ramaphosa, this wouldn’t have been possible.” Leaders of the Zuma faction will continue to feud with Mr. Ramaphosa’s faction, Ms. Booysen predicted. “I won’t be surprised if they regroup and make another grab for power. They haven’t been subdued and they won’t be deterred. The ANC remains two parties that are very competitive against each other.” Mr. Ramaphosa can also take solace from two other election results. With most votes counted, the ANC is still clinging to a majority in South Africa’s economic heartland, Gauteng province, where some polls had warned that the ANC could lose control. And the national results also showed that the biggest opposition party, the liberal Democratic Alliance, had failed to make any gains in this election. The DA won only about 22 per cent of the vote in this election – similar to its result in the 2014 election. The third-biggest party, the radical left-wing Economic Freedom Fighters party, captured about 10 per cent of the vote in the election, up from 6 per cent in the last election but still below its targets. Rather than switching to the opposition parties, many South Africans did not vote at all. Voter turnout was reported to be about 65 per cent of registered voters – down sharply from 73 per cent five years ago. And even before this election, only about 75 per cent of eligible voters had registered to vote – the lowest percentage since apartheid. Younger people, in particular, have abandoned the system, with only 19 per cent of the youngest eligible voters (18 and 19 years old) registering to vote this time, a much smaller percentage than in previous elections. While the biggest parties failed to make gains, many South Africans opted instead to vote for smaller and newer parties. “There’s a lot of disenchantment, and we see it in the votes going to these strange little unknown parties,” Ms. Booysen said. Analysts say the disillusionment with politics is a sign of growing unhappiness with the slumping economy and the proliferating corruption scandals, coupled with a lack of confidence in the two main opposition parties. Many South Africans see the Democratic Alliance as a white-dominated party, while the EFF is seen as too radical and divisive. South Africa’s economy has repeatedly slipped into recession in recent years, annual growth has remained below 2 per cent for the past several years, and the unemployment rate continues to be stubbornly high. The EFF has called for the seizure of all white-owned farmland to help reduce the persistently high rates of inequality and poverty in South Africa. The ANC has criticized the EFF proposal, but it has supported a plan to amend the constitution to authorize the seizure of land without compensation in some circumstances. Mr. Ramaphosa, a wealthy businessman and former union leader, is more popular than his party. But his supporters are fighting an internal feud with Mr. Zuma’s faction, which has remained heavily influential in the ANC. There have been reports that Mr. Zuma has supported several smaller parties – including a new church-backed party – in a behind-the-scenes attempt to erode the ANC’s margin of victory. Despite Mr. Ramaphosa’s early attempts to clean up the most graft-ridden elements in his party, many voters were angered that the ANC refused to get rid of several cabinet ministers and top officials who have been linked to corruption. They remained on the ANC’s list for parliamentary seats, provoking a storm of criticism in the country.

Television images showed Mr. Temer leaving his home in Sao Paulo and going into the offices of Brazil’s federal police there. On Wednesday, when the arrest warrant was issued, his lawyer decried the decision and said it was an “injustice.” His lawyers had filed an appeal before his arrest that will be heard on Tuesday. Mr. Temer, 78, led Brazil between 2016 and the end of 2018 after the impeachment of left-wing president Dilma Rousseff, under whom he served as vice-president for six years. He was first jailed in March and held in a Rio de Janeiro facility, but was released a few days later. As part of Brazil’s sprawling “Car Wash” anti-corruption probe, prosecutors allege that Mr. Temer led a “criminal organization” that took 1.8-billion reals (approximately $613.61-million) in bribes, including kickbacks that were promised but have yet to be paid. One of the schemes allegedly involved bribes that were from funds diverted from a nuclear power facility operated by a subsidiary of state-run Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA. While those allegations have led to the current arrest warrant, Mr. Temer has been charged six times over all in connection with different corruption investigations. More than 150 politicians and businessmen have been convicted in connection with the Car Wash investigation, including left-wing ex-president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who has been in prison since last year.

He called the council’s “obsessive” focus on Israeli settlements a “farce,” saying settlements aren’t keeping Israel and the Palestinians from negotiating peace, and said the council should instead condemn Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad for recently firing hundreds of rockets into Israel from Gaza. The council should also focus on the Palestinian practice of paying the families of “terrorists” rather than on how the United States could support the Palestinian Authority’s budget, Greenblatt said. The Trump administration has drastically cut its support for the Palestinians to try to spur their return to negotiations. The Palestinians pre-emptively rejected any peace proposal floated by the Trump administration amid concerns it would fall far below their hopes for an independent state in the West Bank, east Jerusalem — which they want as their capital — and Gaza, lands captured by Israel in the 1967 war. Their demand for a two-state solution is supported by the U.N. and almost all of its 193 member-states. Malki told the council that after President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel “in blatant violation of international law, it is not possible to have faith” in the peace plan, which was crafted over two years by a team led by Greenblatt and the president’s senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner. “Every decision the U.S. administration has taken since has simply confirmed its disregard for Palestinian lives, for Palestinian rights” and for the two-state solution, he said. “We cannot afford not to engage with any peace efforts but the U.S. efforts cannot be characterized nor can qualify as peace efforts, unfortunately,” Malki said. “All indicates this far that this is not a peace plan, but rather conditions for surrender — and there is no amount of money can make it acceptable.” Greenblatt and Kushner have been tight-lipped about the peace plan’s contents. Last week, Kushner said the blueprint attempts to ensure security for Israel and provide economic opportunity to improve the lives of Palestinians. The plan won’t be released before the Muslim holy month of Ramadan ends during the first week of June, and perhaps not even then. Greenblatt told the Security Council “the vision for peace that we will soon put forward will be realistic and implementable” and “lay out the core issues of the conflict in enough detail that everyone will be able to imagine what peace could look like.” “This is the right package of compromises for both sides to take in order to leave the past behind and start a new chapter, where there could be tremendous hope and opportunity in the region,” he added. Greenblatt called on council members “to support the parties to get together to get behind this opportunity.” In the meantime, he said, “we will continue to speak the truth even when it is not welcome,” starting with the U.N.’s failure to condemn the “vicious, cynical, unprovoked attack” from Gaza a few days ago “that was intended to terrify, kill and maim Israelis.” Malki, who spoke before Greenblatt, told reporters afterward that the U.S. envoy’s remarks gave him no hope for the U.S. peace plan. “I thought I was listening to an Israeli speaker … rather than an American official,” he said. “It seems that the American position has been totally taken by the Israeli position and right now the U.S. administration has no independent position.” Malki said Greenblatt “attacked the Palestinians and nothing else” and called Israel the only Mideast democracy while forgetting that Israel is the “only occupying power … in the world.” “It’s very clear that his thinking, his mind, is well set to be exclusively anti-Palestinian, anti-peace and anti-logic, and anti-international law,” Malki said.

The demonstrators are pushing for radical change by seeking the departure of senior figures, including politicians and businessmen, who have governed the North African country since independence from France in 1962. “They all go,” read a banner held up by protesters draped in national flags gathered in central Algiers, which has seen a succession of large anti-government marches since Feb. 22. “We will not give up. The battle will continue,” said a 37-year-old school teacher, marching with his wife and two children. The demonstration was peaceful but smaller than those that have shaken Algiers over the past weeks. This is the first protest since the start of the holy month of Ramadan. Thousands of protesters also took to the streets in other cities, including Oran, Tizi Ouzou and Constantine, chanting anti-government slogans, witnesses said. After 20 years in power, President Abdelaziz Bouteflika quit on April 2 under pressure from protesters and the army, but demonstrations have continued, seeking the removal of all officials belonging to the old guard and the introduction of political reforms. Protesters are also demanding the resignation of interim president Abdelkader Bensalah, the head of the upper house who has replaced Mr. Bouteflika for 90 days to oversee a July 4 presidential election. The army, the north African country’s most powerful institution, has sought appeasement by meeting a number of protesters’ demands including launching anti-graft probes against people suspected of misuse of power and public funds. Last week, Mr. Bouteflika’s youngest brother, Said, and two former intelligence chiefs were placed in custody by a military judge over “harming the army’s authority and plotting against state authority.” At least five businessmen, including the country’s richest man, Issad Rebrab, who is active in the food industry and sugar refining, have been detained for alleged involvement in corruption.

"49"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-after-ousting-bashir-sudans-main-protest-group-struggles-to-loosen/"|"Nafisa Eltahir"|"After spearheading the rallies that toppled former President Omar al-Bashir, Sudan’s main protest group is now locked in a standoff with the country’s new military rulers that is testing its clout as a political force. The Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA) gained widespread support during more than four months of protests and it has helped win a string of apparent concessions from the military council that took over from Mr. al-Bashir on April 11. But as the unionists and activists in the SPA try to chart a course to full-fledged democracy, they are coming up against a powerful rival that has shown little sign yet that it is willing to move aside for a civilian-led transition. Frustrated by a lack of progress, the Declaration of Freedom and Change Forces (DFCF), a broad coalition of opposition groups headed by the SPA, called on Wednesday for a campaign of civil disobedience to increase the pressure on the military. “We have all options open from now on,” Ahmed Rabie, an influential SPA member, told Reuters. “If (the council) insists on holding on to power, we are going to consider this a military coup, and we will escalate our tactics, peacefully.” The SPA has said such a campaign would likely focus on mass strikes, which have been successful in previous uprisings in post-independence Sudan. Strikes called by the SPA before Mr. al-Bashir’s fall met with limited success, but workers may be less cowed following his removal. It may also call for a boycott of non-essential goods and public services in a bid to starve the government of tax revenue, and intensify rallies and sit-ins across Sudan. The biggest ongoing sit-in, which began on April 6 outside the Defence Ministry in Khartoum, has become the focal point of the uprising. The Transitional Military Council (TMC) has said it will not use force to end the sit-in. But the SPA could be undermined by manoeuvring due to its lack of political experience. “The politicking is starting. This is a terrain that the professionals association might not be as well-equipped for as it seems,” said Sudanese analyst Magdi el-Gizouli. To try to placate protesters, the TMC replaced its first head after one day, dismissed senior allies of Mr al-Bashir, announced anti-corruption measures and moved to restructure security and intelligence agencies. Mr. al-Bashir, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes in Darfur, is in prison in the capital Khartoum. But while the DFCF wants a transitional body led by civilians to steer a four-year transition, the TMC has indicated that it wants to retain overall control of any joint military and civilian sovereign council. As talks between the two sides have dragged on, the SPA has accused the military leaders of expanding their powers. The TMC has said it is open to more dialogue and that elections could be held after six months if there’s no agreement on an interim government – well ahead of the end of the council’s planned two-year transition. The SPA’s civil disobedience could put pressure on the military council given Sudan’s economic vulnerability. The country is already suffering from spiralling inflation and shortages of cash and basic goods. But its rivals in the TMC have powerful and wealthy backers. The TMC’s leaders, Lieutenant-General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, have ties to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which together promised Sudan US$3-billion to support the central bank and provide fuel, wheat and medicine. Mr. Dagalo, commonly known as Hemedti, controls the feared Rapid Support Forces, which fought in Darfur and are participating in the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. They are also deployed across Khartoum. “This is an army establishment and they don’t want to lose control,” said Sudanese writer and commentator Reem Abbas. “There’s a lot of things at stake: resources, land, immunity for war crimes.” The SPA, by contrast, was formed in 2016 from unofficial parallel trade unions outside the state apparatus representing doctors, lawyers, journalists and other professions. It was campaigning for higher wages when demonstrations against Mr. al. Bashir, triggered by a deepening economic crisis, spread across Sudan from Dec. 19 and propelled the SPA into the role of protest co-ordinator. It has since expanded to include more than 20 unions. The SPA’s non-political image was key to its success in ousting Mr. al-Bashir after three decades in power, said Mr. Rabie, a high school physics teacher from the Haj Yousif neighbourhood on the outskirts of Khartoum. Despite its large following, the SPA says it will not become a political party. It has no leader or strict hierarchy and, until recently, operated largely underground. That could leave a vacuum. Under Mr. al-Bashir, opposition parties’ activities were limited and membership dwindled. Analysts say they still have much work to do to become effective political forces. The opposition also faces a challenge presenting a united front. The DFCF is made up of a wide range of political parties, civil society associations and armed groups from across Sudan and they have already made conflicting statements about their approach to the negotiations. Many protesters believe the SPA shouldn’t be negotiating with the military at all, chanting: “Civilian rule is the decision of the people.” The SPA has sought to reassure them, saying it will act as a guarantor of the revolution and democracy during the transition. “We always work hard to get democracy in this country and then we lose it,” said Mr. Rabie, who was jailed from Jan. 4 until shortly after Mr. al-Bashir’s downfall. “We worked hard to get it, and, God willing, we can protect it.” "|"‘The politicking is starting’: Sudanese protesters struggle to loosen military’s grip"|"2019-05-10T08:05:25-0400"|"Sudan,Sudan protests,Sudanese Professionals Association,Omar al-Bashir,news,world,Declaration of Freedom and Change Forces,spa,sudan,tmc,council,transition,country,khartoum,SPA",

The announcement from the prosecutor’s office in the northeastern city of Tianjin said Mr. Meng had abused his positions, including as a vice-minister of public security and head of the maritime police to “illegally accept cash and property in return for performing favours for others.” “The amounts were especially huge,” the statement said. Earlier, the ruling Communist Party’s disciplinary committee said an investigation found that Mr. Meng abused his power in order to satisfy his family’s “extravagant lifestyle.” Mr. Meng was formally arrested last month after being expelled from public office and the party. While serving at Interpol, Mr. Meng retained his title as a vice-minister of public security. Elected president of the international police organization in 2016, Mr. Meng had his four-year term cut short when he disappeared into custody after travelling to China from the international organization’s headquarters in France at the end of September. Interpol was not informed and was forced to make a formal request to China for information about Mr. Meng’s whereabouts. There are suspicions he had fallen out of political favour with Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has carried out a wide-ranging crackdown on corruption and perceived disloyalty that observers say is calculated to strengthen party control while bringing down potential challengers to his authority. Mr. Meng’s wife, Grace, said Friday that China has failed to provide a shred of evidence against her husband and accused Chinese authorities of creating a “fake case” against him for political reasons. Speaking by phone to the Associated Press, she again demanded that China provide proof that her husband is alive. “For half a year now, no one has seen him, no one has heard his voice,” she said. She has remained in France, where Mr. Meng was stationed for Interpol, with their two young sons.

Hector Olivares and Miguel Marcelo Yadon were shot a day earlier near the country’s congressional building by gunmen in a parked car in a brazen attack that has shocked Argentines. Olivares, who is a representative of La Rioja province in Argentina’s lower house of congress, was being treated for gunshot wounds that pierced his abdomen and affected vital organs. Pablo Rossini, subdirector of Ramos Mejia Hospital, said his condition was critical. “We’re waiting for the right moment to put him through another surgery,” Rossini said. “He’s depending on life support that he’s receiving in intensive care.” Yadon, a co-ordinator who worked in the fiduciary of La Rioja’s federal electric transportation system, died shortly after being shot. Authorities said Friday that they arrested several people, including Juan Jose Navarro in Uruguay with help from Interpol. He is allegedly one of the two gunmen who launched the attack on Olivares and Yadon from the car. “We were able to establish that this was part of a mafia clan that had planned the attack since 5 a.m.,” said Security Minister Patricia Bullrich. The attack took place around 7 a.m. local time. “A case has been resolved,” Bullrich said. “If it hadn’t been resolved, it would mean a profound political crisis because there is a member of the lower house of Congress fighting for his life after suffering an attack from a mafia clan that didn’t hesitate to kill a person for personal issues.” Bullrich said Friday that investigators are still trying to determine a possible motive behind the crime. Authorities also detained Juan Jesus Fernandez as he was en route to the Argentine town of Concepcion de Uruguay, about 300 kilometres (186 miles) northwest of the capital of Buenos Aires. Fernandez is the owner of the car used in the attack. Bullrich said that both Navarro and Fernandez will likely be charged with the shooting. Others were arrested for collaborating with the plan or helping cover-up the crime. Bullrich also said that the attack presumably targeted Yadon for “personal reasons” rather than political ones, and that officials in Argentina and Uruguay are working to expel Navarro from Uruguay so he can face justice in his native country. “What matters is that the two killers who were in the car have been detained,” Bullrich said. Fernandez’s daughter, Estefania Fernandez, and three others whose identities have not been released, were also arrested. Politicians across the political spectrum have condemned the attack. Argentine President Mauricio Macri said in a televised address that authorities would go “until the very last instances to understand what happened and to find the culprits.” Former President Cristina Fernandez, who is widely viewed as a potential challenger to Macri in October elections, also took to Twitter to demand answers. Olivares belongs to the Radical Civic Union party of the ruling government coalition and is part of the transportation committee in the lower house.

"52"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-who-warns-it-may-not-be-possible-to-contain-ebola-in-congo-if-attacks/"|"Krista Larson"|"The World Health Organization warned Friday that it may not be possible to contain Ebola to the two affected provinces in eastern Congo if violent attacks on health teams continue. The ominous statement comes amid escalating violence nine months after the outbreak began, crippling efforts to identify suspected cases in the community and vaccinate those most at risk. Earlier this week, Mai-Mai militia fighters attacked the town of Butembo at the epicentre of the crisis. The update also noted that a burial team had been “violently attacked” after they interred an Ebola victim in the town of Katwa. The corpses of victims are highly contagious, requiring special precautions to ensure the disease is not transmitted at funerals. Nearly five days of Ebola response activities were halted in Butembo and surrounding areas recently because of the insecurity, WHO said. “The ongoing violent attacks sow fear, perpetuate mistrust, and further compound the multitude of challenges already faced by front-line health-care workers,” it said. “Without commitment from all groups to cease these attacks, it is unlikely that this [Ebola] outbreak can remain successfully contained in North Kivu and Ituri provinces.” David Miliband, president of International Rescue Committee, has met with health workers in the regional capital of Goma this week. Some fear it could take another year to get the disease under control, he said. “There is a real concern to make sure it doesn’t spread to Goma,” he said. “And so this is, I think, a more dangerous situation than is widely recognized outside the country.” The outbreak, which has killed 1,074 people, marks the first time that Ebola has struck inside a conflict zone. Eastern Congo has suffered decades of violence perpetrated by warring rebel groups and militias awash in arms. The affected area, though, is also close to Congo’s borders with Uganda and Rwanda, and health officials in both countries have been preparing in case someone sick with Ebola should bring the disease across international borders. WHO and others have previously said that the risk of that happening was low. The difficulties in accessing some of the hardest hit areas in Congo, though, means that health workers are struggling to isolate the sick, and track down and isolate their caregivers and family members. About half of those dying remained in their homes instead of seeking treatment at Ebola health centres, giving the virus an opportunity to spread to those in physical contact with victims. Amid the rising number of cases, WHO said Friday that an advisory group was now recommending that those at high risk of contracting Ebola be given a vaccine dose of 0.5 mL of vaccine instead of 1 mL. The group is proposing that the vaccine be given more widely, including to those living in communities where there have been recent Ebola cases. In addition to the risks posed by militias there also has been widespread community mistrust in eastern Congo, a by-product of years of conflict and grievances with the government. WHO said it was aiming to have the of majority vaccine teams comprised of local health workers by the end of the month in an effort to reduce tensions.

"53"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-un-clinches-deal-to-stop-plastic-waste-ending-up-in-the-sea/"|"Tom Miles"|"Around 180 countries reached a deal on Friday that aims to sharply reduce the amount of plastic that gets washed into the world’s oceans, the United Nations said. They agreed to amend the Basel Convention to make global trade in plastic waste more transparent and better regulated, while also ensuring that its management is safer for human health and the environment. “I’m proud that this week in Geneva, parties to the Basel Convention have reached agreement on a legally-binding, globally-reaching mechanism for managing plastic waste,” Rolph Payet, executive secretary at UN Environment for the Basel, Rotterdam & Stockholm Conventions, said in a statement. “Pollution from plastic waste, acknowledged as a major environmental problem of global concern, has reached epidemic proportions with an estimated 100 million tonnes of plastic now found in the oceans, 80-90% of which comes from land-based sources,” the statement said. Mr. Payet said the negotiations, which began 11 days ago and brought together 1,400 delegates, had gone much further than anticipated. Officials attributed the progress partly to growing public awareness worldwide – reinforced by documentary films by British naturalist David Attenborough and others – of the dangers of plastic pollution to marine life. Marco Lambertini, director general of environmental charity WWF International, said that for too long wealthy countries had abdicated responsibility for enormous quantities of plastic waste and that the new accord was a highly welcome step toward redressing the imbalance and restoring some accountability. “However, it only goes part of the way. What we – and the planet – need is a comprehensive treaty to tackle the global plastic crisis,” he added. Mr. Payet said the new rules should have a significant impact on ocean pollution and ensure that plastics “do not end up where they should not end up.” Paul Rose, expedition leader for the National Geographic Pristine Seas Expeditions, said he believed changing public opinion worldwide about plastic pollution had played a positive role in the negotiations. “It was those iconic images of the dead albatross chicks on the Pacific Islands with their stomachs open and all recognizable plastic items inside it, and most recently, it’s been when we discovered the nano-particles do cross the blood-brain barrier, and we were able to prove that plastic is in us,” Mr. Rose said. An online petition entitled “Stop dumping plastic in paradise!” has attracted almost a million signatures in the past week. The new rules will take a year to come into force. But Mr.Payet said the signatory countries had said they did not want any delay, adding that the plan was to “hit the ground running.” "|"UN clinches deal to stop plastic waste ending up in the sea"|"2019-05-10T16:03:58-0400"|"UN,united nations,world news,plastic,plastic waste,environment,ocean,waste management,pollution,nature,waste,basel,statement,week,deal", 
"54"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-house-democrat-issues-subpoenas-for-trump-tax-returns-2/"|"Andrew Taylor"|"A top House Democrat on Friday issued subpoenas for six years of U.S. President Donald Trump’s tax returns, giving Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Internal Revenue Service commissioner Charles Rettig a deadline of next Friday to deliver them. Ways and Means Committee chairman Richard Neal of Massachusetts issued the subpoenas days after Mr. Mnuchin refused to comply with demands to turn over Mr. Trump’s returns. Mr. Mnuchin told the panel he wouldn’t provide the President’s tax records because the panel’s request “lacks a legitimate legislative purpose,” as Supreme Court precedent requires. Mr. Neal reminded the two Trump appointees in a Friday letter that federal law states that the IRS “shall furnish” the tax returns of any individual upon the request of the chairmen of Congress’s tax-writing committees and that Ways and Means “has never been denied” a request. The White House and the Democratic-controlled House are waging a multifront battle over investigations into Mr. Trump and the administration has been refusing to comply across the board, refusing to comply with subpoenas for the unredacted report by special counsel Robert Mueller and documents related to the testimony by former White House counsel Donald McGahn. If Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Rettig refuse to comply with the subpoenas, Mr. Neal is likely to file a lawsuit in federal court. He indicated earlier this week that he was leaning toward filing a court case immediately but changed course after meeting with lawyers for the House. Mr. Neal originally demanded access to Mr. Trump’s tax returns in early April. He maintains that the committee is looking into the effectiveness of IRS mandatory audits of tax returns of all sitting presidents, a way to justify his claim that the panel has a potential legislative purpose. Democrats say they are confident in their legal justification and say Mr. Trump is stalling in an attempt to punt the issue past the 2020 election. In rejecting Mr. Neal’s request earlier this week, Mr. Mnuchin said he relied on the advice of the Justice Department. He concluded that the Treasury Department is “not authorized to disclose the requested returns and return information.” Mr. Mnuchin has also said that Mr. Neal’s request would potentially weaponize private tax returns for political purposes. Republicans say Mr. Neal is using the arcane 1924 law that empowers him to obtain any individual’s tax filing to play politics with Mr. Trump. Democrats also want to probe into the President’s business dealings, particularly his business relationships with foreigners and to see who he owes money to. “Your request is merely a means to access and make public the tax returns of a single individual for purely political purposes,” said ranking Ways and Means panel Republican Kevin Brady. “While I do not take this step lightly, I believe this action gives us the best opportunity to succeed and obtain the requested material,” Mr. Neal said in a statement. Mr. Trump has privately made clear he has no intention of turning over the much-coveted records. He is the first president since Watergate to decline to make his tax returns public, often claiming that he would release them if he was not under audit. “What’s unprecedented is this secretary refusing to comply with our lawful … request. What’s unprecedented is a Justice Department that again sees its role as being bodyguard to the executive and not the rule of law,” said New Jersey Democrat Bill Pascrell. “What’s unprecedented is an entire federal government working in concert to shield a corrupt president from legal accountability.” But the President has told those close to him that the attempt to get his returns was an invasion of his privacy and a further example of what he calls the Democrat-led “witch hunt” – like Mr. Mueller’s Russia probe – meant to damage him. Mr. Trump has repeatedly asked aides about the status of the House request and has not signalled he’s willing to co-operate with Democrats, according to a White House official and two Republicans close to the White House. He has linked the effort to the myriad House probes into his administration and has urged his team to stonewall all requests. He also has inquired about the “loyalty” of the top officials at the IRS, according to one of his advisers. Mr. Trump has long told confidants that he was under audit and therefore could not release his taxes. But in recent weeks, he has added to the argument, telling advisers that the American people elected him once without seeing his taxes and would do so again, according to the three officials, who were not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations and spoke on condition of anonymity.

"55"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-trumps-tariff-hike-on-chinese-goods-takes-effect-friday-putting/"|"Adrian Morrow"|"The United States and China remain locked in one of the largest trade wars in history with no sign of resolution as talks in Washington failed to reach a deal. U.S. President Donald Trump jacked up tariffs on Friday to 25 per cent from 10 per cent on US$200-billion worth of Chinese goods – on top of US$50-billion of products subject to the same levies since last year – in a key fight of his nationalistic economic agenda. China vowed retaliation, even as Vice-Premier Liu He hunkered down with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin for a second straight day in a bid to break the impasse. But there were few concrete signs of progress. “They were constructive discussions. That’s all I can say,” Mr. Mnuchin said as he left Mr. Lighthizer’s office near the White House. In early evening, Mr. Lighthizer announced that he would start working on a plan to extend tariffs even further, to cover all US$539-billion worth of Chinese imports. The gulf separating the two sides appears vast. The United States wants Beijing to change laws on intellectual property, stop obliging American companies to turn over trade secrets and get rid of subsidies to Chinese companies. The United States also wants the right to keep its tariffs in place until it is certain China is complying with the deal, but for China to give up the right to impose tariffs on the United States in retaliation. China had previously made concessions on at least some of these measures, the White House has said, before changing its mind last week and reneging on its promises. This prompted Mr. Trump to order the tariff hike. In a series of tweets on Friday, Mr. Trump made clear that he believes tariffs are good economic policy and not merely a useful negotiating tactic. He also falsely claimed that their cost is paid by China. In fact, U.S. tariffs on China are paid by American companies that import Chinese goods. Often, U.S. importers pass that cost on to American consumers in the form of higher prices. Instances in which Chinese companies compensate American businesses for the cost of the tariffs are believed to be rare. “Talks with China continue in a very congenial manner − there is absolutely no need to rush − as Tariffs are NOW being paid to the United States by China of 25% on 250 Billion Dollars worth of goods & products,” Mr. Trump tweeted. “These massive payments go directly to the Treasury of the U.S.” The President said he planned to use the money from tariffs to buy American agricultural products and give the food to low-income countries. The administration did not release any specific plan for making this happen. The President also spoke Friday with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau about the trade negotiations and “relations with China,” according to a summary released by Mr. Trudeau’s office. Ottawa has been agitating for Washington to pressure China to release two Canadian citizens detained since December in apparent retaliation for police in Vancouver serving an American arrest warrant on Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou. The tariffs cover a vast swath of goods, ranging from auto parts to meat to CD players to sports equipment. The average American family of four will pay US$767 more annually in increased costs because of the tariffs, and the economy will lose 934,000 jobs, according to one estimate by The Trade Partnership, a Washington consulting company. The same study found that covering all Chinese exports with tariffs would raise those numbers to US$2,300 and 2.1 million. After the initial round of tariffs last year, China retaliated with levies on U.S. goods, particularly food. This ensured the fallout from the battle between the world’s two largest economies would be particularly acute across the Trump-voting American heartland. Bret Davis, who farms soybeans in central Ohio, said the trade war has pushed prices down from US$10.38 a bushel last year to $8 now – a loss of $200,000 in revenue for his operation. He’s had to cope by deferring purchases of new equipment, growing still-profitable crops of wheat and corn and relying on savings built up over 40 years of farming. “It’s getting kind of serious now,” Mr. Davis, secretary of the American Soybean Association, said in an interview. “You tighten your belt. It’s a trying time here on the farm.” Tiffany Zarfas Williams, third-generation owner of the Luggage Shop of Lubbock in west Texas, said roughly 85 per cent of the bags and briefcases she sells are made in China. The 10-per-cent tariff increase last year meant a price hike to most goods in her store; sales are already down 8 per cent so far this year. “We’re Americans first and we certainly want to respect our country and we want trade with China to be addressed, and want that to be fair and enforceable … it’s just difficult for a small store owner to have so much of that impact on what we sell and what we do,” she said in a conference call with reporters organized by the National Retail Federation. Trade experts largely agree that China has behaved badly by unfairly competing through flooding global markets with heavily subsidized products and forcing foreign companies to turn over their trade secrets as a condition of doing business. But many argue there are other ways to deal with these problems. Inu Manak, a trade scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute think tank, said one option would be for the United States to sue China at the World Trade Organization. Joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free-trade deal covering 11 countries in east Asia and the Americas meant to counter Chinese influence, would be another idea. Ms. Manak said she could not think of another trade war of this size. “This is a shock-and-awe approach,” she said. “It’s unprecedented. It’s something that’s never been done to this scale.” Jorge Guajardo, a former Mexican ambassador to China, said he agrees with using tariffs to push China into trade concessions. But he said Mr. Trump’s love of tariffs for their own sake, and the fact that he would like to keep them in place even if China makes a deal, gives Beijing little incentive to negotiate. What’s more, Mr. Guajardo said, Mr. Trump had hurt his own case by simultaneously fighting trade wars with Canada, Mexico and the European Union, which remain subject to American steel and aluminium tariffs. “China keeps promising reform, keeps promising it will play by the rules of the game, but it never does. I can’t think of any way to confront China other than this,” Mr. Guajardo said. “The U.S. could accomplish so much if it had brought other countries on board.” A similar thought had occurred to Skip West, owner of Maxsa Innovations in Fairfax Station, Va. Maxsa designs and distributes a suite of electronics manufactured in China, including laser guidance systems for parking cars and heated blankets that plug into car cigarette lighters. When selling goods through large retailers, Mr. West said, he is not allowed to raise prices to match the tariffs, meaning the costs come straight out of Maxsa’s bottom line. Mr. West has long done business in Canada, as well, and said he couldn’t understand why Mr. Trump took aim at the country, along with other free-market democracies, instead of enlisting them as allies in his push against China. “Why did we piss off our trading partners instead of having them as a united front?” "|"U.S.-China trade dispute continues with no sign of resolution "|"2019-05-10T18:22:17-0400"|"donald trump,trade war,china,united states,intellectual property,tariffs,importers,global markets,trade,united,China,cost,cent,United States,goods", 
"56"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-cuba-launches-widespread-rationing-in-face-of-crisis/"|"Andrea Rodriguez Michael Weissenstein"|"The Cuban government announced Friday that it is launching widespread rationing of chicken, eggs, rice, beans, soap and other basic products in the face of a grave economic crisis. Commerce Minister Betsy Díaz Velázquez told the state-run Cuban News Agency that various forms of rationing would be employed in order to deal with shortages of staple foods. She blamed the hardening of the U.S. trade embargo by the Trump administration. Economists give equal or greater blame to a plunge in aid from Venezuela, where the collapse of the state-run oil company has led to a nearly two-thirds cut in shipments of subsidized fuel that Cuba used for power and to earn hard currency on the open market. “We’re calling for calm,” Díaz said, adding that Cubans should feel reassured that at least cooking oil would be in ample supply. “It’s not a product that will be absent from the market in any way.” Cuba imports roughly two thirds of its food at an annual cost of more than $2 billion and brief shortages of individual products have been common for years. In recent months, a growing number of products have started to go missing for days or weeks at a time, and long lines have sprung up within minutes of the appearance of scarce products like chicken or flour. Many shoppers find themselves still standing in line when the products run out, a problem the government has been blaming on “hoarders.” “The country’s going through a tough moment. This is the right response. Without this, there’ll be hoarders. I just got out of work and I was able to buy hot dogs,” said Lazara García, a 56-year-old tobacco-factory worker. At the Havana shopping centre where García bought her hot dogs, cashiers received orders Friday morning to limit powdered milk to four packets per person, sausages to four packs per person and peas to five packets per person. Manuel Ordoñez, 43, who identified himself as a small business owner, said the new measures would do nothing to resolve Cuban’s fundamental problems. “What the country needs to do is produce. Sufficient merchandise is what will lead to shorter lines,” he said. Limited rationing of certain products has already begun in many parts of the country, with stores limiting the number of items like bottles of cooking oil that a single shopper can purchase. The policy announced by Díaz appears to go further and apply the same standards across the country of 11 million people. The Cuban economy crashed with the fall of the Soviet Union and plunged the island into a more than decade-long period of misery and hunger that ended with the arrival of subsidized Venezuelan oil in the early 2000s. The latest shortages and rationing appear to mark the end of a phase of relative prosperity but conditions are nowhere close to the deprivation of what is known as Cuba’s “special period.” Cuba’s highest leaders say that while tough times lie ahead, there will be no return to the worst days of the post-Soviet depression because the island has diversified its economy and built trade ties with countries around the world. Food stores in Cuba are government-run and sell products ranging from highly subsidized to wildly overpriced by global standards. Every Cuban receives a ration book that allows them to buy small quantities of basic goods like rice, beans, eggs and sugar each month for payment equivalent to a few U.S. cents. Cubans with enough money can buy more of those basic goods at “liberated” prices that are still generally below the world average. At the highest of Cuba’s three tiers, brand-name goods from high-quality rice to fancy jams can be purchased for often two to three times the price in their country of origin. Díaz said chicken will now be sold in limited quantities in every type of store — with cheaper chicken limited to 11 pounds per purchase and the more expensive variety capped at two packages per purchase. Low-priced soap, rice, bean, peas and eggs will now only be sold in limited quantities per person and controlled through the national system of ration books, she said. Sales of those products at higher prices do not appear to be affected for the moment. The measures can be expected to have a serious impact on private business owners who often buy cheaper-priced goods at state stores in the absence of access to a wholesale market. Cuba maintains a total monopoly on wholesale commerce, imports and exports, with virtually no access for the country’s small but growing private sector. Díaz provided a grim series of statistics on food production by the state-run sector, which has found itself struggling to find the cash it needs to pay for basic inputs. She said that in March Cuba produced 900,000 fewer eggs than the 5.7 million needed daily to satisfy national demand. That deficit shrank to 600,000 by mid-April, she said. The production of pork, the most-consumed meat in Cuba and a normally affordable staple of most people’s diets, is hundreds of tons below target. Díaz said importing food from U.S. producers had become more complicated under Trump, forcing Cuba to search for products that were more expensive and difficult to import. “Selling limited quantities will lead to equal distribution, so that the greatest number of people can buy the product, and we can avoid hoarding,” she said.

Lederer"|"The final preparatory meeting for next year’s review of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty ended Friday with deep divisions, and U.S. Ambassador Robert Wood said reaching agreement at the 2020 conference “will be an incredibly difficult task.” But he told the closing session of the two-week preparatory conference that “it is a task we cannot abandon.” The NPT is the world’s single most important pact on nuclear arms, credited with preventing their spread to dozens of nations since entering into force in 1970. It has succeeded in doing this via a grand global bargain: Nations without nuclear weapons committed not to acquire them; those with them committed to move toward their elimination; and all endorsed everyone’s right to develop peaceful nuclear energy. Treaty members – every nation but India, Pakistan and North Korea who possess nuclear weapons, and Israel which is believed to be a nuclear power but has never acknowledged it – gather every five years to review how it’s working. They try to agree on new approaches to problems, not by updating the treaty which is difficult, but by trying to adopt a consensus final document calling for steps outside the treaty to advance its goals. Malaysia’s U.N. Ambassador Syed Mohd Hasrin Tengku Hussin, chair of the third preparatory conference, told a news conference Friday that delegates “do not agree on everything but remain committed to full implementation” of the NPT, and talked about “how to accelerate measures to a nuclear-free world.” Citing “significant challenges,” he noted that the meeting took place “at a time of increasing international tension and deteriorating relationships between those countries that possess nuclear weapons” – the U.S., Russia, China, Britain and France. Hussin, who is Malaysia’s ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, also singled out differences between nuclear weapon and non-nuclear weapon states on disarmament. Iranian delegate Bahram Shahaboddin said in a closing statement that non-nuclear weapon states “are completely frustrated by the 50-year lack of progress on nuclear disarmament,” and continuing delaying tactics by the nuclear powers. “We must not allow this to happen again. In 2020, we must say loud and clear enough is enough,” he said, singling out the United States for spending $1.2 trillion on its nuclear arsenal and “brazenly” threatening non-nuclear weapon states with nuclear weapons. Hussin said delegates did agree on the agenda, procedures and president of the review conference – Argentina’s Ambassador to Austria Rafael Grossi – so in 2020 they can concentrate on substance. Delegates to the preparatory conference rejected two sets of recommendations for the review conference so Hussin issued a final document called “reflections of the chair.” It says “there remain many more points of convergence in the views of states parties than there are divergences.” He stressed that “continued geopolitical challenges” underline the need to maintain the NPT as the cornerstone of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. But he said: “There remain differing views on the implementation of the disarmament pillar, and these views need to be reconciled for there to be considered a balance as a whole” with the other pillars on non-proliferation and nuclear energy. Rebecca Johnson, a security analyst and founding president of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons which won the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize, said: “The real questions for 2020 are going to be about the nuclear risks and treaties under threat from a few narcissistic leaders who are pulling out of them in order to keep proliferating and deploying nuclear weapons.” “Their dangerous actions undermine not only the NPT … which we need to protect humanity from nuclear war, but climate catastrophes that threaten security for all of us,” she told AP.

"58"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-hong-kong-reports-african-swine-fever-case-2/"|""|"A case of African swine fever has been detected in a Hong Kong slaughterhouse, prompting the culling of all 6,000 pigs at the facility. Secretary for Food and Health Sophia Chan said in a statement Friday that the incurable virus was found in a single pig imported from a farm in Guangdong province in mainland China, where the months-long outbreak has devastated herds. Pork is China’s staple meat and its price and availability is considered a matter of national concern. Shortfalls in supply have increased demand for pork from producers in the U.S., with whom China is locked in an increasingly acrimonious tariff battle. Chan said the culling was necessary so that “thorough cleansing and also disinfection could be conducted.” Operations at the Sheung Shui Slaughterhouse would be suspended until the disinfection work is completed, she said. “We will enhance the surveillance and also testing of pigs, and currently we collect samples from pigs with ASF symptoms for testing, and in the future we will step up the sampling of other pigs for testing,” Chan said. She said the territory’s fresh pork supply would be reduced in the near future but there would still be a limited supply of live pigs available from another slaughterhouse. Unlike swine flu, African swine fever cannot be transmitted to humans and Chan said well-cooked pork is safe for consumption. Concerns about the spread of Africa swine fever to the U.S. recently led organizers to cancel the World Pork Expo scheduled for June in the state of Iowa. Denmark, meanwhile, has begun erecting a 70-kilometre (43.4-mile) fence along the German border to keep out wild boars in an attempt to prevent the spread of African swine fever, which could jeopardize the country’s valuable pork industry. Russia has also been hit hard by African swine fever and some have speculated the Chinese outbreak may have originated among pigs from that country.

"59"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-yemen-ports-withdrawal-to-start-on-saturday-says-un-houthis-group/"|"Tom Miles"|"Yemen’s Houthi group will on Saturday start to unilaterally redeploy forces out of three key ports, the United Nations and a Houthi spokesman said, a move to pave the way for political negotiations to end Yemen’s four-year war. The statement from the U.N.’s Redeployment Coordination Committee (RCC) said the Houthis would make an “initial unilateral redeployment” between May 11 and May 14 from the ports of Saleef, which is used for grain, and Ras Isa, used for oil, as well as the country’s main port of Hodeidah. The withdrawal would begin on May 11 at 10 a.m. (0700 GMT), the head of the Houthis’ Supreme Revolutionary Committee, Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, said on Twitter on Saturday. The RCC committee, led by Danish Lieutenant General Michael Lollesgaard, head of the U.N. observer team in Hodeidah, drew up the redeployment plans under a pact agreed last December in Stockholm, Sweden, the first major breakthrough in peace efforts to end a war that has killed tens of thousands and pushed Yemen to the brink of famine. At Stockholm, it was hoped the redeployment would happen in January, but its implementation has repeatedly stalled on a lack of trust between the combatants: the Iran-aligned Houthis and a coalition, led by Saudi Arabia, of the internationally recognized Yemeni government and other forces. Al-Houthi on Saturday said his group’s intention to unilaterally redeploy from the ports was a result of the coalition’s refusal to implement the Stockholm Agreement. The U.N. mission will monitor the redeployment, a first step towards concluding the peace agreement, the U.N. statement said, adding that it must be followed by “the committed, transparent and sustained actions of the parties to fully deliver on their obligations”. The redeployment should allow the United Nations to take “a leading role in supporting the Red Sea Ports Corporation in managing the ports” and to enhance U.N. checks on cargoes. The Saudi-backed Yemeni government did not state whether their side would make a reciprocal move. They are also expected to leave positions around the outskirts of Hodeidah in the initial redeployment, before a second phase in which both sides pull back further. The spokesman for the Yemeni government’s delegation to the RCC, Sadiq Dweid, said on Twitter that a Houthi withdrawal is “the first step of the first stage. We support the implementation of the agreement”. Yemen’s Information Minister Moammar al-Eryani criticized the Houthi offer to redeploy on Twitter, calling it “misleading” and unacceptable if it did not allow for “joint monitoring and verification” as stipulated by the December pact. The Sunni Muslim coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates say the Houthis use the ports to smuggle weapons. The Iran-aligned Houthis say the government would try to choke them off if it gained control. Yemeni government representative Dweid said his side would hold the United Nations responsible for implementing the December pact “as agreed in terms of verification, monitoring, and the removal of mines, obstacles and military installations”. Western states, some of which supply arms and intelligence to the coalition, are pressing for an end to the conflict, seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Last month U.N. special envoy Martin Griffiths told Reuters the Saudi-backed government and the Houthi group had formally agreed a first phase of troop redeployments, while discussions were still underway for the second phase. Humanitarian officials have long pleaded with Yemen’s warring sides to spare Hodeidah, a lifeline for the crippled economy, dependent on the World Food Programme’s biggest aid operation to feed more than 10 million people.

The American public recoiled — and the U.S. government imposed sanctions — after the People’s Liberation Army slaughtered hundreds of civilians in the streets of Beijing in June 1989, crushing the Tiananmen Square protests. Ordinary Chinese were outraged 10 years later when the Americans bombed China’s embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, rejecting the U.S. insistence that it was an accident. And tensions crackled when China detained an American Navy flight crew following the midair collision of a U.S. spy plane and a Chinese fighter in 2001. But U.S.-Chinese relations may be testing a new low. “The United States and China are on a collision course,” the Asia Society concluded in an assessment of the two countries’ relations in February. “The foundations of goodwill that took decades to build are rapidly breaking down.” Likewise, Michael Swaine of Carnegie Endowment for International Peace declared in January that “the U.S.-China relationship is confronting its most daunting challenge in the 40 years since the normalization of relations. Current trends portend steadily worsening relations over the long haul.” The world’s two biggest economies are engaged in the bitterest trade war since the 1930s. President Donald Trump more than doubled import taxes on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods Friday — the same day that U.S. and Chinese negotiators ended their 11th round of trade talks without reaching an agreement. After the Chinese left town, the U.S. announced plans to target the $300 billion in Chinese goods that don’t already face tariffs. But the widening divide between Washington and Beijing goes beyond trade. China is engaging in a massive military buildup. It is flexing its maritime muscle, claiming ownership of the South China Sea and disregarding the territorial claims of its neighbours and a 2016 ruling by the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea. It is cracking down on political dissent in its ostensibly autonomous region of Hong Kong. And it is turning up pressure on Taiwan, an island that enjoys de facto political independence but which Beijing views as a renegade province that must one day reunite with the motherland. Under President Xi Jinping, who took office in 2012, the Communist Party has grown increasingly repressive. In the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region in western China, it has detained up to 2 million minority Muslims and forced them to undergo reeducation. Xi himself has overturned a four-decade tradition of collective leadership in Beijing and essentially established himself as president for life. “With the large number of issues we have with China, I wouldn’t rank the trade issues so high,” said David Dollar, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former official at the World Bank and U.S. Treasury. “And I’m an economist.” The developments are a bracing rebuke to the optimists in America who assumed that China’s 2001 entry into the World Trade Organization would lead Beijing to embrace economic and perhaps political openness, that China would become more like world’s industrialized democracies. “Many countries, the U.S. being one of the prime players, gave China pretty much a bye for a number of years during the honeymoon period right after its entrance in the WTO,” said Michael Wessel, a member of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a congressionally appointed watchdog. The financial crisis and ensuing 2007-2009 Great Recession helped change the way the countries viewed themselves and each other. Suddenly, the United States looked less like the world’s invincible lone superpower and more like a deeply divided nation that had to struggle to meet the challenge of the deepest economic downturn in seven decades. China’s response was sharp contrast: It quickly enacted a massive stimulus campaign that super-charged economic growth and helped pull the entire world economy out of the ditch. Newly confident, China began to expand its ambitions. After Xi took office, Beijing announced an initiative called Made in China 2025 designed to make Chinese companies world leaders in advanced fields like robotics and artificial intelligence. But the U.S. says China is trying to meet its aspirations by cheating — stealing trade secrets, forcing foreign companies to hand over technology, subsidizing its own firms and burying in red tape foreign competitors that want to compete in the Chinese market. Those allegations are at the heart of the yearlong trade dispute that has rattled financial markets and cast a cloud over the prospects for world economic growth. In the ongoing trade talks, the U.S. is insisting that China change its ways and agree to let the United States check and enforce compliance. Andrew Nathan, a China specialist at Columbia University, said the Chinese would be perfectly willing to buy more American products and put a dent in America’s trade deficit with China, a record $379 billion last year. But abandoning their grander economic vision is another matter. China’s chief envoy to this week’s talks, Vice Premier Liu He, told reporters before leaving Washington that “we will make no concessions on matters of principle.” Chinese state TV quoted Liu as saying there was consensus in many areas and the differences were “crucial ones.” But he also said he believed the two countries would manage to co-operate for the sake of all. “For the Chinese, the bottom line is, they can accept no effective limitation on their race to the technological summit,” Nathan said. “If you want them to bury the Made in China 2025 program, they will never stop that program, but they can stop talking about it. If you want them to stop the PLA from industrial espionage, they can make the PLA do it more secretly. ... If you want them to stop ‘coerced technology transfer,’ they can change the language of the relevant rules so that the same thing happens in a less blatant manner.” The two countries have very different views of the sources of their troubles. “Many American opinion makers are starting to see China as a rising power seeking to unfairly undercut America’s economic prosperity, threaten its security, and challenge its values,” the Asia Society declared, “while their Chinese counterparts are starting to see the United States as a declining power seeking to prolong its dominance by unfairly containing China’s rise.” "|"U.S.-China relations reaching new lows as trade war escalates"|"2019-05-10T22:34:42-0400"|"U.S.,china,trade,tarrifs,world news,business,U.S. business,international business,donald trump,liu he,United States,world,China,beijing,united",

The three of them will work until 4 p.m., earning a total of $14.27 for their labours, while the rest of the family – four other children, all younger – stay at home. Ms. Taiyeba, 35, lost her husband in 2017, in the murderous violence in Myanmar that killed thousands of Rohingya, a largely Muslim group treated as invaders in the country they considered home, and drove many more to seek refuge in next-door Bangladesh. The approximately 910,000 Rohingya in Bangladesh camps now form the most concentrated population of refugees anywhere on Earth. But Ms. Taiyeba lasted only a few months in the crowded camps and their hilly warrens of narrow pathways where her children sometimes got lost, and where many Rohingya survive on aid rations of lentils, rice and oil. When her children began begging for something better to eat, she gathered them up and left, sneaking past the military check stops meant to keep people such as them inside. “I was not able to feed them there,” she says. The family now lives in nearby Cox’s Bazar, a busy seaside town roughly 40 kilometres northwest of the camps. It is a hardscrabble life, made doubly so by the fact they have no legal right to be here. Ms. Taiyeba lives with the constant threat that authorities will discover her and toss her back into a camp – there are, officially, 34 of them – with the hundreds of thousands of others who are waiting in hopes they can one day reclaim land and a future in the country where they were born. But it’s a life, in uncertain circumstances, that Ms. Taiyeba has herself chosen. “I don’t want to go back to Myanmar,” she says. “My husband was killed there. If we go back, they will kill us again.” Bangladesh is not yet home. But it has become the place where she wants to stay, a desire that puts her and many others at odds with official rhetoric calling for a speedy Rohingya return to Myanmar – even as the reality in Bangladesh, both inside and outside the camps, points to preparations under way for a lengthy stay here. Among the government officials and foreign agencies that run the Rohingya settlements, few are willing to so much as utter the word “permanent.” The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees insists that the Rohingya camps remain far from stable. “We should not become complacent that the emergency phase is over,” says Steven Corliss, the UNHCR’s country representative in Bangladesh. The best solution, he adds, remains “voluntary repatriation to Myanmar.” Bangladeshi officials, meanwhile, have repeatedly said they intend to send refugees back to Myanmar as soon as possible, and few among those working here – foreign-aid workers, diplomats, local humanitarians – are eager to openly question Bangladeshi policy for fear of contradicting a government that has in many ways rolled out an extraordinary welcome mat for the Rohingya. Government leaders in Dhaka and refugee authorities alike are also loath to send a signal that the Rohingya are here for the foreseeable future. Such a message risks assuring regimes around the world, Myanmar included, that it is possible to evict large numbers of people without consequence. Bangladeshi leaders continue to pursue the “voluntary, safe, dignified, and sustainable repatriation” of Rohingya to their homes – though many of those structures have been reduced to ash. Earlier this week, Myanmar agreed to extend a memorandum of understanding with several UN agencies toward the return of Rohingya, which had been expected to begin as early as 15 months ago. There is little sign of progress. Some observers are now raising the creation of guarded “safe zones” inside Myanmar as an alternative. But there has been little public discussion of solutions such as opening the doors to Rohingya in Bangladesh, a country of 160 million that, numerically at least, seems capable of accommodating their numbers without being overwhelmed. (Although that, too, is hardly an idea without flaws: Dispersing Rohingya throughout Bangladesh risks their cultural extinguishment.) At the same time, aid workers privately worry about the camps themselves becoming a tiny, more populous Gaza Strip, surrounded by high fences for the long-term detention of a people at risk of being tainted by discontent and violence. In the areas surrounding the camps, unease is rising among Bangladeshis who fear that Rohingya are seizing jobs, depressing wage rates and bringing crime, even as the government of Bangladesh is pressing forward plans to move large numbers of Rohingya to an offshore island. Inside the check stops that ring the refugee settlements, meanwhile, a shift is already under way to build for years to come, as workers install the foundations – often in literal terms – for a lengthy stay by Rohingya on the muddy, deforested hills that have become their homes. In some places, technicians are stringing electrical wires to government administration buildings constructed with concrete and glass. Crews are surfacing dozens of kilometres of dirt road with brick and concrete. Children play on metal playgrounds. Aid organizations are designing more robust homes for refugees, starting with treated bamboo that doesn’t rot and require replacement every year, with an eye toward installing sturdier concrete corner posts at a cost of roughly $1,300 a home. With some 210,000 homes in the camps, the potential cost is enormous. (The budget for operating the camps this year alone is estimated at US$920-million.) But “there’s been a change in thinking to use more concrete and brick,” says Peter Guest, emergency co-ordinator for the Rohingya Refugee Response that the World Food Programme is administering in Cox’s Bazar. “Last year, it was all sandbags and bamboo. Nowadays, there’s a degree of permanence.” Planners, he says, need to “start thinking like it’s a city.” The tension in how best to reckon for the future resides partly in the complicated administration of the Rohingya refugees, a group whose care is largely funded by foreign countries – Canada included, with more than $68-million in contributions to date – and administered by international organizations. But the camps, on Bangladeshi soil, fall under the governance of a developing country whose own domestic difficulties are not inconsequential. Dhaka sets the rules, and they are strict: Rohingya, whom the government here formally refers to as “Forcibly Displaced Myanmar Nationals,”cannot work. They cannot open bank accounts. They cannot leave camp. Children cannot study in the Bengali language. Adults, according to the strictest readings of the rules, should not even possess a cellphone in camp. Beneath the restrictions lies logic. Rohingya refugees are not Bangladeshis and, government officials say, they should not begin the process of integrating into local society. They are visitors, not residents – temporary guests who, the laws demand, must be prepared to return home. But on the fringes of many of the camp roads today, the grim black and white of the law has given way to the exuberant colour of lively bazaars, where shoppers can buy everything from Bluetooth speakers to live chickens. Near the back of one alley lined with shops, Shorif Hossain, 42, keeps watch over a small department store’s worth of neatly displayed goods. He has for sale wedding dresses, scarves, Mercedes Mandalay Classic Slippers, men’s pinstriped formal shirts, soccer jerseys, scented coconut oil, golden bangles, antiseptic cream and German rubberized liquid-fluid ink pens. Mr. Hossain has been selling almost since the day he and his family arrived in Bangladesh toting $400 in clothing they brought with them as they fled Myanmar, where they had also run a shop. But “at first there was no concrete, no decorations. It was bamboo and tarpaulin,” Mr. Hossain says. In February, he opened a new shop, complete with a tin roof and cleanly swept concrete floor. The renovation set him back nearly $2,000, a considerable sum in a country where $8 is considered a decent daily wage – and even more remarkable given his location in a refugee camp where wage-earning labour is scarce. But as a businessman, he had little choice. “If the store doesn’t look nice, customers won’t come. It needs to be beautiful,” says Mr. Hossain, who runs the shop with his son Abul Mustafa, 19. The advent of choosy buyers is just one sign of changing circumstances in the camps, which are surrounded by military check stops designed to ensure that refugees don’t filter out and take work in surrounding communities. An increasingly sophisticated economy has emerged, fuelled partly by the resale of food rations and cash paid to labourers who work for international organizations attempting to guide some refugees toward self-sufficiency. Those who can are cobbling together lives of their own. Women such as Fatima Khatu, 64, have been provided training – and seeds – to grow gardens. Hers sprouts calabash, spinach, carrot and red amaranth in a tiny vegetable oasis at the foot of a hill crowded with makeshift homes. It’s enough that they can provide at least some of their own food needs. The sight of greenery in the cramped quarters of the camp provides a sense of comfort, too, a visual flourish of peace in the midst of penury. “In Myanmar, we feared the military would come and kill us. Here, we can sleep without fear,” she says. Elsewhere, groups of women attend self-reliance training programs funded by the World Food Program, which are teaching sewing, mobile-phone repair, fabric block painting and other skills. So far, 6,000 women have received the training. Planners hope to nearly triple that number by year’s end. Trainees “are gaining this ambition for a better life and a better future,” says Sakheen Akhter, a worker with ActionAid, a Johannesburg-based NGO, who manages a women-friendly space where the courses take place. “They did not get those opportunities in Myanmar, so they are getting opportunities here – which can give them more freedom here.” In Myanmar, authorities barred women such as Nor Halima, 18, from most economic activity. “The military did not allow us to move from one place to another place,” she says. In the camps, however, she has learned block painting, bracelet-making, and tailoring. She now works two to three hours a day sewing clothes for other refugees. Another woman, Khunsoma, 20, has earned enough money selling clothes to buy her own sewing machine, a Chinese-made Butterfly brand, which she has installed in a corner of her shelter, where she lives with her family in a tidy dwelling, where clothes hang from lines and sunlight angles in through gaps in the wall. The only one in her family to make an income, she sits here to make dresses and mend shirts. She benefits, too, from the money other refugees are earning. “A year ago, people had nothing, so they didn’t buy new clothes,” she says. “Now they are getting money from different places.” Some of those places are dozens of kilometres away from the camps themselves, like the rice paddy that covers Abul Boshor’s feet in a thick smear of greenish mud as he pulls weeds early one morning. Mr. Boshor, 35, has six children who live in Hakimpara Camp with his wife, who recently underwent surgery. He now regularly seeks work elsewhere to buy her the medicine she needs and his children the fish whose taste they miss and crave. Refugees are not allowed to leave the camps, and fear grips him every time he does so, sneaking on foot around the check stops. He can sometimes spend days looking for a job, surviving on a few dry biscuits, at pennies a piece. “No rice meals,” he says, “because that costs too much.” The lack of food leaves him weakened, while the distance from family weighs on him. “It was cold yesterday, and looked like it was going to rain. I was so worried about my wife and children,” he says, shedding a tear. “Our house is made of tarp and the wind can damage it.” Still, there is some satisfaction in earning the $8 he will be paid for a day of working dawn until dusk in the paddies. “When I go back to camp with some money, I’ll be able to buy my wife some medicine, and buy fish and vegetables and fruit for my children,” he says. He knows, too, that life could remain like this for some time to come. “We were driven away from Myanmar by the government there,” he says. “We are grateful to Bangladesh for giving us shelter. But I’m not sure when we will go back.” The office of the Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner is not an impressive edifice. Its blue-painted concrete walls stand beside a dusty parking lot. Construction has gouged a deep trench around its front entrance. It’s not much of a welcome mat for visitors. But this building is home to Mohammad Abul Kalam, whose position as commissioner makes him the highest-ranking Bangladeshi official directly in charge of the hundreds of thousands of Rohingya who have become his country’s most prominent visitors. It has also placed him at the crossroads of the debate over the future of the Rohingya, a position whose stature is accentuated by photos hung inside the building of his meetings with leaders from around the world. “We still believe that a solution is achievable,” he says in an interview, a reference to repatriating the Rohingya. “It’s not possible for Bangladesh to continue hosting them for an indefinite period.” He speaks in his office after nightfall on a holiday, a testament to the hours he keeps in managing the crisis. But Mr. Abul Kalam is also keenly attuned to the ongoing violence in Myanmar, where “perhaps the situation has further worsened, in terms of conditions conducive for return or repatriation,” he acknowledges. So, he talks about the myriad options to improve life for the refugees: the proposed $1,300 concrete corner posts; the solar streetlamps already illuminating paths at night; the roads whose surfaces are being hardened. And the classrooms. Children made up more than half of the Rohingya who fled to Bangladesh in late 2017. The need to educate them has brought vexing problems that in many ways crystallize the dilemma of attending to refugees for the long term. Mr. Abul Kalam describes himself as open to helping. Roughly 300,000 children currently receive some sort of education, “so we need to cover another 200,000,” he says. But the government of Bangladesh has barred instruction in Bengali, unwilling to provide the linguistic foundation for new arrivals to remain in the country. Nearly half of the refugee children under 12 receive no schooling at all, and even those receiving schooling typically get only two or three hours a day of basic instruction. It’s not much. But “education is education. They are getting to learn something,” Mr. Abul Kalam says. For Bangladesh, the worry is that “to offer anything more around education goes down the road of integration,” thus ensuring that the Rohingya will “never go home,” says Alex Neve, the secretary-general for Amnesty International Canada, who visited Bangladesh in February. But, he notes, “when you don’t offer any education, you’re taking away hope. You’re just ensuring that a whole generation is going to live with a greater sense of despair. And that goes down the road of insecurity, and child soldiers, and criminal elements.” Last year, UNICEF Bangladesh Representative Edouard Beigbeder warned that “if we don’t make the investment in education now, we face the very real danger of seeing a lost generation of Rohingya children.” In December, a UNICEF survey found that more than 90 per cent of Rohingya aged 4 to 14 were at a learning level of Grade 2 or below. The international pressure has helped to foment a sort of “political game,” says Sydur Mursalin, who leads Rohingya child-protection work for BRAC, the Bangladesh-based group that is the world’s largest non-governmental development organization. While the local government bars discussion of long-term options, those on the ground are acting with an assumption that a short-term solution is unlikely. “I cannot tell if this will be continued for six years, five years, seven years, eight years or two years,” he says. BRAC currently operates 252 child-friendly spaces in the camps where young kids can spend a few hours a day. The organization hopes to double that tally, with the goal of ensuring that every child has access to a safe space, and a place to learn Rohingya songs and rhymes. But Mr. Mursalin’s ability to expand those services is entirely dependent “on government policy,” which for now has drawn a red line around formal education. Muhammad Osman, a Rohingya teacher who is the chairman of Camp 11, has run into that line. The temporary learning centres in the camps at the moment are only for “playing games,” he laments. Mr. Osman’s position, to which he was elected by leaders in his camp, allows him to represent some 32,000 refugees. But decision-making power remains with Bangladeshi authorities – who have said no to his proposals for improving services, including his request to build a private school in his camp. He envisioned a place where children could study a full Burmese-language curriculum until 12th grade. Donors have offered financial support for the idea. When he asked, however, he was told, “It is not allowed.” It’s a response not relegated solely to educational issues, as Bangladeshi authorities attempt to limit any moves that could ease the way for refugees to stay longer-term in the camps. When Mr. Osman asks to build safer homes that can better withstand monsoon rains or a cyclone, he’s told: “That’s not allowed.” When men such as Mr. Boshor, the father of six who labours in the rice fields, ask to work outside the camps: “Not allowed.” “You can’t cross the road, even,” Mr. Osman says. The government authorities and the men in uniform aren’t alone in their concern. One day in February, hundreds of Bangladeshis gathered in an intersection, blocking the main road to the camps for an hours-long demonstration to demand jobs. Amidst the angry gathering, a United Nations car was damaged. Other aid workers turned back. Men surrounded a Globe and Mail reporter until police intervened. “I think it’s clear that this community has been placed under tremendous stress by the number of refugees that have come into this very compressed area,” says Mr. Corliss, the top UNHCR official in the country. Resentment is visceral among the locals who live near the fish-drying area where Ms. Taiyeba works with her daughters, some 40 kilometres from the camps. Rohingya in the camps, with the rations they are supplied, “eat better than us,” says Saleha, 40. “I have a house, but it’s empty inside.” Worse, she says, as she sits in the shade with a group of other Bangladeshi women, none of whom have work for the day, “some of the new arrivals have come to work here. Because of them, we are not getting jobs.” Nearby, Muhammad Ismail, 52, uses a bamboo stick to stir a mat of drying shrimps and bait fish. The presence of so many refugees supported by foreign donors has created a thicket of problems, he says. Because Rohingya eat for free in the camps, he says, they are willing to work for just $4.75 a day, 40-per-cent less than local labourers, a figure confirmed by an employer at the fish-drying area. ”They are getting help from the international community. Then they come here and just take our jobs,” Mr. Ismail says. The government of Bangladesh has what it has presented as a solution to the problem: Move large numbers of Rohingya far from here, to Bhasan Char, a low-lying accumulation of silt in the Bay of Bengal at the mouth of the Meghna River that emerged as an island only in the past few decades. Today, when the waters are low, it’s roughly 64 square kilometres in size and already home to a US$280-million facility – built by a Chinese firm, and managed by the Bangladesh Navy – designed to accommodate those refugees. “Bhasan Char Island is being developed to overcome the constraints and limitations we are faced with here,” says Mr. Abul Kalam, the Bangladeshi commissioner for refugee relief and repatriation. Although Bhasan Char has been developed to house 100,000 Rohingya, it is roughly 2½ times larger than the current area occupied by the camps, Mr. Abul Kalam notes, which means “it can accommodate a larger number” of refugees. Earlier this year, the government of Bangladesh said it planned to begin moving Rohingya to the island by mid-April. Those plans have been delayed until after the May-to-September storm season as aid groups express concern and Rohingya voice opposition – one survey found 98.4-per-cent opposition to the idea, in the camps. Bangladeshi officials, however, continue to advance the plan. Foreign Minister A.K. Abdul Momen has told UN officials that those “creating barriers” to moving people to the island “should be held responsible” for deaths in the current camps, particularly when heavy seasonal rains arrive, threatening landslides. International aid groups have raised numerous questions about the plan: How would people move between the island and the mainland, where they may have relatives still in camps? How could people be kept safe in the event of a cyclone, especially given that large portions of the island appear prone to flooding? Privately, international aid workers call the relocation idea “terrifying.” Publicly, they have demanded more study of the idea. Yanghee Lee, the UN special rapporteur on Myanmar, visited Bhasan Char in January and questioned “whether the island is truly habitable.” Human Rights Watch has called the plan “cruel.” Mr. Abul Kalam sees it otherwise: Moving to Bhasan Char will be entirely voluntary, he says, and “we believe the Rohingya will be volunteering.” “They should be willing to go to the island, because the island will offer them good opportunities for livelihood,” he says, with space to fish, raise crops and tend livestock. For people now living in existing mainland camps, such a plan threatens a tenuous stability that has begun to take hold. Rates of malnourishment have fallen from 19 per cent to 12 per cent, “below the emergency threshold,” according to a February joint report from international organizations. Nearly 90 per cent of refugees are now immunized. Aid groups are expanding an innovative food-distribution program that uses an electronic card to give individual Rohingya a choice of vegetables and spices, rather than only rations of lentils, oil and rice. Children who once drew images of men with guns are now sketching houses and flowers. “That means they were in a traumatized situation, but they are day by day gradually improving,” says Mr. Mursalin, the child-protection worker with the development group BRAC. It is an improving image, far from the horrors that still linger over the recent past in Myanmar, the country that shows no sign of wanting back those who once called it home. Yet for those here, the prospect of spending years in a refugee camp is also little cause for celebration. When he arrived in Bangladesh in late 2017, Mohammad Faisal, now 29, was the embodiment of hope – hyperconnected, smiling, juggling two pairs of chirping phones. His home in Myanmar lay just across the river, which meant he had existing connections in Bangladesh, and access, it seemed, to some money. At a time when toddlers were sleeping in ditches, he was dressed in crisp, clean clothes. His cheery ambition made for a striking contrast with the horrors surrounding him. When he met with a Globe reporter again in May of 2018, he had transformed that ambition into a small digital service shop, with a desk, a computer and a printer. It was located next to a Rohingya-run restaurant, on a perch overlooking a camp entrance. It seemed like good real estate, and Mr. Faisal, who had previously operated a grocery shop in Myanmar, seemed the consummate entrepreneur – warm, canny, uncowed by difficulty. But on a more recent meeting, dressed in a green hoodie that swallowed his thin frame, he struggled to muster a smile, pointing at his side. “Pain,” he said. A doctor had told him he has kidney stones. His mother previously suffered from a litany of health problems, including high blood pressure and diabetes. But “it’s getting worse,” Mr. Faisal said, “because of the camp conditions. There is extreme heat and dust. Everything is dirty.” The circumstances of his own life have worsened, too. His computer business went under when the customers didn’t materialize as expected, leaving him more than $500 in debt and his family reliant upon remittances from relatives in Saudi Arabia and Malaysia. He has not been able to shake the shame of queuing for relief supplies. And although his wife gave birth to a son in the camp, it hasn’t done much to dispel the gloom, a feeling that deepens when he contemplates the possibility of staying here for years more. He now has one more mouth to feed, too. “When I sleep, when I’m at home, all I can think about is my country, what it would be like to be back there,” he says. ”There is no hope for me here.” With reporting by Ro Yassin Abdumonab "|"The accidental city: For scores of Rohingya refugees, a safe camp is hardly a home"|"2019-05-11T08:07:38-0400"|"Rohingya,Myanmar,Bangladesh,refugees,settlement,Cox's Bazar,United Nations,human rights,rohingya,bangladesh,camp,myanmar,home,island,country",

Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party was in the lead, up four percentage points, on 34 per cent while May’s Conservative Party had just 10 per cent, the YouGov poll for the Times newspaper showed. The opposition Labour Party was down five points on 16 per cent. Two parties which support staying in the EU, the Liberal Democrats and the Greens, were on 15 per cent and 11 per cent respectively. The collapse in support for the Conservative Party is piling pressure on May to set a date for her departure. Senior Conservatives want May to set out her plans this week. Nearly three years since the United Kingdom voted 52 per cent to 48 per cent to leave the European Union, there is still no agreement among British politicians about when, how or even if the divorce should take place. “The reason I am back today doing what I am doing is because frankly we’ve been betrayed by our career political class,” Farage told TalkRadio. “If the Brexit Party comes out on top in a couple of weeks time, we must have a place at the negotiating table with the government to help put together our strategy.” Britain was due to have left the European Union on March 29, though May has been unable to get her divorce deal approved by parliament so she has turned to the Labour Party, led by socialist Jeremy Corbyn, in a bid to court his support. Labour’s Brexit pointman, Keir Starmer, told The Guardian newspaper that any cross-party deal lacking a confirmatory referendum would not pass parliament as about 150 Labour lawmakers would oppose such a deal. May, who secured the leadership in the chaos that followed Britain’s 2016 vote to leave the European Union, has promised to step down if lawmakers back the deal she struck with Brussels to leave the bloc. But the prime minister has lost heavily on three attempts to get it through parliament. Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee, which can make or break party leaders, said that May had been asked to give “clarity” about her future at a meeting this week. The new deadline for leaving the EU is Oct. 31 though many Brexit supporters fear that the whole divorce could be derailed. “We are at real risk of sleepwalking into remaining in the EU,” Brexit Secretary Steven Barclay wrote in the Sun newspaper. “That is why I believe that it would be inexcusable for the Government to not use the coming months to continue to prepare for the real risk we leave the EU without a deal.” He later wrote in Twitter that in a choice between a no-deal exit or staying in the EU, he would vote to leave without agreement.

The island nation has ramped up security as fears grow that minority Muslims among its population of 22 million could face sectarian violence after Islamist bombers blew themselves up in four hotels and three churches, killing more than 250 people. “Social media blocked again as a temporary measure to maintain peace in the country,” Nalaka Kaluwewa, director general of the government information department, told Reuters on Monday. On Twitter, Sri Lanka’s leading mobile phone operator Dialog Axiata Plc said it had also received instructions to block the apps Viber, IMO, Snapchat, Instagram and Youtube until further notice. Several dozen people threw stones at mosques and Muslim-owned stores and a man was beaten in the Christian-majority town of Chilaw on the west coast on Sunday in a dispute that started on Facebook, police sources and residents told Reuters. Authorities said they arrested the author of a Facebook post, identified as 38-year-old Abdul Hameed Mohamed Hasmar, whose online comment “1 day u will cry” people said was interpreted as threatening violence. Later on Sunday and early on Monday authorities arrested a group of men in the nearby district of Kurunegala for allegedly attacking Muslim-owned businesses, a police source told Reuters. Military spokesman Sumith Atapattu said people in the mostly Buddhist district then demanded the men’s release. “To control the situation, a police curfew was imposed during the night,” Atapattu added. Several mosques and Muslim homes were damaged in the attack in the district, the Muslim Council of Sri Lanka said, but the precise extent of damage and the number of arrests was not immediately clear. The attacks escalated in the absence of immediate police action, said one resident of the area and a mosque official, who both spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity. “The attack continued for nearly two hours and they attacked one house also in the village. There were hundreds of attackers,” said a resident of the region’s Muslim-majority town of Kiniyama, which is surrounded by Buddhist villages. The main mosque was attacked, a copy of the Koran, the Muslim holy book dragged along the ground and two motorcycles parked nearby were burned, he added. A mosque official in Kiniyama said the attacks were triggered when several people, including some Buddhist monks, demanded a search of a 105-acre (43-hectare) pond near the main mosque. “When Muslims tried to prevent the attack, we were asked by police to go inside,” the official said. Police in the area were not immediately available to comment. Since the bombings, Muslim groups say they have received dozens of complaints about people being harassed. Other communities in the multi-ethnic nation say they fear the government, which failed to act on successive warnings about looming Islamist attacks, has not caught all potential militants. A violent clash between Muslims and Christians erupted a week ago in the west coast city of Negombo, the site of one of the suicide attacks that killed more than 100 people during Easter prayers. The government also imposed a ban on social media after that clash.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a 9.8 per cent increase in measles cases across 23 states since May 10, a resurgence that public health officials have attributed to the spread of misinformation about the measles vaccine. A vocal fringe of U.S. parents oppose the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, believing, contrary to scientific consensus, that it can cause autism. Federal health officials said this outbreak has mostly affected children who have not received the vaccine, which confers immunity to the disease. The 2019 outbreak has not spread to any additional states since last week, when Pennsylvania became the latest state to confirm at least one case. Although the virus was eliminated from the country in 2000, meaning it was no longer continually present year round, outbreaks still happen via travellers coming from countries where measles is still common, the CDC says. This outbreak has escalated since 82 people in 2018 and more than 40 people in 2019 brought measles to the United States from other countries, most frequently Ukraine, Israel and the Philippines, federal officials said.

"65"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-eleven-small-political-parties-in-thailand-support-military-backed/"|"Kaweewit Kaewjinda"|"Eleven small political parties in Thailand announced Monday they will support the military-backed candidate to form the next government, seven weeks after the country’s first general election in five years of army rule. Their announcement came after no single party won an absolute majority in the March 24 polls. The military-backed Palang Pracharath party won 115 seats in the 500-member House of Representatives, while its rival, the Pheu Thai party associated with self-exiled former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, won 136. Palang Pracharath is seen as a proxy for the military, which seized power in a 2014 coup. Coup leader Prayuth Chan-ocha has been prime minister in the military government, and is Palang Pracharath’s candidate to remain in office as head of an elected government. The 11 small parties hold one seat apiece under a controversial “party list” formula applied by the state Election Commission, whose critics accuse it of favouring the military’s side. The third-place Future Forward party with 80 seats supports Pheu Thai. Neither the Democrat nor the Bhumjaithai party, with 52 and 51 seats respectively, has declared whom they will support, but are widely seen as holding the balance of power. Prayuth should easily be able to return to office regardless of the vote in the lower house, because the prime minister will be selected by a joint vote with the appointed Senate, which represents conservative interests and essentially will be chosen by the junta. However, if his rivals control the lower house, Prayuth will have a hard time passing laws and getting a budget approved. The explanation of the party list formula released by the Election Commission before the election, as generally understood, would have denied seats to many of the smaller parties awarded them last Wednesday. The formula that was actually applied benefited them, at the apparent expense of parties allied with Pheu Thai. The election was already controversial before it was held because the military junta had changed the constitution and other laws to create an electoral system that disadvantaged Pheu Thai, which won the last free election in 2011. The elected candidates officially registered Monday as members of Parliament. However, the Election Commission has repeatedly warned that the seat allocations may change anytime in the year after the vote, if winners or their parties are disqualified and new polls must be held. The Future Forward party is seen as being particularly at risk because of its anti-military orientation. The party and its leaders already face several criminal complaints and protests to election authorities that could lead to disqualification.

The board ruled in favour of Erdogan’s party last week, ordering a re-run of the mayoral race on June 23, saying some officials overseeing the election weren’t civil servants as required by law.

Early results suggested Duterte-backed candidates would take most of the 12 Senate seats available, with just one from the opposition slate on the fringes. A Senate majority would lessen the chance of censure moves and lower house probes against Duterte’s government and make it easier to pass controversial legislation, such as restoring capital punishment and changing the constitution to introduce federalism, and possibly extend term limits. The ballot was billed as a referendum on the mercurial president, with the focus on his bid to boost his influence over an upper house vital to him delivering on his reform agenda. The Senate is just as crucial to his opponents, traditionally a check on state power and a bulwark against the kind of political dominance that Duterte is demonstrating. Overall, the massive nationwide ballot will decide 18,000 posts, among them more than 200 mayors and governors, half of the 24-seat Senate, and 245 spots in a lower house expected to again be stacked with Duterte loyalists. However, late into the night, hours after voting ended, only a small fraction of the tally was available due to problems transmitting results. Official results are expected in four to six days. The midterms come at a time when the 74-year-old former mayor is seemingly untouchable, with last year’s spiralling inflation now under control and recent polls showing his Senate candidates scoring highly, and his own public approval rating at a staggering 81 per cent. “It’s not the right environment for the opposition. The opposition could have targeted other candidates instead of making the campaign against President Duterte,” said political analyst Dindo Manhit. “That’s a hard battle. That would’ve been challenging.” Police reported several minor shootings and bombings in notoriously hostile areas on poll day, and said vote-buying was massive, with more than 200 arrests. Technology was a problem, with hundreds of instances of electronic voting machines malfunctioning and trouble with the election commission’s internet servers. His popularity has helped to insulate him from criticism over his deadly war on drugs, his misogynistic jokes and insults at the church, and his indifference towards China’s rapid militarization in the South China Sea. Duterte looks set to consolidate power further in the latter half of his presidency having recruited for his candidates a potent surrogate in his daughter and Davao City mayor, Sara Duterte, in what is being seen as a succession play for the 2022 presidential election. “The president is not on the ballot, neither is mayor Sara. That was a wise move on the part of father and daughter, they were willing to use their brand,” political strategist Malou Tiquia told CNN Philippines.

The extremist leader of the main rebel group in the region also released a video called on every able person to “perform his religious duty” and join the fight. The pro-government Syrian Central Military Media said government forces had captured the villages of Hawash, Jabrieh, Tawbeh, Sheikh Idriss, Jub Suleiman and Hawash hill on the southern edges of Idlib. The villages are near the strategic village of Kfar Nabuda, which Syrian troops entered last week. Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the leader of the al-Qaeda-linked Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, claimed in a video interview with a local activist that government forces have suffered many losses while trying to advance into rebel-held areas over the past few days. Dressed in military uniform and holding an automatic rifle while seated under a tree, he claimed his militant group was gaining more fighters each day. Al-Golani also said insurgents have the right to strike at a Russian base in Syria because “more than 90 per cent of the Russian air strikes are targeting women and children.” Syrian troops have been advancing on the rebels for nearly two weeks under the cover of Syrian and Russian air strikes. In turn, the rebels have been blamed for firing rockets into Russia’s air base in the nearby coastal province of Latakia. Russia joined Syria’s war in 2015, tipping the balance of power in favour for President Bashar Assad’s forces. Opposition activists say Russian warplanes have been bombarding rebel-held areas intensely in recent weeks. Much of Idlib is controlled by HTS, the largest and most powerful group in the area. Most of its fighters belonged to al-Qaeda’s affiliate in Syria, formerly known as the Nusra Front. France, Germany and Britain issued a joint statement calling for an end to the escalation of violence in northwestern Syria between government forces and HTS and “other terrorist groups.” The three European nations said that the presence of extremist groups in Idlib “remains of grave concern,” but said the current Syrian advance “is not about fighting terrorism. It is about pushing forward the ruthless reconquest by the regime.” “We urge all the parties to avoid any military offensive in the region,” the joint statement said. The capture of more territory by Syrian troops comes as part of the latest push by government forces against the rebel-held enclave. So far, dozens have been killed and more than 150,000 have been displaced. Idlib is home to some 3 million people, many of them internally displaced from other parts of the country. Opposition activists also reported government air strikes and shelling of different areas in Idlib. Syrian state media reported that insurgents fired rockets into the Christian government-held town of Suqailabiyah, killing one person and wounding five. The shelling came a day after a rocket attack on the town killed five children and a woman.

"69"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-dutertes-allies-have-big-leads-in-elections-for-philippine-senate/"|"Jim Gomez"|"President Rodrigo Duterte’s allies appeared to have overwhelming leads in elections for the Philippine Senate, one of the opposition’s last bulwarks against a brash populist leader accused of massive human rights violations. Preliminary results comprising 94 per cent of returns from Monday’s midterm elections showed at least eight candidates endorsed by Duterte were leading the races for 12 seats in the 24-member Senate. Official Commission on Election results are expected to be declared in about a week. Those leading include Duterte’s former national police chief Ronald dela Rosa, who enforced the president’s crackdown on illegal drugs, a campaign that’s left thousands of suspects dead and drawn international condemnation. Monday’s vote is seen as a gauge of public support for Duterte, who is midway through the single six-year term Philippine presidents are allowed under the constitution. His deadly anti-drug crackdown, unorthodox leadership style, combative and sexist joke-laden outbursts, and contentious embrace of China have been the hallmarks of his presidency. Duterte’s three children were also expected to win the races for mayor, vice mayor and a congressional seat representing their southern home region of Davao city. The 74-year-old maverick leader first carved a reputation as an extra-tough mayor, who hunted drug addicts and criminals on a Harley Davidson motorcycle and carried the nickname, Duterte Harry, after the gunslinging Clint Eastwood film character. “Undoubtedly, the Duterte magic spelled the difference,” presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo said in a news conference. “The overwhelming majority of the electorate have responded to the call of the president to support those whom he said would help pass laws supportive of his goal to uplift the masses of our people and give them comfortable lives.” Manila-based analyst Ronald Holmes, however, said that except for dela Rosa and Duterte’s long-time aide, Bong Go, who entered politics for the first time without their own established bases of support, other leading administration senatorial contenders earned votes based on their own political track records. The flip side of Duterte’s perceived endorsement strength was the weakness of the opposition ticket and its campaign, said Holmes, who heads Pulse Asia, an independent pollster that predicted the dominance of Duterte’s senatorial bets. Another analyst, Richard Heydarian, said many Filipinos seem more open to authoritarianism due to failures of past liberal leaders from long-established political clans. Such a mindset has helped the family of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos make a political comeback, the latest through the senatorial bid of one of his daughters, Imee Marcos, who was endorsed by Duterte and whose vote tally in the unofficial results indicated a victory. Duterte, who has shown little tolerance for critics specially those who question his anti-drug campaign, aimed for stronger leverage in the traditionally more independent Senate to bolster his legislative agenda. That includes the return of the death penalty, lowering the age for criminal liability below the current 15 years old, and revising the country’s 1987 constitution primarily to allow a shift to a federal form of government, a proposal some critics fear may be a cover to remove term limits. Last year, opposition senators moved to block proposed bills they feared would undermine civil liberties. The handful of incumbent opposition senators whose seats were not up for election could potentially get backing from leading independent aspirants to veto Duterte’s emerging majority in the upper chamber. At least seven senators are needed to block any proposal by Duterte’s camp to revise the country’s constitution, which was passed with anti-dictatorial safeguards in 1987, a year after Marcos was ousted by an army-backed “people power” revolt. “While we expect dissent to continue, we hope that that same be demonstrated with fairness and within the bounds of the law, as well as with deference to the leaders duly chosen by the electorate,” Panelo said. Aside from the drug killings, Duterte’s gutter language and what nationalists say is a policy of appeasement toward China that may undermine Philippine territorial claims in the South China Sea have also been the cause of protests and criticism. Opposition aspirants consider the Senate the last bastion of checks and balances given the solid dominance of Duterte’s loyalists in the lower House of Representatives. Voters in Monday’s elections made their choices for 18,000 congressional and local posts, including 81 governors, 1,634 mayors and more than 13,500 city and town councillors in 81 provinces. The elections were relatively untroubled, despite pockets of violence in southern Mindanao region, which is under martial law as government forces hunt down Islamic State group-linked militants and communist insurgents.

"70"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-pompeo-lavrov-see-hope-for-improved-us-russia-ties/"|"Darya Korsunskaya Andrew Osborn"|"U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Russia on Tuesday that Washington would brook no interference in the 2020 U.S. presidential election and wanted Moscow to take action to show there would be no repeat of its suspected 2016 meddling. President Vladimir Putin, who met Pompeo in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi, pushed back, telling him that Russia never interfered in U.S. elections and that a report by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller, which he praised as being “objective overall,” had found no evidence of collusion with President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign. Relations have long been strained by U.S. intelligence and law enforcement findings – denied by Moscow – that Russia tried to influence the results of the 2016 U.S. presidential election to boost Trump’s chances of winning the White House. Pompeo’s visit followed the publication of the long-awaited report by Mueller into the nature of Russia’s role in that election that spoke of “sweeping and systematic” interference by Moscow but did not establish that members of Trump’s campaign conspired with Russia during the 2016 election. Now that the Mueller report was out of the way, Putin said he hoped ties would start improving. “I’ve formed the impression that your president wants to repair Russia-U.S. ties and contacts and wants to solve issues which are of common interest for us,” Putin told Pompeo. “We’ve said many times that we also want to fully restore our relations. I hope that the necessary conditions for that to happen will now be created.” Visiting Russia for the first time as secretary of state, Pompeo earlier clashed with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on issues from Ukraine to Venezuela. After their meeting, both men said they had been far apart on many issues. “I made clear to Foreign Minister Lavrov … that interference in American elections is unacceptable. If the Russians were engaged in that in 2020, it would put our relationship in an even worse place than it has been,” said Pompeo. “I’d encourage them not to do that. We would not tolerate that.” Both Lavrov and Pompeo said they shared a desire to improve battered ties despite not being able to confirm a suggestion by Trump that he would meet Putin on the sidelines of a meeting of the G20 in Japan next month. Putin would agree to such a meeting if formally asked, a Kremlin aide told reporters. “The United States stands ready to find common ground with Russia as long as the two of us can engage seriously,” Pompeo said. “President Trump has made clear that his expectation is that we will have an improved relationship. This will benefit each of our peoples. And I think that our talks here today were a good step in that direction.” A Kremlin aide said the talks had not yielded any breakthrough but had been held in a businesslike atmosphere. Pompeo told reporters after his talks with Putin that the two sides had a “very productive” conversation on Syria and how to move the political process there forward and were able to “make some truly constructive process points” on Afghanistan. They also discussed North Korea, which both want to see give up its nuclear weapons. “I think we share the same objective and I hope that we can find ways that we can work together,” Pompeo said on North Korea. “He (Putin) understands that the U.S. is going to be in the lead, but I think there are places we can work together.” Pompeo said Trump had made clear he wanted the to try to keep the Russia relationship “on the high ground.” “We have places where we just have very different views,” he said of the U.S.-Russia relationship. “It’s about trying to find solutions, compromises, places where there are overlapping interests. You can make progress in unlocking some of the most difficult problems that are facing us.” As well as the issue of interference in U.S. elections, the two sides clashed over Venezuela, with Lavrov sharply criticizing Washington for trying to undermine President Nicolas Maduro, who Pompeo said must step down in the face of an economic crisis and large-scale protests against his rule. On Ukraine, Pompeo told Lavrov the United States would not recognize Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and would keep in place economic sanctions imposed on Russia over that move. Russia should now work with Ukraine’s new president-elect to bring peace to eastern Ukraine, said Pompeo, adding that he wanted Moscow to free a group of captured Ukrainian sailors. Pompeo said he had also complained to Lavrov about U.S. citizens being detained in Russia, a reference to the case of Paul Whelan, a former Marine accused of espionage, and Michael Calvey, an investor accused of fraud. Both men deny wrongdoing. Lavrov told reporters the two countries continued to disagree about Iran’s nuclear program and the international community’s approach to Tehran, while Pompeo said he had raised U.S. concerns about escalating fighting in Syria’s Idlib.

"71"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-mexico-city-declares-environment-emergency-as-fires-hurt-air-quality/"|"Anthony Esposito Noe Torres"|"Authorities declared an environmental emergency on Tuesday for metropolitan Mexico City, one of the world’s most populous megalopolises, as smoke from nearby wildfires pushed pollution to levels deemed potentially harmful to human health. Environmental authorities advised residents to avoid outdoor activities and exercise and remain indoors with windows and doors shut. It called for especially sensitive groups, including infants, the elderly and sick, to stay at home. The local government said later that the circulation of vehicles would be restricted for most of Wednesday. The Mexican capital is home to nearly 9 million people, with more than 21 million in its metropolitan area. The city’s Environmental Commission of the Megalopolis came under pressure to act after visibility in the city began dropping sharply last week because of ash and smoke in the air. Dry weather has played a role in a spate of fires around the city. Fine particulate matter known as PM2.5 hit 158 micrograms per cubic metre of air at the Nezahualcoyotl measuring station at 5 a.m. The World Health Organization recommends a daily mean air quality guideline below 25. Annual averages above that amount are associated with higher long-term mortality risks. The world’s most polluted capital city, New Delhi, has an annual average of 113.5. Mexico City’s air, once infamously lethal, saw a steady improvement through the late 1990s. In recent years, there have been renewed signs of deterioration. The environmental authority also asked residents and businesses to do their part in helping reduce emissions, such as using cars less, while authorities fight the numerous blazes raging in Mexico City and surrounding states. A local soccer league, Liga MX, announced it would push back the semi-finals of a tournament because of the poor air quality. Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum told local media that she would consider suspending classes for students later in the week.

"72"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-escalating-us-china-trade-war-causing-anxiety-in-americas-heartland/"|"Blake Nicholson"|"When U.S. President Donald Trump began talking about tariffs in 2017, Upper Midwest soybean farmer Jamie Beyer suspected that her crop could become a weapon. Two years later, she and her family are watching the commodity markets on an hourly basis as an escalating trade war between the U.S. and China creates turmoil in rural America. “It’s hard to concentrate on planting when you’re constantly checking your phone to see if another (Trump) tweet has prompted a dip in the market,” said Beyer, of Wheaton, Minnesota. Beyer’s family farms about 3,500 acres in Minnesota and South Dakota and she figures it has lost about $230,000 because of the trade war. These are days of “a little bit of panic” among farmers, she said, and the anxiety is spreading to the agricultural lending industry. One economist said the farm sector might face its greatest downturn in three decades. Soybean prices plunged early this week to a 10-year low after Trump’s decision late last week to impose punitive duties on $200-billion of imports from China and China’s retaliatory tariff hikes Monday on $60-billion of American goods. U.S. officials then listed $300-billion more of Chinese goods for possible tariff hikes, and China on Tuesday vowed to “fight to the finish.” The trade war that began last summer has already hurt farmers, despite $11-billion in relief payments that were doled out last year by the federal government. The personal income of farmers declined by $11.8-billion through the first three months of 2019, according to the U.S. Commerce Department. A similar pace of decline is expected in the coming months, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. “The domestic stress caused by the administration’s trade policy is nowhere more evident than in the agricultural sector,” said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at the consultant RSM. “Should the current policy pathway not be changed, the farm sector is going to experience the greatest downturn since the late 1980s, driven by widespread bankruptcies and consolidation.” During the farm credit crisis of the 1980s, high interest rates and falling land prices led to widespread farm foreclosures. One positive difference now is that land and farm asset values have been holding their own, and “overall, farm balance sheets look pretty good,” said Kent Thiesse, senior vice-president and farm management analyst at MinnStar Bank in Lake Crystal, Minnesota. But working capital is becoming a problem, as the trade war comes after recent poor crop years in some areas. Most farmers were able to get financing to plant a crop this spring, thanks in part to the federal relief payments, but “if there’s no government assistance this year we’re going to be looking at some serious losses by fall,” Thiesse said. Trump said Monday that more aid is planned. U.S. Sen. John Hoeven, a North Dakota Republican who heads the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Committee, put the estimated amount at $15-billion. That could be key to some farmers. In southern Minnesota, for example, soybeans for fall delivery are bringing a price of about $7.50 per bushel, about $2 lower than a year ago and about $1 lower than the break-even price. “A lot of farmers say they’re not getting too excited to go out and plant soybeans because you’re probably guaranteeing yourself a loss when you put them in the ground,” Thiesse said. The trade war is also affecting other crops, such as corn, as well as other industries, such as livestock and steel, from which farm equipment is made. “Everything that I need to run my business or supply my business is going up,” said Randy Richards, who farms near Hope, North Dakota. “What I have to sell is going down.” Bob Metz, a fifth-generation farmer from northeastern South Dakota, said he’s been talking to business owners in small towns and “they are suffering up and down Main Street. The farmers don’t have any extra cash to come to town and buy a TV or a couch or go out to dinner in the evening.” The American Soybean Association said it supports Trump’s overall goals, but that it “cannot support continuing and escalating the use of tariffs to achieve them.” “The soybean market in China took us more than 40 years to build, and as this confrontation continues, it will become increasingly difficult to recover,” said American Soybean Association President Davie Stevens, who farms soybeans in Kentucky. “With depressed prices and unsold stocks expected to double by the 2019 harvest, soybean farmers are not willing to be collateral damage in an endless tariff war.” Soybean prices rose a bit on Tuesday, and Beyer, the Upper Midwest farmer, said “it’s a bit of a roller coaster.” However, “Yesterday I was mad,” she said. “Farm families are doing their job. They’re getting the fields planted where they can, but it just seems like the policy-makers are behind the ball on all this stuff. Announcing the tariffs and not having a plan for American farmers is just not the right way to do things.” "|"Escalating U.S.-China trade war causing anxiety in America’s heartland "|"2019-05-14T15:03:59-0400"|"trade,U.S.-China trade,trade war,farmers,rural America,soy,Donald Trump,tariffs,news,world,china,farm,minnesota,beyer,soybean", 
"73"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-teen-suspects-in-colorado-school-shooting-formally-charged-case/"|"Keith Coffman"|"Two teenagers accused of fatally shooting a classmate and wounding eight others at a Denver-area high school last week were charged with murder and attempted murder on Wednesday. Devon Erickson, 18, and Alec McKinney, 16, are accused of opening fire on fellow students in two classrooms at the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) charter school in Highlands Ranch, Colorado, on May 7. McKinney, who identifies as male, was listed on the court docket as Maya Elizabeth McKinney. Douglas County District Judge Theresa Slade has put the charges along with the entire case file under seal, banning the public from seeing it. Both teenagers were each facing a range of charges including first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, arson and theft. McKinney was charged as an adult, prosecutors said. Both Erickson and McKinney were being held without bond. Denver’s ABC affiliate television station has reported that the two pistols used in the attack were stolen from the home of Erickson, whose parents had purchased the guns legally. The Douglas County Sheriff’s Office declined to comment. Kendrick Castillo, 18, was shot dead three days before graduation, when he and two other students charged the shooters in an effort to disarm them, authorities said. Castillo, a robotics enthusiast and aspiring engineer, was remembered as a compassionate, bright young man during a memorial service on Wednesday at a church in Highlands Ranch. “If I had to describe him a certain way, the first it would be love, the love for anybody that he met,” his father John Castillo said during the service. “We all really, really love Kendrick, but to carry on his life’s message, we need to be more like him.” The attack occurred less than a month after the 20th anniversary of the Columbine High School massacre in nearby Littleton, in which two students shot 13 people to death before committing suicide. Five months ago, a school district official urged the STEM school’s director to investigate allegations of student bullying and violence by a parent who feared they could lead to the next “Columbine.” The director said an investigation found no evidence to support the allegations. The STEM school had no sworn police officer at the 1,850-student campus, after a dispute with the sheriff’s office over the previous school resource officer’s role ended that relationship last year, the school said last week. Instead, a private security company was hired to patrol the campus that included students from kindergarten through high school. An armed security guard responded to last week’s shooting. ABC News, citing an unnamed law enforcement official, reported last week that the security guard may have mistakenly fired on sheriff’s deputies called to the scene and wounded a student in the chaos. The Douglas County District Attorney’s office said on Wednesday it had turned over the investigation into the security guard’s actions to a special prosecutor from neighbouring El Paso County. A spokeswoman for El Paso County District Attorney Dan May confirmed that they are investigating the incident involving the security guard.

The Houthis began withdrawing from three ports on Saturday, including Hodeidah port – a lifeline for millions of Yemenis threatened by starvation because of the four-year war, as it is the main entry point for food imports and humanitarian aid. A military coalition led by neighbouring Saudi Arabia, which receives weapons from the West, intervened in Yemen in March 2015 after the Iran-aligned Houthis ousted President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi’s government from the capital Sanaa. The war is seen as proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The Houthis and coalition forces both reported renewed clashes in Hodeidah on Wednesday, a day after the Houthis claimed responsibility for a drone attack that Saudi Arabia said had hit two of its oil pumping stations. The Saudi-led coalition will “retaliate hard” for any Houthi attacks on coalition targets but remains committed to a Hodeidah peace deal, said a senior official from the United Arab Emirates, which is part of the coalition. Lieutenant-|General Michael Lollesgaard, who heads a United Nations monitoring mission in Hodeidah, said that while there had been an increase in violations of the ceasefire on Wednesday, “it is not an alarming number … I think the number that we have now is pretty much what we saw in some of the days before Ramadan.” The Yemen government and the Houthis met in the Swedish capital Stockholm in December and agreed to a ceasefire and troop withdrawal deal for Hodeidah. Under phase one of the deal, the Houthis withdrew from the ports of Hodeidah, Saleef and Ras Isa. This is due to be met by a retreat of Saudi-led coalition forces from the eastern outskirts of Hodeidah, facilitating humanitarian access to grain stores at the Red Sea Mills. However, Lollesgaard said on Wednesday that a phase one withdrawal by government and coalition forces would not take place until the warring parties have worked out details for a broader phase two redeployment around Hodeidah and agreed on local forces to secure the area. “We need to finalize phase two and the question of the local security forces before we start the full implementation of phase one,” Lollesgaard told reporters at the UN in New York via video. “We will never get a perfect plan for phase two … both parties need to compromise,” he said. “The same goes for the local security forces (deal). We could be done in two weeks, but it can also take months if there is no willingness.” The UN Security Council was briefed on the situation in Yemen earlier on Wednesday. Acting U.S. ambassador to the UN Jonathan Cohen called on all parties to negotiate in good faith to reach a deal on local security forces, exercise restraint and enable the UNefforts on the ground, particularly by granting entry to the country for UN monitors. “Obstruction of the UN process cannot be tolerated. For months apparent breakthroughs have happened just in time for Security Council briefings, then progress stalls,” he said. “Council members must consider how to hold parties responsible if they don’t implement the Stockholm agreement.” Lollesgaard said there were 15-18 UN monitors on the ground in Hodeidah, but that another 30 monitors were still waiting for the Houthis to grant them a visa. Tens of thousands of people have been killed during the conflict in Yemen, many of them civilians, and aid agencies say the humanitarian crisis is the worst in the world.

Joshua Wong, 22, was sentenced to three months in jail in January last year for disobeying a court order and not leaving a protest zone during the rallies that blocked major roads in the Chinese-ruled city for nearly three months. The Court of Appeal upheld the conviction but reduced his jail sentence to two months, citing his young age as a reason. He had earlier served six days before being released pending the appeal. Wong, then just 17, was at the forefront of the broad civil disobedience movement that presented China’s Communist Party rulers in Beijing with one of their biggest political challenges in decades, accused by many of interference in Hong Kong’s affairs. “It is an affront to the court and must be met with a deterrent sentence,” the three judges said in a written summary. “Any suggestion that he is punished because of his status or notoriety as a committed social activist or any other reason, whatever it might be, is entirely baseless and misconceived.” As guards led Wong away, he shouted: “Everyone keep going!” Dozens of supporters in the public gallery cheered back in response. Dozens more had gathered outside the court building, some waving yellow umbrellas – the symbol of the 2014 protests. Both Wong and his supporters also called for the scrapping of Hong Kong government proposals to remove long-standing blocks on extraditing wanted suspects from Hong Kong to countries with which the city has no extradition agreements – including mainland China. “Even though they can lock up our bodies, they can’t lock up our minds,” Wong said as he entered court to hear the verdict. Britain returned Hong Kong to Chinese rule in 1997 with a guarantee of wide-ranging freedoms, including an independent judiciary and freedom of speech, but critics accuse Beijing of increasing pressure on the freewheeling global financial hub. Wong’s sentence comes as concerns widen over the extradition amendments, uniting some opposition, business and legal groups as well as Western governments. More street protests are expected in coming weeks, with some seeing the extradition plans as the latest sign of Beijing’s interference. China’s main representative “Liaison Office” in Hong Kong said in a statement on Wednesday that the extradition law was urgently needed and had a sound legal foundation. In a related case in February last year, Hong Kong’s highest court freed Wong and two other leaders in a stark reversal of an earlier jail sentence, but warned against future acts of dissent.

Ternera was a long-time leader of a group estimated to have killed more than 850 people during a 50-year guerrilla campaign aimed at creating a Basque state in northern Spain and southwest France. He announced its dissolution in 2018. Spain wants to try Ternera over accusations that he ordered the bombing of a Civil Guard barracks in the city of Zaragoza in 1987 that killed 11 people including six children. The 69-year old was arrested in the French Alps on a separate warrant from a Paris court that sentenced him in absentia in 2017 to eight years in prison for membership of a terrorist group, a French judicial source said. He had been on the run since 2002 when, while he was serving as a lawmaker in the Basque regional parliament, Spain’s supreme court issued an international arrest warrant against him over the 1987 attack. The Association of the Basque Country Victims of Terrorism said it wanted Ternera to be tried for all his alleged crimes. “Today we start on a path to dignity,” Covite president Consuelo Ordonez tweeted. Pilar Vallarin, who lost a brother and niece in the Zaragoza bombing, told Basque Radio SER Euskadi: “We’ve lived for 31 years knowing that this guy is free and at ease.” Spain’s acting interior minister, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, said France should allow Spain to try Ternera, whose real name is Jose Antonio Urrutikoetxea, before he served his French sentence. He also said that, as a Spanish citizen, Ternera could ask to serve his sentence in Spain. Ternera was arrested in a joint Franco-Spanish operation in the town of Sallanches and, after asking for a doctor, was taken to hospital, a source in the French prosecutor’s office said. The Spanish news site El Pais said he had been on his way to receive cancer treatment when he was detained. French media said it was likely Ternera would be taken to appear before a judge in the nearby town of Bonneville. A Reuters photographer saw a man, cuffed and hooded, being led out of the courthouse by plain-clothed police wearing balaclavas, to be driven away in an unmarked police car under escort. Spain’s Interior Ministry said Ternera had been living nearby in Saint-Gervais-les-Bains, close to France’s border with Italy and Switzerland. “Franco-Spanish co-operation has once again demonstrated its effectiveness,” Spain’s acting prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, said in a statement. ETA (Euskadi Ta Askatasuna, or Basque Country and Freedom) declared a ceasefire in 2011 and handed over weapons in April 2017, bringing Western Europe’s last major armed insurgency to a close. Ternera announced a year ago that it had dismantled all its structures.

"77"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-former-british-foreign-minister-boris-johnson-says-he-will-stand-as/"|"Andrew MacAskill"|"Boris Johnson, the face of the campaign for Britain to leave the European Union, said on Thursday he will be standing as a candidate to replace Prime Minister Theresa May as Conservative leader. May will set out a timetable for her departure in early June after the latest attempt to get her Brexit deal approved by parliament, meaning a leadership contest is likely to take place during the summer. “I am going for it, of course, I am going for it,” Johnson told the BBC. “I don’t think that is any particular secret to anybody.” The winner of the leadership contest will automatically become prime minister and will take control of the Brexit process, which has plunged Britain into its worst political crisis since the Second World War. Johnson was widely expected to run for the Conservative leadership in the aftermath of the Brexit vote in 2016 but his campaign collapsed before he announced he was standing when an ally withdrew support amid claims he could not unite the party. Two weeks later he was made foreign minister, but resigned from the cabinet last July in protest at May’s handling of the exit negotiations. Johnson has been one of May’s most outspoken critics over Brexit and supports leaving the EU without a deal, a scenario the government’s own economic forecasts have warned would leave the British economy 8 per cent smaller by 2035. The former Mayor of London was widely expected to run and set out his pitch to the Conservative membership in a speech at the party’s annual conference last October. Betting odds indicate he is the leading candidate to replace May and has a 28 per cent chance of being the next prime minister. If Johnson became prime minister it would cap an eventful career for the man invariably referred to simply as “Boris,” known in Britain and beyond for his clownish persona and dishevelled mop of blond hair. He has a long record of gaffes and scandals. As foreign minister, he compared the French president to a World War Two guard administering punishment beatings and was caught on camera reciting a colonial-era poem in a sacred temple in Myanmar. Several senior Conservatives are expected to enter the contest for the leadership. The international development minister Rory Stewart and former work and pensions minister Esther McVey have announced they will run and leader of the House of Commons Andrea Leadsom has said she is “considering” standing. Other possible contenders include former and current members of the cabinet, including environment minister Michael Gove, the interior minister Sajid Javid and foreign minister Jeremy Hunt.

The global rights group issued a statement quoting its Deputy Middle East and North Africa Director Magdalena Mughrabi as saying: “As the battle for Tripoli unfolds, the warring parties have displayed a shameful disregard for civilian safety and international humanitarian law by carrying out indiscriminate attacks on residential neighbourhoods.” The statement said several densely populated areas in southern Tripoli were attacked with inaccurate weapons between April 13-17. Based on witnesses and satellite images, Amnesty concluded there was no evidence of any military targets in these areas that could justify the attacks. Field Marshal Khalifa Hifter’s self-styled Libyan National Army launched an operation to retake the capital on April 4 and has been locked in heavy fighting in and around the city with militias loosely allied with a UN-supported government based there. Khalifa is aligned with a rival government based in the east. According to The World health organization 443 people have died, 2,110 have been wounded and nearly 60,000 have been displaced by the violence. Amnesty International could not conclusively identify the attackers but most witnesses interviewed by the group’s representatives blamed LNA forces, the statement said. The statement also accused Libyan authorities of subjecting migrants to danger by detaining 500 of them in Tajoura detention centre, in eastern Tripoli, near a warehouse that was targeted by air strikes and which detainees said was used to store weapons. “The images also show many armoured vehicles in the area, suggesting that fighters are using the compound of the detention centre as a military complex,” according to the statement. The statement also quotes two anonymous migrants who claimed they were forced to engage in conflict-related activities such as loading and unloading guns and cleaning heavy machine-guns.

Concerns about possible conflict have flared after the U.S. dispatched warships and bombers to the region to counter an alleged but unspecified threat from Iran. There also have been allegations that four oil tankers were sabotaged Sunday off the coast of the United Arab Emirates, and Iran-aligned rebels in Yemen claimed responsibility for Tuesday’s attack on the Saudi pipeline. The fears have grown out of President Donald Trump’s decision last year to withdraw the U.S. from the 2015 nuclear accord between Iran and world powers and impose wide-reaching sanctions – the latest levied as recently as last week – that have crippled Iran’s economy. Saudi Prince Khalid bin Salman, who is King Salman’s son and the country’s deputy defence minister, tweeted that the drone attack on two Saudi Aramco pumping stations running along the East-West pipeline were “ordered by the regime in Tehran, and carried out by the Houthis” – a reference to the Yemeni rebel group. A state-aligned Saudi newspaper went further, running an editorial calling for “surgical” U.S. strikes on Iran in retaliation. Iran has been accused by the U.S. and the U.N. of supplying ballistic missile technology and arms to the Houthis, which Tehran denies. The front-page editorial in the Arab News, published in English, said it’s “clear that (U.S.) sanctions are not sending the right message” and that “they must be hit hard,” without elaborating on specific targets. It said the Trump administration had already set a precedent with air strikes in Syria, when the government there was suspected of using chemical weapons. Ali Shihabi, who runs the Saudi-leaning Arabia Foundation in Washington, said there’s a sense that if the Iranians can get away with targeting Saudi oil infrastructure, then “the whole security infrastructure in the Gulf will be called into question and security premiums on oil will rise.” He said it would seem that Riyadh would like to co-ordinate with Washington how it responds to Iran, but “eventually what may happen is that just Saudi Arabia and the UAE may have to do something.” “Nobody is going to start a war with them (Iran), but I think they should be defanged and, you know, things like their naval capabilities, things like their missile capabilities should be downgraded at least to make their capacity to inflict such dangerous activity more painful, more costly,” Shihabi said. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who also is defence minister and controls major levers of power in the Sunni kingdom, has not commented publicly on this week’s incidents. In a Saudi TV interview in 2017, he said the kingdom knows it is a main target of Shiite Iran and there is no room for dialogue with Tehran. A top Emirati diplomat said late Wednesday the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis in Yemen would “retaliate hard” for attacks on civilian targets, without elaborating. However, Anwar Gargash also said the UAE is “very committed to de-escalation” after the alleged sabotage of the tankers off the country’s coast. He declined to blame Iran directly, although he repeatedly criticized Tehran. In response to the oil pipeline attack, the coalition said it launched air strikes on Houthi targets in the rebel-held capital, Sanaa, killing at least six people, including four children. At least 40 other people were wounded, according to Yemen’s Health Ministry. Residents of Sanaa scrambled to pull wounded people from the rubble of a building hit by the air strikes. Fawaz Ahmed told The Associated Press he saw three bodies – a man, a woman and a child, all buried together. The coalition, which includes the UAE, has been at war with the Houthis since 2015, carrying out near-daily air strikes. The pipeline attack marked one of the rebels’ deepest and most significant drone strikes inside Saudi territory since the conflict began. Washington already has warned shipping companies that “Iran or its proxies” could be targeting maritime traffic in the Persian Gulf region and said it deployed an aircraft carrier strike group and B-52 bombers there to counter the threat. Last week, U.S. officials said they had detected signs of Iranian preparations for potential attacks on U.S. forces and interests in the Middle East but did not provide any evidence to back up the claims. The U.S. State Department has ordered all non-essential government staff to leave its embassy and consulate in Iraq. Germany and the Netherlands both suspended their military assistance programs in the country in the latest sign of tensions. Iraq is home to powerful pro-Iranian militias, while also hosting more than 5,000 U.S. troops. The U.S. military’s Central Command said its troops were on high alert, without elaborating. European nations have urged the U.S. and Iran to show restraint. Also, a senior British officer in the U.S.-backed coalition fighting the Islamic State group, Maj. Gen. Chris Ghika, said earlier this week that there had been no increased threat from Iranian-backed forces in Iraq and Syria. His comments exposed international skepticism over the U.S. military buildup. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said during a visit to Tokyo that Iran has the right to respond to the “unacceptable” U.S. sanctions, but has exercised “maximum restraint.” Speaking about Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers, Zarif was quoted as also saying: “A multilateral deal cannot be treated unilaterally.” Iran recently said it would resume enriching uranium at higher levels if a new nuclear deal is not reached by July 7. That would potentially bring it closer to being able to develop a nuclear weapon, something Iran insists it has never sought.

The Sanaa strikes targeted nine military sites in and around the city, residents said, with humanitarian agencies reporting a number of casualties. Rubble filled a populated street lined by mud-brick houses, a Reuters journalist on the scene said. A crowd of men lifted the body of a women, wrapped in a white shroud, into an ambulance. Houthi-run Masirah television quoted the Houthi health ministry as saying six civilians, including four children, had been killed and 60 wounded, including two Russian women working in the health sector. Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres said two hospitals it supports in Sanaa took in 48 injured and four dead people as a result of the strikes. Preliminary reports indicated five children were among those killed, the U.N. humanitarian co-ordinator in Yemen said. A coalition statement carried by Saudi-owned Al Arabiya TV, said the Sunni Muslim alliance struck military bases and facilities and weapons storage sites with the aim of “neutralising the ability of the Houthi militia to carry out acts of aggression”. “The sorties achieved its goals with full precision,” the coalition said. It had urged civilians to avoid those targets. A later statement said “the possibility of an accident” had been referred to a body set up by the coalition to investigate claims. One resident reported a strike near a densely-populated district, where flames and clouds of smoke could be seen. A car was half-buried under rubble and twisted metal on a street lined with bystanders. “There was an air strike near us, in the middle of an area packed with residents between Hael and Raqas (streets),” Abdulrazaq Mohammed told Reuters. “The explosion was so strong that stones were flying. This is the first time our house shakes so much.” Sanaa has been held by the Houthi movement since it ousted the internationally recognized government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi from power there in late 2014. The coalition has previously targeted suspected drone and missile storage sites in the city. Saudi Arabia’s deputy defence minister on Thursday accused Iran of ordering Tuesday’s armed drone attack on two oil pumping stations in the kingdom. “The terrorist acts, ordered by the regime in Tehran and carried out by the Houthis, are tightening the noose around the ongoing political efforts,” Prince Khalid bin Salman tweeted. The Houthis said they were responsible for the attack, which did not disrupt oil output or exports. The group denies being a puppet of Tehran or receiving arms from Iran, and says its revolution is against corruption. The head of the Houthis’ Supreme Revolutionary Committee denied that Iran directed the strike and said the movement manufactures its drones locally. Tehran also denies providing arms to the Houthis. “We are not agents for anyone,” Mohammed Ali al-Houthi told Reuters. “We make decisions independently and do not take orders for drones or anything else.” The coalition described the drone attack as a “war crime”. The United Arab Emirates said on Wednesday that the Western-backed coalition, of which it is a main member, would “retaliate hard” for any Houthi attacks on coalition targets. The Sanaa air strikes and renewed fighting in Yemen’s Hodeidah port that breached a U.N.-sponsored truce in the Red Sea city, could complicate peace efforts to end the four-year war that has killed tens of thousands of people, many of them civilians, and pushed the country to the brink of famine. The coalition, which receives arms and intelligence from Western nations, intervened in Yemen in 2015 to try to restore Hadi’s Aden-based government. The warring parties agreed last December at U.N.-sponsored peace talks on a ceasefire and troop withdrawal deal in Hodeidah, a lifeline for millions of Yemenis that became the focus of the war last year. The pact, the first major breakthrough in over four years, stalled for months amid deep suspicion among all parties, but special envoy Martin Griffiths secured some progress when the Houthis started withdrawing from three ports last Saturday. Pro-coalition troops are expected to pull back as well under the deal once the two sides work out details for a broader phase two redeployment in Hodeidah, the main entry point for Yemen’s commercial and aid imports and the Houthis’ key supply line.

The announcement on Friday came as South Korea desperately seeks to keep alive a momentum for inter-Korean engagement, which has tapered off following the collapse of a high-stakes nuclear summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and President Donald Trump in February over mismatched demands in sanctions relief and disarmament. Kim has since aired his displeasure with short-range missile tests apparently aimed at pressuring Washington and Seoul, and declared that the Trump administration has until the end of the year to come up with mutually acceptable terms for a deal to salvage the negotiations. Seoul also said on Friday it will push ahead with plans to provide $8-million worth of humanitarian aid to North Korea through international organizations, a proposal it first made in 2017. While South Korean President Moon Jae-in has expressed hope that aid might help reinvigorate diplomatic activity with Pyongyang, his government has yet to decide on concrete plans amid public concern and frustration over Kim’s weapons tests. Lee Sang-min, spokesman of Seoul’s Unification Ministry, said it plans to discuss with North Korean officials details for the South Korean visits to the factories at the North Korean border town of Kaesong, where the Koreas also operate a liaison office. He said that the ministry decided to allow the visits by 193 businesspeople so that they could examine the manufacturing facilities and other property they left behind in the North. He downplayed speculation that Seoul was trying to build momentum toward reopening the factory park, which provided badly needed cash for the North before its closure in February 2016. “It has been three years since the Kaesong industrial park has closed and the businesspeople have requested visits to the North nine different times since, so the decision is based on protecting the property rights of our citizens,” Lee said. Since the Trump-Kim meeting in February ended with no results, Pyongyang has demanded Seoul break away from Washington to resume operations at the Kaesong factory park as well as South Korean tours to the North’s Diamond Mountain resort. They have all been held back by U.S.-led sanctions against the North.

"82"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-irans-regional-proxies-ensure-it-will-never-fight-alone-2/"|"Zeina Karam"|"In the event of war with the United States, Iran “will not be alone.” That message was delivered by the leader of Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group to a mass rally in Beirut in February marking the 40th anniversary of Iran’s Islamic Revolution. “If America launches war on Iran, it will not be alone in the confrontation, because the fate of our region is tied to the Islamic Republic,” Hassan Nasrallah said. From Lebanon and Syria to Iraq, Yemen, and the Gaza Strip, Tehran has significantly expanded its footprint over the past decade, finding and developing powerful allies in conflict-ravaged countries across the Middle East. Hezbollah is one of the most prominent members of the self-styled “axis of resistance,” armed groups with tens of thousands of Shiite Muslim fighters beholden to Tehran. Iran has used such groups in the past to strike its regional foes, and could mobilize them if the latest tensions with the United States lead to an armed conflict – dramatically expanding the battlefield. Here’s a look at Tehran’s allies in the Mideast: The militia, whose Arabic name translates into “Party of God,” was established by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard during Lebanon’s civil war in the 1980s. Today it is among the most effective armed groups in the region, extending Iran’s influence to Israel’s doorstep. In a paper for the Brookings Institute earlier this year, former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Jeffrey Feltman described the group as revolutionary Iran’s “most successful export” and Tehran’s “multi-purpose tool.” Hezbollah was formed to combat Israel following its invasion of Lebanon in 1982. It waged an 18-year guerrilla war against Israeli forces, eventually forcing them to withdraw from Lebanon in 2000. Six years later, it battled Israel to a bloody stalemate in a month-long war. Today, the group has an arsenal of tens of thousands of rockets and missiles that can reach deep into Israel, as well as thousands of highly disciplined and battle-hardened fighters. Hezbollah has fought alongside government forces in Syria for more than six years, gaining even more battlefield experience and expanding its reach. At home, the group’s power exceeds that of the Lebanese armed forces, and along with its allies has more power than ever in the parliament and government. Despite the rhetoric, Hezbollah says it is not seeking another war with Israel, and it is not likely to join in any regional confrontation – at least not in the early stages – unless provoked. Hezbollah has lost hundreds of fighters in Syria, exacting a heavy toll on the Shiite community from which it draws most of its support. Yemen’s Shiite rebels, known as Houthis, swept down from the north and captured the capital, Sanaa, in 2014. A Saudi-led coalition entered the conflict on the side of the government the following year. The war has since killed tens of thousands of people and generated the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Saudi Arabia views the Houthis as an Iranian proxy, and along with Western nations and U.N. experts has accused Tehran of providing arms to the rebels, including the long-range missiles they have fired into Saudi Arabia. Iran supports the rebels but denies arming them. The Houthis have given up little ground since the coalition entered the war, and have targeted the Saudi capital, Riyadh, with long-range missiles. Earlier this week they claimed a drone attack that shut down a major oil pipeline in Saudi Arabia, which responded with air strikes on Yemen’s rebel-held capital that killed civilians. Iran has trained, financed, and equipped Shiite militias in Iraq that battled U.S. forces in the years after the 2003 invasion and remobilized to battle the Islamic State group a decade later. The groups include Asaib Ahl al-Haq, Kataeb Hezbollah and the Badr Organization, all three led by men with close ties to Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the leader of Iran’s elite Quds Force and the architect of Tehran’s regional strategy. The militias fall under the umbrella of Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Forces, a collection of mostly Shiite militias that were incorporated into the country’s armed forces in 2016. Together they number more than 140,000 fighters, and while they fall under the authority of Iraq’s prime minister, the PMF’s top brass are politically aligned with Iran. U.S. forces and the PMF fought side-by-side against Islamic State militants after Iraq’s parliament invited the U.S. back into the country in 2014. But now that the war is largely concluded, some militia leaders are calling on U.S. troops to leave again, threatening to expel them by force if necessary. This week, the U.S. ordered all non-essential government staff to leave Iraq, amid unspecified threats in the region said to be linked to Iran. Iran has long supported Palestinian militant groups, including Gaza’s Hamas rulers and particularly the smaller Islamic Jihad group. Hamas fell out with Iran after the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings, losing millions of dollars in monthly assistance. The group today is in a severe financial crisis; its employees and public servants in Gaza have not been paid full salaries in years. Tehran is said to have continued its military support to Hamas’ armed wing, but the group appears to get most of its aid from Qatar, making it less likely that it would rally to Tehran’s side in a regional conflict. Islamic Jihad, another Sunni militant group, is seen as much closer to Iran but still not as deeply intertwined as Hezbollah or other groups. Hamas and Islamic Jihad launched hundreds of rockets from Gaza during a bout of fighting with Israel earlier this month. Israel accused Islamic Jihad of triggering the violence, which was the worst since a 2014 war. The movement did not deny the Israeli accusations.

I still cannot understand. I still feel that I’ll wake up,” she said in emotional testimony to a hearing on international press freedom and the dangers of reporting on human rights. Ms. Cengiz was the last person to see Mr. Khashoggi, a U.S. resident and columnist for The Washington Post, before he went into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 to obtain papers for their upcoming marriage. He never left the building. The Saudi journalist, a royal insider who became a critic of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was killed and dismembered inside the consulate by a team of Saudi operatives, provoking international revulsion. “We still don’t know why he was killed. We don’t know where his corpse is,” Ms. Cengiz said. She called for sanctions to punish Saudi Arabia and for Washington to push for the freedom of political prisoners held in the kingdom. U.S. authorities have concluded that responsibility for Mr. Khashoggi’s death went to the highest levels of the Saudi government. Riyadh denies the Crown Prince was involved. Ms. Cengiz said she came to Washington hoping to help provoke a stronger reaction to her fiancée’s death. She said U.S. President Donald Trump invited her to the White House months earlier, but that she had not come then because she was not confident about his response. “I think we choose between two things ... ” Ms. Cengiz told the subcommittee. “We can either go on as if nothing has happened ... or we can act, we can leave aside all interests, international interests and politics, and focus on the values for a better life.” The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In the past, Mr. Trump has resisted imposing consequences such as strong sanctions. Saudi Arabia is considered an important partner in the Middle East and a counterweight to Iran. Calling the United States “a fortress” protecting freedom of thought and human rights, Ms. Cengiz appealed for justice. “I think it is a test for the United States and I believe it is a test that it can and should pass,” she said.

Salles said non-governmental organizations (NGOs) had failed to account for the way they use money disbursed to them from the $1.28 billion fund administered by Brazilian state development bank BNDES. Salles, a climate change skeptic, told reporters he and BNDES had agreed that the governance and rules for awards must be changed to better direct spending. Salles said 82% of the awards that the ministry had inspected were granted without a bidding process and that he was recommending no new funding of projects for now. The Norwegian embassy said it had neither received nor agreed to any proposal to change the management of the fund or the criteria for allocating resources. “Norway is satisfied with the robust governance structure of the Amazon Fund and the significant results that the entities supported by the Fund have achieved in the last 10 years,” it said in a statement. BNDES declined comment. The fund supports Brazil’s environmental agency Ibama in its efforts to go after illegal loggers in the world’s largest rain forest, which scientists see as vital to fight climate change because it absorbs vast amounts of carbon dioxide. At the local community level, the fund helps develop sustainable livelihoods on forest products so they do not need to cut down trees. Members of Brazil’s new right-wing government believe climate change is a leftist conspiracy aimed at hindering economic development and they accuse foreign NGO’s of meddling in its affairs. President Jair Bolsonaro has said he wants to open the Amazon region to commercial agriculture and mining. After he took office in January, his government withdrew its offer to host the 2019 United Nations conference on climate change, maintaining that Brazil’s sovereignty over the Amazon was at stake. Norway has donated $1.2 billion to the fund, and Germany $68 million, with Brazil’s state-run oil company contributing $7.7 million. More than 60% of awards have gone to environmental projects by federal, state and municipal governments, though awards have ground to a halt since Bolsonaro took office. Its annual funding is linked to Brazil’s success in reducing Amazon deforestation in the prior year. Norway has cut its support for the fund in the past when deforestation increased. Announcing a $70 million donation for 2017 in December, the Norwegian government said it was concerned over a new surge in destruction of the Amazon rain forest.

She was 7. The cat, whose actual name was Tardar Sauce and who hailed from Arizona, died after complications arose from a urinary tract infection, her family wrote on Twitter. “Besides being our baby and a cherished member of the family, Grumpy Cat has helped millions of people smile all around the world – even when times were tough,” according to the post. Many cats have had moments of minifame on the internet, but few, if any, have had the reach and staying power of Grumpy Cat. She first rose to prominence six years ago, after her owner posted a photo to Reddit, captioned “Meet grumpy cat.” The sourpuss with the piercing look of contempt quickly became a meme, and placing bold words above and below her frown became a common way for humans to express grumpy thoughts. Perhaps the most famous: “I had fun once. It was awful.” Grumpy Cat’s visage was named the Meme of the Year at the 2013 Webby Awards, beating out “Gangnam Style” and “Harlem Shake.” Many memes come and go, but her owner, Tabatha Bundesen, turned the cat’s face into the centre of a thriving business. Her likeness appeared on nearly 900 items in an official shop, she made a television advertisement for “Honey Nut Cheerios” and she became the official “spokescat” of Friskies, a cat food brand. The cat starred in a Lifetime Christmas movie, “Grumpy Cat’s Worst Christmas Ever,” she was on the cover of New York Magazine and her book hit No. 7 on The New York Times’ advice, how-to and miscellaneous best-seller list. Estimates ranged widely on how much Grumpy Cat was worth, although Ms. Bundesen disputed a 2014 report that the cat had earned her US$100-million. In 2018, Ms. Bundesen won US$710,000 in a copyright infringement suit against a coffee company that made Grumpy Cat Grumppuccino. The cat’s famous scowl was the result of feline dwarfism, her family said, and although she was a mixed breed, her owners were unsure of the specific mix. On the cat’s website, her owners maintain that Grumpy Cat wasn’t grumpy at all. “She is a super cute and cuddly kitty and loves to be held and rubbed,” they wrote.

The decision of the People’s Front party to quit the faction of outgoing President Petro Poroshenko triggers a 30-day period for discussions on forging a new coalition. This would probably prevent Mr. Zelensky from calling an election as it would be too close to the current planned date of the poll in late October. Mr. Zelensky, a comedian with no prior political experience, won the presidency by a landslide last month but his new party has no representation in parliament, making it expedient for him to call a snap poll while his popularity remains high. His ability to work with parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, will be crucial to his ability to meet the expectations of his voters and also pass reforms needed to keep foreign aid flowing. "So the current game in parliament is another testimony to the fact that deputies are indifferent to the people who elected them,” Mr. Zelensky’s press service said in a statement criticizing the move by the People’s Front. “However, we want to remind you that the country needs changes and deep reforms. This is the demand of the Ukrainian people. And for its implementation, a capable parliament is needed.” Parliament has been dominated by an alliance between Mr. Poroshenko’s faction and the People’s Front since they came to power following street protests in 2014 that ousted Ukraine’s previous pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovich. “We declare our withdrawal from the current coalition, the cessation of its activities … and the initiative to form a new coalition with a new agenda,” Maksym Burbak, the People’s Front faction leader, said in the Verkhovna Rada earlier on Friday. Mr. Zelensky won the presidency by appealing to voters fed up with entrenched corruption and low living standards in a country that remains one of Europe’s poorest nearly three decades after it secured independence from the Soviet Union. Mr. Zelensky’s Servant of the People party, named after the TV comedy series in which he played a fictional president, is on course to win the next parliamentary election but fall short of a majority, a survey by the Reiting pollster showed this week. Mr. Zelensky signalled his desire for a snap parliamentary poll when he accused the election commission of deliberately delaying the official announcement of his presidential win and thereby narrowing the legal window for him to dissolve the Verkhovna Rada. However, more recently he has declined to say for sure whether he wanted a snap poll, saying any such announcement would only happen after his inauguration on May 20.

Nearly three years after the United Kingdom voted 52 per cent to 48 per cent in a referendum to leave the EU, it remains unclear how, when or even if it will leave the European club it joined in 1973. The current deadline to leave is Oct. 31. Brexit talks between Ms. May’s Conservative Party and Labour collapsed hours after May agreed on Thursday to set out in early June a timetable for her departure. Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn wrote to Ms. May on Friday informing her that the Brexit talks, which began on April 3, had “gone as far as they can” due to the instability of her government and its refusal to fundamentally shift its position. “We have been unable to bridge important policy gaps between us,” Mr. Corbyn, a socialist who voted against joining the predecessor of the EU in 1975, wrote to Ms. May. “Even more crucially, the increasing weakness and instability of your government means there cannot be confidence in securing whatever might be agreed between us,” Mr. Corbyn said. He said Labour would oppose Ms. May’s deal when it returns to Parliament early next month. He later told reporters there was no chance of getting even part of a Brexit deal ratified by the end of July. The divorce deal, which Ms. May negotiated last year with the EU, has been rejected three times by Parliament. Ms. May will put the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, legislation required to enact the exit deal, to a vote in Parliament in early June. A source in Ms. May’s office said the bill would not be the same thing Parliament had rejected previously and will contain new features to reflect some lawmakers’ concerns. Looking uncomfortable as she delivered a televised message to voters ahead of the European Parliament elections, Ms. May suggested Labour’s internal divisions over a second referendum were to blame for the failure of the talks. The British pound sank to US$1.27, its lowest level since mid-January. Ms. May’s hands have been tied, knowing that to make concessions to Labour would lead to fury in her divided party. Labour has feared any compromises on issues such as workers’ rights would be torn up by Ms. May’s successor. Britain’s labyrinthine crisis over Brexit has stunned allies and foes alike and, with deadlock in London, the world’s fifth largest economy faces an array of options including an exit with a deal to smooth the transition, a no-deal exit, an election or a second referendum. The Brexit impasse is unlikely to be broken soon. After she puts her deal to a vote in the week of June 3, when U.S. President Donald Trump is due to make a state visit to Britain, Ms. May has said she will agree to a timetable for the election of her successor. Before then, the government is considering holding a series of “indicative votes” to see what path, if any, lawmakers might be able to agree on. “When we come to bring the legislation forward we will think carefully about … the outcome of these talks, we will also consider whether we have some votes to see if the ideas that have come through command a majority in the House of Commons,” Ms. May said. Boris Johnson, the face of the campaign for Britain to leave the EU, said he would be standing as a candidate to replace Ms. May as Conservative leader. “As we look to the future, we have to listen to the public,” Simon Clarke, a Conservative lawmaker, said on Twitter. “Boris Johnson is the only candidate who increases likelihood to vote Conservative among both our 2017 voters & people planning to vote [for the newly formed] Brexit Party.” The winner of a leadership contest will automatically become prime minister and will take control of the Brexit process, which has plunged Britain into its worst political crisis since the Second World War. Mr. Johnson has been one of May’s most outspoken critics over Brexit and supports leaving the EU without a deal. Parliament has repeatedly said it does not want a no-deal Brexit. The Brexit crisis has left the United Kingdom divided and smaller parties – such as Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party and the pro-EU Liberal Democrats – are poaching support from both the Conservative and Labour parties at the fastest rate for decades. “Britain is divided down the middle over Brexit: It was in 2016 and it is in 2019 – and that is one of the reasons why this issue is so difficult to resolve,” John Curtice, Britain’s top polling expert, told Reuters.

"88"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-taiwan-legalizes-same-sex-marriage-in-a-first-for-asia/"|"Ralph Jennings"|"Gay couples in Taiwan plan a mass wedding registration after lawmakers voted to legalize same-sex marriage, a first in Asia and a boost for LGBT rights activists who had championed the cause for two decades. Legislators pressured by LGBT groups as well as by church organizations opposed to the move on Friday approved most of a government-sponsored bill that recognizes same-sex marriages and gives couples many of the tax, insurance and child custody benefits available to male-female married couples. That makes Taiwan the first place in Asia with a comprehensive law both allowing and laying out the terms of same-sex marriage. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, a supporter of the law, tweeted: “On May 17th, 2019 in Taiwan, LoveWon. We took a big step toward true equality, and made Taiwan a better country.” “It’s a breakthrough, I have to say so,” said Shiau Hong-chi, professor of gender studies and communications management at Shih-Hsin University in Taiwan. Thousands of people, including same-sex couples, demonstrated Friday morning in the rainy streets outside parliament before the vote. Many carried rainbow-colored placards reading “The vote cannot fail.” About 50 opponents sat under a tent outside parliament and gave speeches favouring marriage between only men and women. Taiwan’s constitutional Court in May 2017 said the constitution allows same-sex marriages and gave parliament two years to adjust laws accordingly. The court order mobilized LGBT advocacy groups pushing for fair treatment, as well as opponents among church groups and advocates of traditional Chinese family values that stress the importance of marriage and producing offspring. Religion, conservative values and political systems that discourage LGBT activism have slowed momentum toward same-sex marriage in many Asian countries from Japan through much of Southeast Asia, although Thailand is exploring the legalization of same-sex civil partnerships. “This will help spark a debate in Thailand, and hopefully will help Thailand move faster on our own partnership bill,” said Wattana Keiangpa of the Asia Pacific Coalition on Male Sexual Health. Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch, said Taiwan’s action should “sound a clarion call, kicking off a larger movement across Asia to ensure equality for LGBT people and pro-active protection of their rights by governments throughout the region. No more excuses!” At least 20 same-sex couples are planning a mass marriage registration in Taipei on May 24, a spokesman for the advocacy group Marriage Equality Coalition Taiwan said. The newlyweds and hundreds of invitees will hold a mass party a day later on a blocked-off boulevard outside the presidential office, the event organizer said. The law will give a boost to Jay Lin and his partner, who hope to marry and assume joint custody of their two 2-year-old sons. They plan to register after May 24. “A lot of gay parents are excited about that already,” said Lin, a Taipei-based online streaming service founder. “I think once more people are married and more families are more comfortable being out in public, that will naturally have a beneficial impact on society and on people’s minds,” Lin said. Taiwan’s acceptance of gay and lesbian relationships began in the 1990s when leaders in today’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party championed the cause to help Taiwan stand out in Asia as an open society. Although claimed by China as its own territory, Taiwan is a self-governing democracy with a vibrant civil society dedicated to promoting rights for sexual and ethnic minorities, women, the handicapped and others. Mainland China, ruled by the authoritarian Communist Party, remains much more conservative and officials have repeatedly discouraged even the discussion of legalizing same-sex marriage. Despite that, news of Taiwan’s new law was a major trending topic on social media in China, with more than 100 million views on the Twitter-like microblogging site Weibo. Opponents in Taiwan raised fears of incest, insurance scams and children confused by having two mothers or two fathers. Both sides of the issue have held colorful street demonstrations and lobbied lawmakers. “This is going to cause a lot of morality problems,” said Lin Shih-min with the Taiwan political action group Stability of Power, which opposed the law. “From the point of view of the children, they have the right to grow up with both a mother and a father.” In November 2018, a majority of Taiwan voters rejected same-sex marriage in an advisory referendum. However, legislators favouring the bill, and voting separately on each item largely along party lines, said it followed the law as well as the spirit of the referendum. “We need to take responsibility for the referendum last year and we need to take responsibility for people who have suffered from incomplete laws or faced discrimination,” ruling party legislator Hsiao Bi-khim said during the three-hour parliament session.

"89"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-poll-stations-open-in-australian-election-opposition-tipped-to-win/"|""|"Political leaders continued frenetic 11th-hour campaigning as Australians vote on Saturday in an election likely to deliver the nation’s sixth prime minister in as many years. Opinion polls suggest the conservative Liberal Party-led coalition will lose its bid for a third three-year term and Scott Morrison will have had one of the shortest tenures as prime minister in the 118-year history of the Australian federation. Morrison is the conservatives’ third prime minister since they were first elected in 2013. He replaced Malcolm Turnbull in a leadership ballot of government colleagues in August. Morrison began the day campaigning in the island state of Tasmania in seats he hopes his party will win from the centre-left Labor Party opposition. He then flew 900 kilometres (560 miles) home to Sydney to vote and to campaign in Sydney seats. Opposition leader Bill Shorten contained his campaigning to polling centres in his home town of Melbourne where he voted Saturday morning with his wife Chloe Shorten. Shorten said he was confident Labor would win government and promised to start governing from Sunday. He said his top priorities would be to increase wages for low-paid workers, increase pay rates for working Sundays and reduce Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions. “The world will know that if Labor gets elected, Australia’s back in the fight against climate change,” Shorten told reporters. Shorten has been campaigning hard on more ambitious targets to reduce Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions. Australia is the world’s largest exporter of coal and liquefied natural gas. It is also one of the world’s worst carbon gas polluters per capita because of a heavy reliance on coal-fired electricity. As the driest continent after Antarctica, it is also particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, such as wildfires and destructive storms. The government has committed Australia to reduce its emissions by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2030. Labor has promised a 45% reduction in the same time frame. Shorten, a 52-year-old former labour union leader, has also promised a range of reforms, including the government paying all the patients’ costs for cancer treatment and a reduction of tax breaks for landlords. Morrison, a 51-year-old former tourism marketer, said he had closed Labor’s lead in opinion polls during the five-week campaign and predicted a close result. “It’s not the time to engage in Bill Shorten’s big, risky project of big taxes and big spending,” Morrison said. Morrison promises lower taxes and better economic management than Labor. An opinion poll published in The Australian newspaper on Saturday put Labor ahead of the conservatives 51.5% to 48.5%. The Newspoll-brand poll was based on a nationwide survey of 3,038 voters from Monday to Friday. It has a 1.8 percentage point margin of error. Political analyst William Bowe said it was unclear how the greater support for Labor evident in polls would translate into seats. He said the conservatives had been “trying to plot a narrow path to victory” by targeting their campaigning on vulnerable Labour seats in Sydney, Tasmania and the Northern Territory. Neither the ruling coalition nor Labor holds a majority of seats in the House of Representatives, where parties need a majority to form a government. The government lost two seats and its single-seat majority in the lower chamber in blood-letting over the dumping of Turnbull in the face of poor opinion polling. The government goes to the election holding 74 seats in the chamber that is expanding at this election from 150 seats to 151. Labour has 69 seats, with independents and minor parties holding the remainder. Both major parties are promising that whoever wins the election will remain prime minister until he next faces the voters’ judgment. The parties have changed their rules to make the process of lawmakers replacing a prime minister more difficult. During Labor’s last six years in office, the party replaced Prime Minister Kevin Rudd with his deputy Julia Gillard, then dumped her for Rudd. Polling on Australia’s west coast began two hours after the east coast stations opened. East coast stations will close at 6 p.m. (0800 GMT), two hour before voting ends in the west.

It warned at the time that growth could slow further due to trade tensions and a potentially disorderly British exit from the European Union. “But we expect that at the end of 2019 and in 2020 it will bounce back,” Lagarde said of the world economic outlook on Friday. The United States infuriated China this week when it announced it was putting Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, the world’s biggest telecoms equipment maker, on a blacklist that could make it hard to do business with U.S. companies. On Friday Beijing suggested a resumption of talks between the world’s two largest economies would be meaningless unless Washington changes course.

A third security source said the bus was carrying 25 South African tourists from the airport to the pyramids area, and that four Egyptians in a nearby car were also injured by broken glass. Security and judicial sources said a rudimentary device containing nails and pieces of metal had been detonated remotely on the perimeter of the Grand Egyptian Museum, not far from the site of a roadside blast that hit another tourist bus in December. Pictures posted on social media showed a bus with some of its windows blown out or shattered, and debris in the road next to a low wall with a hole in it. One witness told Reuters he heard a “very loud explosion” while sitting in traffic. South Africa’s foreign ministry said three of its citizens would remain in hospital in Egypt for treatment and the rest would return home. The museum is due to open next year as the new home for some of the country’s top antiquities on a site adjoining the world-famous Giza pyramids. It is part of an effort to boost tourism, a key source of foreign revenue for Egypt. The sector has been recovering after tourist numbers dropped in the wake of a 2011 uprising and the 2015 bombing of a Russian passenger jet. There was no damage to the museum from the blast, which happened 50 meters from its outer fence and more than 400 meters from the museum building, the Antiquities Ministry said in a statement. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Egyptian security forces are waging a counter insurgency campaign against Islamist militants, some with links to Islamic State, that is focused in the north of the Sinai Peninsula. Attacks outside Sinai have become relatively rare, though there have been several security incidents in recent months in Giza, across the Nile from central Cairo. In December, three Vietnamese tourists and an Egyptian guide were killed and at least 10 others injured when a roadside bomb hit their tour bus less than 4 kilometres from the Giza pyramids.

"92"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-palestinians-say-us-led-mideast-peace-conference-doomed-without-plan/"|"Josef Federman"|"The Palestinian prime minister said Monday that any American peace plan that ignores the Palestinian people’s aspirations for an independent state is doomed to fail. Mohammad Shtayyeh’s comments immediately cast a cloud over the American-led Mideast peace conference expected to take place in late June in the tiny Gulf Arab state of Bahrain. The White House announced Sunday it will unveil the first phase of its long-awaited Mideast peace plan at the conference, saying it will focus on economic benefits that could be reaped if the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is resolved. The plan envisions large-scale investment and infrastructure work, much of it funded by wealthy Arab countries, in the Palestinian territories. But officials say the June 25-26 conference will not include the core political issues of the conflict: final borders, the status of Jerusalem, the fate of Palestinian refugees or Israeli security demands. “Any solution to the conflict in Palestine must be political … and based on ending the occupation,” Shtayyeh said at a Palestinian Cabinet meeting. “The current financial crisis is a result of a financial war waged against us and we will not succumb to blackmailing and extortion and will not trade our national rights for money.” President Donald Trump’s Mideast envoy, Jason Greenblatt, said it was “difficult to understand why the Palestinian Authority would reject a workshop designed to discuss a vision with the potential to radically transform lives and put people on a path toward a brighter future.” “History will judge the Palestinian Authority harshly for passing up any opportunity that could give the Palestinians something so very different, and something so very positive, compared to what they have today,” Greenblatt said. In another setback, Bashar Masri, a Palestinian industrialist with vast business holdings throughout the West Bank, said he had turned down an invitation to the conference. “I will not participate in this conference, and none of the representatives of our companies will participate,” he wrote on Facebook. “We reaffirm our clear position: We will not deal with any event outside the Palestinian national consensus.” The Palestinians severed ties with the U.S. over a year ago over Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. They have repeatedly expressed fears that the White House will try to buy them off with large sums of investment in exchange for freezing their demands for an independent state. They believe the U.S. is trying to rally support from other Arab countries to bully them into accepting a plan that would legitimize the Israeli occupation. In a joint statement with Bahrain, the White House said the gathering will give government, civil and business leaders a chance to rally support for economic initiatives that could be possible with a peace agreement. “The Palestinian people, along with all people in the Middle East, deserve a future with dignity and the opportunity to better their lives,” Trump’s senior adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, said in a statement Sunday. “Economic progress can only be achieved with a solid economic vision and if the core political issues are resolved.” The tiny island nation of Bahrain, off the coast of Saudi Arabia, has signalled its willingness to open relations with Israel. Prominent rabbis in 2017 said King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa told them he hoped the Arab boycott of Israel would end. Bahrain hosts the U.S. Navy’s Fifth Fleet and is a close ally of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which are widely believed to be seeking closer ties to Israel, viewing it as a potential ally against Iran, a shared enemy. Kushner and Greenblatt, have been leading efforts to draft the plan, but after more than two years of work, they have not released any details. A senior administration official in Washington told reporters Sunday that invitations to the conference are being sent to individuals in the United States, Europe, the Gulf, the wider Arab world and “some” Palestinian business leaders. The official spoke on condition of anonymity pending a formal announcement. There were no details on who might attend, or whether the internationally-backed Palestinian Authority in the West Bank was invited. Israel’s Finance Ministry said it had not been invited. In the absence of direct talks with Palestinian leaders, U.S. officials often talk of engaging Palestinians in the private sector and “civil society” groups. Trump’s ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, has embraced the “Judea and Samaria Chamber of Commerce,” a group led by Israeli West Bank settlers that seeks business ties with Palestinian partners. The group’s Palestinian co-founder, businessman Ashraf Jabari, said he had been invited and planned on attending. It is unclear how any large-scale projects would be carried out in the Gaza Strip. The U.S. and Israel consider Gaza’s Hamas rulers to be a terrorist group and have no direct contacts with them. The Palestinians seek the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza — territories captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war — for an independent state. Breaking from the policies of its predecessors, the Trump administration has refused to endorse a two-state solution. Trump recognized contested Jerusalem as Israel’s capital in December 2017 and subsequently moved the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The U.S. has also cut hundreds of millions of dollars of aid for the Palestinians and closed the Palestinian diplomatic office in Washington. The Palestinians have already said they would reject any peace plan offered by the U.S., saying Trump is unfairly biased toward Israel. Kushner said it has been disheartening that the Palestinian leadership has attacked the plan before it’s unveiled. Earlier this month, Kushner insisted that the plan he’s helped craft is a detailed, fresh approach that he hopes will stimulate discussion and lead to a breakthrough in solving the decades-old conflict. At a think-tank in Washington, Kushner described it as an “in-depth operational document” not anchored to previous, failed negotiations, high-level political concepts or stale arguments.

"93"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-trump-iran-trade-twitter-warnings-over-back-and-forth-threats/"|"Jon Gambrell"|"U.S. President Donald Trump warned Iran early on Monday not to threaten the United States again or it’ll face its “official end,” shortly after a rocket landed near the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad overnight. Iran’s foreign minister quickly responded in kind on Twitter with his own message: #NeverThreatenAnIranian. Mr. Trump’s tweet comes after he seemingly sought to soften his tone on Iran following days of heightened tension sparked by his administration’s sudden deployment of bombers and an aircraft carrier to the Persian Gulf over still-unspecified threats. In the time since, officials in the United Arab Emirates allege four oil tankers sustained damage in a sabotage attack. Yemeni rebels allied with Iran launched a drone attack on an oil pipeline in Saudi Arabia. U.S. diplomats relayed a warning that commercial airlines could be misidentified by Iran and attacked, something dismissed by Tehran. All these tensions are the culmination of Mr. Trump’s decision a year ago to pull the United States out of Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers. And while both Washington and Tehran say they don’t seek war, many worry any miscalculation at this fraught moment could spiral out of control. The tweet from Mr. Trump early on Monday came just hours after a Katyusha rocket fell in Baghdad’s heavily fortified Green Zone near the statue of the Unknown Soldier, less than a mile from the U.S. Embassy, causing no injuries. Iraqi military spokesman Brigadier-General Yahya Rasoul told the Associated Press that the rocket was believed to have been fired from east Baghdad. The area is home to Iran-backed Shiite militias. “If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran,” Mr. Trump tweeted. “Never threaten the United States again!” Mr. Trump did not elaborate, nor did the White House. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif posted his own message Monday on Twitter, saying Mr. Trump had been “goaded” into “genocidal taunts.” Mr. Zarif namechecked both Alexander the Great and Genghis Khan as two historical leaders that Persia outlasted. “Iranians have stood tall for a millennia while aggressors all gone,” he wrote. He ended his tweet with: “Try respect - it works!” Mr. Trump campaigned on pulling the United States economic sanctions. Since the withdrawal, the United States has re-imposed previous sanctions and come up with new ones, as well as warned countries around the world they would be subject to sanctions as well if they import Iranian oil. Iran just announced it would begin backing away from terms of the deal, setting a 60-day deadline for Europe to come up with new terms or it would begin enriching uranium closer to weapons-grade levels. Tehran has insisted it does not seek nuclear weapons, although the West fears its program could allow it to build atomic bombs. In an interview aired Sunday on the Fox News Channel, Mr. Trump called the nuclear deal a “horror show.” “I just don’t want them to have nuclear weapons and they can’t be threatening us,” Mr. Trump said. However, the nuclear deal had kept Iran from being able to acquire enough highly enriched uranium for a bomb. UN inspectors repeatedly certified that Iran was in compliance with the accord. British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt told journalists in Geneva that Iran should not doubt the United States’ resolve, warning that “if American interests are attacked, they will retaliate.” “We want the situation to de-escalate because this is a part of the world where things can get triggered accidentally,” Mr. Hunt said. Meanwhile, Oman’s minister of state for foreign affairs made a previously unannounced visit Monday to Tehran, seeing Mr. Zarif, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. The visit by Yusuf bin Alawi comes after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called Oman’s Sultan Qaboos bin Said last week. Oman long has served as a Western backchannel to Tehran and the sultanate hosted the secret talks between the United States and Oman that laid the groundwork for the nuclear deal negotiations. In Saudi Arabia, the kingdom’s military intercepted two missiles fired by the Houthi rebels in neighbouring Yemen. The missiles were intercepted over the city of Taif and the Red Sea port city of Jiddah, the Saudi-owned satellite channel Al-Arabiya reported. The channel cited witnesses for the information. The Saudi government has yet to acknowledge the missile fire, which other Saudi media also reported. Hundreds of rockets, mortars and ballistic missiles have been fired into the kingdom since a Saudi-led coalition declared war on the Houthis in March, 2015 to support Yemen’s internationally recognized government. However, the Houthis’ Al-Masirah satellite news channel denied Monday that the rebels had any involvement with this round of rocket fire. Between the two targeted cities is Mecca, home to the cube-shaped Kaaba that Muslims pray toward five times a day. Many religious pilgrims are now in the city amid the Muslim holy fasting month of Ramadan. Meanwhile, the U.S. Navy’s 5th Fleet on Sunday announced it would begin “enhanced security patrols” in international waters with members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, which includes Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Already, the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier, the amphibious assault ship USS Kearsarge and others are in the Arabian Sea, waters close to the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which a third of all oil traded at sea passes.

"94"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-rouhani-rejects-talks-with-us-says-iran-faces-an-economic-war/"|""|"Iranian President Hassan Rouhani rejected talks with the United States on Tuesday, after President Donald Trump said Iran would call and ask for negotiations “if and when they are ever ready.” Tehran and Washington have escalated rhetoric against each other in recent weeks as the United States has tightened sanctions with what it says is the goal of pushing Iran to make concessions beyond the terms of its 2015 nuclear deal. Trump withdrew the United States a year ago from the deal between Iran and global powers, under which Tehran curbed its uranium enrichment capacity, a potential pathway to a nuclear bomb, and won sanctions relief in return. Trump restored U.S. sanctions on Iran last year and extended them this month, ordering all countries to halt imports of Iranian oil or face sanctions of their own. Iran has repeatedly rejected any further negotiations as long as the United States remains outside the nuclear pact. “Today’s situation is not suitable for talks and our choice is resistance only,” state news agency IRNA quoted Rouhani as saying. Trump said on Monday that Iran would be met with “great force” if it attempted anything against U.S. interests in the Middle East. He said reports Washington was trying to set up talks were false, but “Iran will call us if and when they are ever ready.” Critics have accused Trump of sending mixed signals. Last week three U.S. officials told Reuters that Trump had told his top advisers he does not want war with Iran. Iran has portrayed the hot and cold rhetoric as evidence Trump is being goaded into war against his better judgment by hardline aides such as National Security Adviser John Bolton. “Right after threatening Iran, they were forced to say they do not seek a war,” Rouhani said in televised remarks on Tuesday. “Iranians will never bow to a bully.” Rouhani won two landslide elections in Iran on promises to ease its international isolation. But Trump’s decision to abandon the 2015 nuclear deal has helped ensure that Iranians have felt little or no economic benefit from Rouhani’s policies. The rial currency lost about 60 per cent of its value in 2018 under the threat of the revived U.S. sanctions, boosting inflation and provoking sporadic demonstrations. Iran has cracked down on businessmen it accuses of profiteering. Rouhani said the country faced “economic war,” and the government needed more powers to control the economy. Judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili said courts had sentenced 10 businessmen to up to 20 years in jail on charges including “economic sabotage,” the semi-official news agency Fars reported on Tuesday. Iran executed at least three businessmen for economic crimes last year. Washington’s European allies say they share U.S. concerns about Iran’s behaviour, but disagree with Trump’s decision to pull out of the nuclear deal, arguing that it undermines Rouhani’s pragmatic faction and boosts Iran’s hardliners. They have sought to ensure Iran still benefits from the nuclear deal by finding ways for foreign companies to do business there. But in practice this has so far failed, with companies cancelling investments for fear of U.S. punishment. Iran said this month it could resume uranium enrichment beyond levels allowed in the nuclear deal if European countries do not find ways to ease financial pressure within 60 days. French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire said the Iranian threats were not helpful: “I do not think that Europe will get drawn into this idea of an ultimatum,” Le Maire told reporters. Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi said on Tuesday Iraq would send delegations to both Washington and Tehran to help ease the tension between them. Iraq is one of the few countries with close relations with both the United States and Iran, which each have helped it fight against Islamic State militants. Washington abruptly pulled non-essential staff from its embassy in Baghdad last week, citing a threat from Iran-backed militias in Iraq.

In an impassioned speech Tuesday in London, Ms. May outlined what she called “a new Brexit deal” and urged MPs to get behind it. “I say with conviction to every MP of every party: I have compromised. Now I ask you to compromise too,” she said. The new proposals are meant to address the concerns of a growing number of MPs who have rejected the deal three times by a wide margin. But it’s far from certain Ms. May will be able to win over enough converts: many MPs, including a group of rebels within her Conservative Party caucus, have already come out against the new plan, and pressure is mounting on the Prime Minister to resign. The changes proposed Tuesday by Ms. May include keeping the United Kingdom in line with EU regulations on workers’ rights and environmental protection. She also plans to give MPs an increased role in future negotiations with the EU on a trade deal and a say in whether the country should remain in a customs arrangement with the bloc, which would allow for the free movement of goods. MPs would also have an opportunity to vote on whether to hold a second referendum on Brexit. The new plan “is practical. It is responsible. It is deliverable. And right now, it is slipping away from us,” she said. Ms. May has been trying to win parliamentary approval for the Brexit deal since last November. Britain’s departure from the bloc was supposed to happen March 29, but the EU has extended the deadline to Oct. 31. Ms. May acknowledged Tuesday that her latest plan, which will be put to Parliament in early June in the form of a bill, represented “one last chance” to get the deal approved. She warned MPs that if they voted against it for a fourth time, they would be voting against Brexit. “If they do so, the consequences could hardly be greater,” she said. “Reject this deal and leaving the EU with a negotiated deal any time soon will be dead in the water.” The new proposals appear to be too little too late, and opposition to the proposed bill has been growing. A group of Ms. May’s fellow Conservative MPs said Tuesday that they will vote against it – including several MPs who supported the Brexit deal on previous occasions in the House of Commons. Many Tory MPs have been calling on Ms. May to resign this summer. They worry that if Parliament were to approve the revised deal it would bind the hands of the next party leader, who would also take over as Prime Minister. Ms. May has offered to resign once the deal is passed, but she has been vague about when she would step down if it is rejected. That has led to a revolt among Tory MPs who have demanded that she quit after the vote regardless of the outcome. The backlash has forced her to agree to discuss her future with caucus members next month once the vote has concluded. “I wouldn’t put money on my backing the deal,” Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said Tuesday. Another Tory rebel, MP Mark Francois, said Ms. May’s new plan was “dead on arrival.” The opposition Labour Party has also come out against the new plan despite spending six weeks negotiating changes with the Prime Minister. Those talks collapsed last week, largely over Labour’s insistence on the U.K. remaining within the EU’s customs union. Ms. May’s proposed plan "doesn’t inspire confidence, and I don’t think that many of our members will be inspired by it,” said Labour MP John McDonnell. Much of the opposition to Ms. May’s Brexit deal has to do with the backstop provision, which would keep Northern Ireland largely bound to EU regulations in order to avoid a hard border with Ireland. Many Tory MPs say that violates the spirit of Brexit because it would keep the U.K. bound to the EU. Ms. May tried to address those complaints Tuesday by proposing to seek alternatives to the backstop and offering Northern Ireland’s assembly more say in how the backstop would be implemented. But that hasn’t eased the concern of many Tory MPs who want the backstop scrapped. Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), whose 10 MPs prop up Ms. May’s minority government, has also been cool to the new proposals, and on Tuesday its MPs said they would wait to see more details. “We will have to await the publication of the text of the bill to see what the proposals actually mean, but the fact is that the fatal flaws of the draft [Brexit deal] remain,” said Nigel Dodds, the deputy leader of the DUP, in a statement.

"96"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-houthi-rebels-attack-saudi-airport-military-base-with-bomb-carrying/"|"Jon Gambrell"|"Yemen’s Iranian-allied Houthi rebels attacked a Saudi airport and military base with a bomb-laden drone Tuesday, an assault acknowledged by the kingdom as Middle East tensions remained high between Tehran and Washington. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage. The attack on the Saudi city of Najran came after Iran announced it has quadrupled its uranium-enrichment production capacity, though still at a level far lower than needed for atomic weapons, a year after the U.S. withdrew from Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers. Underlining the tensions, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani is seeking expanded executive powers to better deal with “economic war” triggered by the Trump’s administration’s renewal and escalation of sanctions targeting the Islamic Republic, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. “A person or a nation might be under pressure but the Iranian nation will not bow to bullies,” Rouhani vowed in a televised speech Tuesday night. By increasing production, Iran soon will exceed the stockpile limitations set by the nuclear accord. Tehran has set a July 7 deadline for Europe to put forth new terms for the deal, or it will enrich closer to weapons-grade levels in a Middle East already on edge. The U.S. has deployed bombers and an aircraft carrier to the Persian Gulf over still-unspecified threats from Iran, which is the biggest rival in the region to the U.S.-allied Saudi Arabia. Before a briefing on the situation to Congress, acting Defence Secretary Patrick Shanahan suggested the U.S. military response to Iranian threats has already had an effect. He said U.S. military moves have given Iran “time to recalculate” and as a result the potential for attacks on Americans is “on hold,” although the threat has not gone away. In the drone attack, the Houthis’ Al-Masirah satellite news channel said they targeted the airport in Najran with a Qasef-2K drone, striking an “arms depot.” Najran, 840 kilometres (525 miles) southwest of Riyadh, lies on the Saudi-Yemen border and has repeatedly been targeted by the Houthis. A statement on the state-run Saudi Press Agency quoted Saudi-led coalition spokesman Col. Turki al-Maliki as saying the Houthis “had tried to target” a civilian site in Najran, without elaborating. Al-Maliki warned there would be a “strong deterrent” to such attacks and described the Houthis as the “terrorist militias of Iran.” Similar Houthi attacks have sparked Saudi-led air strikes on Yemen, which have been widely criticized internationally for killing civilians. Civilian airports across the Middle East often host military bases. The New York Times reported last year that American intelligence analysts were based in Najran, assisting the Saudis and a deployment of U.S. Army Green Berets on the border. Lt. Col. Earl Brown, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command, said there were “no U.S. personnel involved nor present at Najran” at the time of the attack. Last week, the Houthis launched a co-ordinated drone attack on a Saudi oil pipeline. Earlier this month, officials in the United Arab Emirates alleged that four oil tankers were sabotaged and U.S. diplomats relayed a warning that commercial airlines could be misidentified by Iran and attacked, something dismissed by Tehran. In its nuclear program announcement Monday night, Iranian officials stressed that the uranium would be enriched only to the 3.67 per cent limit set under the 2015 nuclear deal, making it usable for a power plant but far below what’s needed for an atomic weapon. Iran said it had told the International Atomic Energy Agency of the development. The Vienna-based UN nuclear watchdog did not respond to a request for comment. Tehran long has insisted it does not seek nuclear weapons, though the West fears its program could allow it to build them. President Donald Trump, who campaigned on a promise to pull the U.S. from the Iran deal, has alternated tough talk with more conciliatory statements – a strategy he says is aimed at keeping Iran guessing at the administration’s intentions. Trump also has said he hopes Iran calls him and engages in negotiations. But while Trump’s approach of flattery and threats has become a hallmark of his foreign policy, the risks have only grown in dealing with Iran, where mistrust between Tehran and Washington goes back four decades. While both sides say they don’t seek war, many worry any miscalculation could spiral out of control. A Trump tweet Monday warning Iran would face its “official end” if it threatened the U.S. drew sharp rebuke from Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Twitter, who used the hashtag #NeverThreatenAnIranian. In Iran, it remains unclear what powers Rouhani seeks. In Iran’s 1980s war with Iraq, a wartime supreme council was able to bypass other branches to make decisions regarding the economy and the war. “Today, we need such powers,” Rouhani said, according to IRNA. He added that country “is united that we should resist the U.S. and the sanctions.” Meanwhile, former U.S. Secretary of Defence Jim Mattis told an audience in the United Arab Emirates on Monday night that America “needs to engage more in the world and intervene militarily less.” While “Iran’s behaviour must change,” he urged the U.S. not to engage in unilateral action and that American “military must work to buy time for diplomats to work their magic.” “I will assure you no nation will be more honest with you than America,” the retired Marine Corps general said, according to a report in the state-linked newspaper The National. “America will frustrate you at times because of its form of government, but the UAE and America will always find their way back to common ground, on that I have no doubt.” Mattis abruptly resigned in December after clashing with Trump over withdrawing troops in Syria. He spoke at a previously unannounced speech before a Ramadan lecture series in honour of Abu Dhabi’s powerful crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.

Volodymyr Zelenskiy, a 41-year-old TV comedian who won 73 per cent of the presidential vote last month, announced his intention of disbanding parliament in his inauguration speech Monday, saying that current lawmakers were too focused on self-enrichment and lacked public trust. He quickly fulfilled the promise in Tuesday’s decree, which set a parliamentary election for July 21. Zelenskiy’s landslide victory reflected Ukrainians’ exasperation with the country’s economic woes, rampant official corruption and the country’s political elite. The election to Ukraine’s Verkhovna Rada legislature was originally scheduled for Oct. 27. That would have left Zelenskiy facing a parliament dominated by supporters of the man he beat, former President Petro Poroshenko, and unable to pursue his anti-corruption agenda for months. Zelenskiy, who has become famous for playing the role of a Ukrainian president in a widely popular TV sitcom, was gambling that his popularity will allow his party to make a successful showing in the parliamentary vote. “Zelenskiy is trying to act as quickly as possible, because he realizes that voters’ excitement will cool down in half a year,” said Volodymyr Fesenko, head of the Kyiv-based independent think-tank Penta. His foes in parliament had sought to push Zelenskiy’s inauguration past the May 27 deadline by which the parliament could be dissolved, but eventually had to submit to public pressure. Zelenskiy already has asked several top ministers to step down, but he would likely have trouble getting their successors appointed by the current parliament. On Tuesday, he asked the parliament speaker to call an emergency session to discuss amendments to Ukraine’s electoral law. Zelenskiy has called for electing the next parliament entirely on party lists, arguing that the current system in which part of parliament is elected in single ballot races foments corruption. In his inaugural speech, Zelenskiy said the main goal of his presidency is to bring peace to eastern Ukraine, where government troops have been fighting Russia-backed separatists for five years in a conflict that has left at least 13,000 dead. He said that Ukraine would rely on Western help in talking to Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin talked about Ukraine among other issues in a conference call with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron. Putin emphasized the need for the Ukrainian government to enact legislation granting special status to the rebel regions in line with a 2015 Minsk agreement sponsored by France and Germany, according to the Kremlin. Putin also noted that the Ukrainian government must establish direct dialogue with the rebels. On Tuesday, Zelenskiy dismissed the nation’s top military officer, Gen. Viktor Muzhenko, replacing him with Lt. Gen. Ruslan Khomchak. Khomchak, 51, has served as the chief of staff of the military’s ground forces and took part in the fighting in eastern Ukraine. Zelenskiy also named 42-year-old lawyer Andriy Bohdan as his chief of staff. Bohdan, who worked as a deputy justice minister in the past, served as Zelenskiy’s legal adviser during the election campaign. Speaking on television after his appointment, Bohdan said that a possible peace deal with Russia must be put to a referendum. “We are forced to look for a compromise,” he said, adding that Zelenskiy has emphasized that he wouldn’t “trade in our territories and our people.” "|"Ukraine’s new president orders dissolution of parliament, calls snap election"|"2019-05-21T11:46:57-0400"|"Ukraine,Ukraine Parliament,Ukraine election,Volodymyr Zelenskiy,Volodymyr Zelensky,Verkhovna Rada,Petro Poroshenko,Russia,Vladimir Putin,news,world,parliament,ukraine,zelenskiy,country",

North Korea’s UN Ambassador Kim Song held a rare news conference at the United Nations in New York to demand the immediate return of the ship, which the United States said earlier this month it had seized over accusations it was used for coal shipments in violation of U.S. and UN sanctions. “The United States should deliberate and think over the consequences its outrageous act might have on the future developments. Also the United States must return our cargo ship without delay,” Mr. Kim said. “We regard it as part of our territory where our sovereignty is fully exercised.” He said the seizure of the ship, known as the Wise Honest, defied the spirit of a statement by U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un after their first meeting in Singapore in June, 2018. They pledged to build new ties between their countries and work toward North Korea’s denuclearization. The U.S. Justice Department earlier this month said the ship was seized and impounded to American Samoa. The vessel was first detained by Indonesia in April, 2018. A second meeting between Mr. Trump and Kim Jong-un in Hanoi broke down in February. With talks on denuclearization stalled, North Korea went ahead with more weapons tests this month. The tests were seen as a protest by Kim Jong-un after Mr. Trump rejected his calls for sanctions relief at the Hanoi summit. The UN Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs, banning exports including coal, iron, lead, textiles and seafood, and capping imports of crude oil and refined petroleum products. “We will carefully watch every move of the United States,” Mr. Kim said. Mr. Kim wrote to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday to ask him to take “urgent measures” over the issue. UN spokesman Stéphane Dujarric said on Tuesday that the letter had been received. “We’re taking a look at it. The issue of sanctions, the implementation of sanctions, the interpretation of sanctions, is really a matter for the UN Security Council to decide and to discuss,” he said.

"99"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-japan-looks-to-woo-trump-to-avoid-trade-battle/"|"Tim Kelly"|"Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will treat U.S. President Donald Trump to an imperial banquet, front row seats at a sumo tournament and a trip to the country’s biggest warship on a state visit as Tokyo seeks to avoid a bust-up over trade. New Japanese Emperor Naruhito and Harvard-educated Empress Masako will host a lavish dinner for Trump during his stay through May 28, part of a display meant to showcase the two countries’ alliance. The U.S. leader will become the first foreign dignitary to be so honoured since the monarch inherited the throne this month. Trump will also play golf with Abe and inspect Japan’s Kaga helicopter carrier. At their summit on Monday, Trump and Abe are expected to discuss topics from North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs and China’s economic and military rise to two-way trade at a time when Washington is embroiled in a trade war with Beijing. “Various issues will come up during President Trump’s visit but I don’t think they will be so severe,” Kenji Wakamiya, chairman of the lower House Foreign Affairs Committee, told a Reuters News seminar this week. “I don’t think (demands) will be as harsh as towards China.” Abe has made forging close personal ties with Trump a top priority and the two have bonded on the links, over burgers and with frequent telephone calls and face-to-face meetings. “It’s part of Prime Minister Abe’s full embrace of Mr. Trump,” Toshihiro Nakayama, a Japan Fellow at the Wilson Center in Washington, said of Trump’s visit. “What Prime Minister Abe has done was quite effective and you can even say strategic, because for Mr. Trump, personal chemistry is quite important.” Designating Trump’s stay in Tokyo as an official state visit means that it is by definition supposed to be a success, said former diplomat Kunihiko Miyake, research director at the Canon Institute for Global Studies. “It’s more ceremonial and symbolic than substantive,” Miyake said. “As far as trade issues are concerned, America’s first priority is China.” Trump has nonetheless made clear he is unhappy with Japan’s $68-billion trade surplus with the United States, much of it from auto exports, and wants a two-way deal to tackle it. Japan’s trade surplus with the United States rose 17.7% in April from a year earlier, to 723.2 billion yen ($6.6 billion), driven partly by an increase of 8.3% in auto exports, data showed this week. Last Friday, Trump declared some imported vehicles and parts posed a national security threat but delayed a decision on imposing tariffs for as long as six months, allowing more time for trade talks with Japan and the European Union. Japan says it opposes limits on its exports, a violation of world trade rules. “We are not in the 1980s or 1990s,” Miyake said, referring to the era of Japan’s “voluntary” restraints on auto exports to the United States. “It’s a non-starter.” U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who leads the talks for Washington, will visit Japan from Friday to meet Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi before the summit, two sources with direct knowledge of the plan said. Trump pressed Abe for Japanese automakers to turn out more vehicles in the United States at a meeting in Washington last month, according to U.S. Ambassador William Hagerty – a move Wakamiya said could be an option. Trump said at the time that a trade deal was possible by his May visit and told a campaign rally last month that Abe had said Japan would invest $40 billion in U.S. car factories, a figure that had some Japanese officials scratching their heads. Washington also wants Tokyo to cut tariffs on U.S. farm products to restore their competitiveness after Trump shunned an 11-nation Pacific trade pact. However, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said last week that the administration realized Abe faced an upper house election in July that could make an early deal tough. “I hope we will have significant progress here very, very shortly,” Hagerty said this week.

He boasted of his humble origins while doing favours for billionaires. He spoke the language of business, yet could not deliver enough jobs to Indians aspiring to a better life. Despite those contradictions, Narendra Modi, India’s incumbent prime minister, led his party to a stunning election victory on Thursday, eviscerating the opposition and giving Hindu nationalists the strongest hand they have ever held in modern Indian history. His mix of brawny Hindu nationalism, populist humility and grand gestures for the poor – such as building tens of millions of new toilets – helped him become the first prime minister in nearly 50 years to win a majority in successive parliamentary elections. “This is the victory of the mother who was longing for a toilet,” Mr. Modi said in a speech to supporters on Thursday night. “This victory is of the farmers who sweat to fill the stomachs of others.” Many Indians see Mr. Modi, 68, as a nationalist icon. He stood up to China, nearly went to war with Pakistan and brought India closer to the United States. During the campaign, he described himself as the chowkidar – the watchman. And many Indians felt he was the best leader to raise India’s standing in the world. His success mirrors the rise of right-leaning populist figures around the world. But detractors say his commitment to giving more power to the country’s Hindu majority has struck fear in the Muslim minority and is pulling the country’s delicate social fabric apart. Under him, mob lynchings have shot up, Muslim representation in parliament has dropped to its lowest level in decades, and right-wing Hindus have felt emboldened to push an extreme agenda, including lionizing the man who fatally shot the independence hero Mohandas K. Gandhi. Yet in Indian politics today, no other figure can approach Mr. Modi’s aura. Analysts call him “larger than life” and “a cinematic character.” His Bharatiya Janata Party, by far India’s richest and most aggressive, has built a personality cult around him, and in speeches he refers to himself in the third person. “Are you happy that Modi kills by entering homes?” he thundered at a recent rally, recalling the air strike he ordered on Pakistan in February. “Doesn’t your chest puff out with pride?” The crowd cheered. “Modi has embedded himself in every Indian’s consciousness,” said Arati Jerath, a prominent newspaper columnist. In contrast, Rahul Gandhi, the leader of the opposition Indian National Congress party and the scion of a long political dynasty, is widely perceived as inexperienced and weak. In acknowledging his defeat, Gandhi said that the country was engaged in a long ideological battle, and “love never loses.” The election turnout was one for the history books – the largest democratic exercise ever. From April 11 to May 19, more than 600 million Indians cast ballots at a million polling stations from high in the Himalayas to the tropical islands in the Andaman Sea. Intense feelings about Mr. Modi, for or against, helped drive turnout to 67 per cent, the highest ever. Even some voters who were worried about the economy or did not like the way Mr. Modi had stirred communal divisions said they still saw him as the best leader for India now. “Farmers are in trouble,” said Vinay Tyagi, a wheat and sugar cane farmer in the swing state of Uttar Pradesh. “But we still voted for the BJP because there was no alternative for us. The other candidates weren’t good.” To keep his job, Mr. Modi campaigned relentlessly, holding 142 rallies and covering 65,000 miles. On the night before voting ended, he meditated in a Himalayan cave in the same area where, more than 50 years earlier, he had wandered as a young man searching for purpose. Mr. Modi will be the first two-time prime minister ever to come from a lower caste. He grew up in a small town north of Ahmadabad, in the state of Gujarat. This has been a powerful part of his narrative: He calls himself a lowly chaiwalla, a tea-seller, a clear jab at India’s elite. At age 8, he became part of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a right-wing Hindu group that would play a huge role in his life. Its members are the foot soldiers of the Hindu nationalist movement, and some critics have accused it of embracing fascism – in the 1930s, the group’s members were inspired by Mussolini’s Italy. In school, Mr. Modi was known as an average student, but he demonstrated a talent for theatre and debating. When he was around 18, he went on his Himalayan sojourn, contemplating a life as an ascetic priest. In a recent interview, he said that he had bathed in freezing rivers, hung around holy men and learned to “align himself with the rhythm of the universe.” He also deserted the young woman whom his parents had arranged for him to marry. Even now it is unclear whether Mr. Modi ever lived with her. In his twenties and thirties, he was a preacher for the RSS, and then a worker for the BJP in Gujarat, where he oversaw the printing of banned pamphlets pushing Hindutva, the belief in the primacy of the Hindu religion and way of life. Analysts say he remains an “ultranationalist” at his core. “He is very divisive,” said Ms. Jerath, the newspaper columnist. “He believes in the politics of polarization: us against them, Hindus against Muslims, rich against poor, poor against rich.” A pivotal event came in February, 2002, when Gujarat exploded in religious riots. Mr. Modi, then chief minister of the state, was blamed for not stopping the bloodshed, which left more than 1,000 people dead, most of them Muslim. From then on, Mr. Modi would be known among the Hindu right as a hero. Many Muslims considered him a killer. But in the next few years, Mr. Modi sought to cultivate a different reputation. He became a friend of free enterprise and helped attract thousands of manufacturing jobs to Gujarat. Business people and middle-class voters began to rally around him, seeing him as someone who could get results. At the same time, the dynastic Congress party, which led India for most of its history since independence from Britain, was collapsing, plagued by scandals and the absence of an inspiring leader. In 2014, the first time Mr. Modi ran for prime minister, he emphasized infrastructure, development and rooting out corruption. His BJP won a landslide, and Congress suffered its biggest defeat – winning only 44 seats out of 543, the party’s worst showing in its 100-year-plus history. Once in office, Mr. Modi swiftly consolidated power, making big decisions within a small circle of advisers. He quickly announced several high-profile social programs, including the building of 100 million new toilets, a goal his government has nearly reached. Many voters in this election cited the toilets – and the dignity they brought – as one reason for giving him their vote. But there were also troubling signs. Hindu nationalists, encouraged by the election of one of their own to the country’s highest office, began persecuting and even killing Muslims and low-caste Hindus. Mr. Modi and his party appointed Hindu nationalists to key posts at universities and government agencies. They changed place names from Muslim to Hindu and rewrote children’s history books, purging entire sections on Muslim rulers. In November, 2016, Mr. Modi suddenly invalidated most of the nation’s currency in the name of fighting corruption. The move made it nearly impossible to use cash in a country that relied on it for nearly everything. Seven months later, the government replaced a complex set of state taxes with a single national goods and services tax. While most economists say it was a sensible reform, the new system was so complicated that it caused chaos at millions of small businesses. The twin blows battered the economy and paralyzed job growth in a country where 5 million young people enter the work force every year. He was also criticized for signing a multibillion-dollar fighter jet deal with France that sent part of the work to an Indian billionaire with no experience. Still, supporters say that Mr. Modi cut bureaucracy for businesses, invested in major infrastructure like roads and tried to tackle some of India’s biggest problems, such as a lack of health care for the poor. As the campaign began, many analysts predicted that Mr. Modi would lose support over India’s economic challenges. Everything changed on Feb. 14, when a suicide bomber blew up a bus of paramilitary forces in Pulwama in the state of Kashmir, which both India and Pakistan claim. Jingoism surged, and so did Mr. Modi’s approval ratings. He campaigned hard on national security, and voters seemed to respond. “The scale of the win is remarkable,” said Menaka Guruswamy, a senior lawyer in India’s Supreme Court and lecturer at Columbia Law School. But she added: “I don’t know of a word that begins to capture how deeply divided we are at this point.” "|"India’s Narendra Modi captures historic election victory"|"2019-05-23T09:10:30-0400"|"India,India election,Narendra Modi,Bharatiya Janata Party,Kashmir,Pakistan,news,world,india,country,modi,hindu,life,minister,victory", 
"101"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-john-walker-lindh-man-known-as-the-american-taliban-released-from-u/"|"Matthew Barakat"|"John Walker Lindh, the Californian who took up arms for the Taliban and was captured by U.S. forces in Afghanistan in 2001, got out of prison Thursday after more than 17 years, released under tight restrictions that reflected government fears he still harbours radical views. President Donald Trump reacted by saying, “I don’t like it at all.” “Here’s a man who has not given up his proclamation of terror,” he said. Lindh, 38, left a federal penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana, after getting time off for good behaviour from the 20-year sentence he received when he pleaded guilty to providing support to the Taliban. It was not immediately clear where the man known as the “American Taliban” will live or what he will do. He turned down an interview request last week, and his attorney declined to comment Thursday. In a Fox News interview, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo decried Lindh’s early release as “unexplainable and unconscionable” and called for a review of prison system policies. The president said he asked lawyers whether there was anything that could be done to block Lindh from getting out but was told no. Trump said the U.S. will closely monitor him. Under restrictions imposed by a federal judge in Alexandria, Virginia, Lindh’s internet devices must have monitoring software; his online communications must be conducted in English; he must undergo mental health counselling; he is forbidden to possess or view extremist material; and he cannot hold a passport or leave the U.S. FBI counterterrorism officials work with federal prison authorities to determine what risk a soon-to-be-released inmate might pose. Probation officers never explained why they sought the restrictions against Lindh. But in 2017, Foreign Policy magazine cited a National Counterterrorism Center report that said Lindh “continued to advocate for global jihad and to write and translate violent extremist texts.” On Wednesday, NBC reported that Lindh, in a letter to a producer from Los Angeles-based affiliate KNBC, wrote in 2015 that the Islamic State group was “doing a spectacular job.” Lindh converted to Islam as a teenager after seeing the movie “Malcolm X” and eventually made his way to Pakistan and Afghanistan and joined the Taliban. He met Osama bin Laden and was with the Taliban on Sept. 11, 2001, when al-Qaida terrorists attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Lindh was captured on the battlefield after the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan following 9-11 and was initially charged with conspiring to kill Mike Spann, a CIA operative who died during an uprising of Taliban prisoners shortly after interrogating Lindh. Lindh denied any role in Spann’s death. But he admitted carrying an assault rifle and two grenades during his time with the Taliban. Spann’s daughter Alison Spann, now a journalist in Mississippi, posted a letter on Twitter that she said she had sent to Trump. In it, she called Lindh’s early release “a slap in the face” to everyone killed on 9-11 and in the war on terror since then, along with “the millions of Muslims worldwide who don’t support radical extremists.” Republican Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby and Democratic New Hampshire Sen. Maggie Hassan also expressed concern about Lindh’s release in a letter last week to the federal Bureau of Prisons. “We must consider the security and safety implications for our citizens and communities who will receive individuals like John Walker Lindh who continue to openly call for extremist violence,” they wrote. The bureau defended itself Thursday in a statement that said Lindh’s release followed federal laws and guidelines. It said it works closely with outside agencies “to reduce the risk terrorist offenders pose inside and outside of prisons,” and added that no radicalized inmate has returned to federal prison on terrorism-related charges. Moazzam Begg, a former detainee at Guantanamo, now serves as director of outreach for London-based CAGE, which supports the rights of those accused of terror-related crimes. He said the criticism over Lindh’s early release is misguided. If anything, Begg said, Lindh was imprisoned too long. He noted that many of the other Taliban fighters who were sent to Guantanamo as enemy combatants were released much earlier. As for Lindh’s letter in support of the Islamic State, Begg noted that it was written four years ago and that Lindh might not have had full knowledge of the group’s atrocities from behind bars. “Nobody really knows what his views are right now in 2019,” he said. In a statement, Begg said: “It is now time for him to be allowed to restart his life in peace and freedom.” "|"Convict known as the ‘American Taliban’ released after 17 years in prison"|"2019-05-23T08:49:14-0400"|"American Taliban,Taliban,John Walker Lindh,John Walker Lindh release,al-Qaeda,Afghan war,Mike Pompeo,news,world,lindh,taliban,Lindh,release,begg,letter",

Taiwan’s Parliament passed a bill last week that endorsed same-sex marriage, although the measure could complicate President Tsai Ing-wen’s bid for re-election next year. More than 360 same-sex couples married on Friday, according to government data, after years of heated debate over marriage equality that has divided the self-ruled and democratic island. Twenty couples queued at a marriage registration office in downtown Taipei, where rainbow flags were on display alongside stacks of government-issued, rainbow-themed registration forms. “I feel very lucky that I can say this out loud to everyone: I am gay and I am getting married,” said Shane Lin, a 31-year-old baker who, with his partner, were the first couple to register in the Taipei office. “I am extremely proud of my country Taiwan,” a tearful Mr. Lin said. The euphoria and emotion within the island’s gay community was on display as newlywed couples walked down a rainbow-coloured carpet in a nearby park, watched by families and friends as well as diplomats and reporters. Chi Chia-wei, an activist who brought a case to Taiwan’s constitutional court that led to a landmark court ruling on same-sex marriage in 2017, congratulated the couples. “This is the right that we deserved from a long time ago,” he said, draped in a giant rainbow flag that symbolizes the colours of the international gay movement. “As a beacon in Asia, I hope Taiwan’s democracy and human rights could have a ripple effect on other countries in Asia,” he added. Supporters also celebrated on social media, sharing posts with rainbow colours. Friday’s celebration followed a years-long tussle over marriage equality that culminated in the 2017 declaration by the constitutional court giving same-sex couples the right to marry, and setting a deadline of May 24 for legislation. Marriage equality was backed by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), but the measure could complicate President Tsai’s bid for a second term in elections next year. Conservative groups that oppose same-sex marriage said the legislation disrespected the people’s will. America’s de facto embassy in Taiwan called the island’s quest for equality “an inspiring journey and an example for the entire world.” “Only in a democracy such as Taiwan’s can human rights and civil rights be protected and nurtured,” the American Institute in Taiwan wrote on its Facebook page. Same-sex marriage is not recognized by Hong Kong and neighbouring China, which regards Taiwan as a wayward province to be returned to the fold by force, if necessary. It marks another milestone in Taiwan’s development as one of the region’s more liberal societies, in contrast with China’s strongly autocratic government. Across the strait, many Chinese congratulated Taiwan’s newlywed same-sex couples on platforms such as Weibo, China’s version of Twitter. “For once I thought the legalization of same-sex marriage in Taiwan would impact on the Chinese government, making them heed our appeals,” one Weibo user said. “But then I found the shock actually makes the government more scared, stepping up their crackdown on us.” "|"Taiwan celebrates Asia’s first same-sex marriages as couples tie knot"|"2019-05-24T07:05:02-0400"|"LGBTQ,same sex marriage,taiwan lgbt marriage,marriage equality,taiwan,gay,gay marriages,asia,marriage,rights,Taiwan,court,island,government,couple", 
"103"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-swedish-activist-greta-thunberg-demands-climate-action-as-students/"|"Anna Ringstrom Clement Rossignol"|"Swedish teenage activist Greta Thunberg urged European politicians on Friday to focus on a climate crisis instead of “bickering,” as children walked out of classes around the world to back her demands for urgent action to curb carbon emissions. With the 28 countries of the European Union voting to choose the bloc’s next parliament this week, the 16-year-old Thunberg said the threat of societal breakdown posed by runaway climate change overshadows every other campaign issue. “If the EU were to decide to seriously fight the climate crisis, it would mean a decisive global change. And the EU election should reasonably only be about this. But it isn’t. Not at all,” Thunberg told thousands of supporters gathered in Kungstradgarden square in Stockholm’s banking district. “This election campaign is about politicians bickering with other politicians about other issues that in a bigger perspective won’t be of any significance at all,” she said. By 1600 GMT, at least 300,000 young people had joined the strike in more than 1,780 cities in 128 countries, according to an early tally on the website of the Fridays for Future movement, a network of young climate protesters. The numbers were expected to climb significantly as protesters gathered in North and South America and more rallies were added to the count. An estimated 1.5 million young people took part in a previous global school strike on March 15. Climate change has moved up the political agenda this year, with fears among young, first-time voters that they will bear the brunt of global warming spurring a wave of support for Green candidates. But much of the debate during European campaigning has focused on issues such as immigration and austerity, rather than exploring how society might convert to a low-carbon economic model in time to avert the grimmest climate scenarios. Thunberg has emerged as an iconic figure since she began her protest for climate action alone in August outside the Swedish parliament. She has won a nomination for a Nobel Peace Prize, featured on the cover of Time magazine and travelled Europe by train to lambaste senior figures in government and industry. Children, teenagers and adults who had felt powerless in the face of the climate crisis have rallied behind the Fridays for Future movement in the hope of forcing politicians and business leaders to heed the warnings of scientists. “We are putting pressure on the governments and we want them to act fast and now,” said David Wicker, 14, who joined some 7,500 young protesters in Brussels. Young people who took time off school to protest on Friday urged adults to heed calls by climate activists for a global general strike on Sept. 20. In Paris, Celia Benmessaoud, 15, held up a sign saying “There’s Is No Planet B,” and said she hoped the school strike would change the world – echoing hopes voiced by participants from India, Turkey and Gambia to countries across Europe. Earlier, schoolchildren and students had kicked off the protests in New Zealand and Australia. “I’m worried about all the weather disasters. Every time we have huge a bushfire here another animal might go extinct,” said Nina Pasqualini, a 13-year-old at a rally in the Australian city of Melbourne that was led by the civil disobedience movement Extinction Rebellion. “The government isn’t doing as much as it should. It’s just scary for younger generations,” she said, holding up a placard seeking to stop a proposed new coal mine in Australia. Global carbon emissions hit a record high last year, despite a warning from the U.N.-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in October that output of the gases will have to be slashed over the next 12 years to stabilize the climate. Global warming caused by heat-trapping greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels has already led to droughts and heatwaves, melting glaciers, rising sea levels and floods, scientists say, and climate models project that the fallout could worsen. Sophie Hanford, a national organizer in New Zealand, and the Melbourne organizers said they anticipated a huge turnout at the general strike planned for September. “There’ll definitely be more. This is only the beginning,” Hanford said on New Zealand’s Breakfast television show.

More than 120 climbers scaled Everest on Thursday, but some of them were caught in the crowd of people on the slopes, leading to exhaustion, dehydration and death, the officials said. Hiking officials say between five and ten climbers die on Mount Everest in an average climbing year. Two women from India were among those who died. They were named as Anjali Sharad Kulkarni, 54, from the commercial capital of Mumbai, and 49-year-old Kalpana Das, from the eastern state of Odisha. Both died while descending from the summit, which is 8,850-metres high. The Indian man who died, also while descending, was Nihal Ashpak Bagwan, 27, from India’s western city of Pune. “Bagwan died of dehydration, exhaustion and tiredness after being caught in the jam of climbers,” said Keshab Paudel of the Peak Promotion hiking agency that handled the climber’s logistics. “We don’t know for how long the jam lasted nor how many climbers were clogged by a single line near the summit,” Mr. Paudel said. Lhakpa Sherpa of another agency, Arun Treks and Expeditions, said his client, Ms. Kulkarni, died of weakness while coming down to Camp IV on the South Col of Everest. The deaths were confirmed by Mira Acharya, an official of Nepal’s tourism department. Nepal has issued permits to 379 climbers on Mount Everest in the season, which ends this month. The Nepali guide fell sick and died on Friday, officials said without giving details. Another Nepali guide perished on nearby Mount Makalu, they said, also without providing more information. A total of 17 climbers have died or are missing on different Himalayan peaks in Nepal, seven of them Indians, since the start of the climbing season in March. On the Tibetan side of the mountain, there have been additional casualties, though, it wasn’t immediately clear how many. A member of a Swiss team died at 8,600 metres on the Tibetan side of the mountain on Thursday, according to Everest blogger Alan Arnette, who cited a Swiss operator, Kobler & Partner. The climber’s full name has not been released. “The winds have returned, plus the routes are extremely crowded on both sides, due to few summit weather windows this spring,” Mr. Arnette said on his blog.

"105"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-irans-foreign-minister-in-pakistan-amid-tensions-with-us/"|"Kathy Gannon Amir Vahdat"|"Iran’s foreign minister lashed out at U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday during a critically timed visit to Pakistan amid a simmering crisis between Tehran and Washington and ahead of next week’s emergency Arab League meeting called by Saudi Arabia over the region’s tensions. The remarks by Mohammad Javad Zarif were the latest in a war of words between him and Mr. Trump. The Iranian diplomat on Friday assailed the President for his tweet earlier this week warning Iran not to threaten the United States again or it would face its “official end.” “Iran will see the end of Trump, but he will never see the end of Iran,” Mr. Zarif was quoted by Iran’s semi-official Fars new agency as saying during a visit to Islamabad. Tensions have ratcheted up recently in the Mideast as the White House earlier this month sent an aircraft carrier and B-52 bombers to the region over a still-unexplained threat it perceived from Iran. And on Thursday, the Pentagon outlined proposals to the White House to send military reinforcements to the Middle East to beef up defences against Iran. Mr. Trump said on Friday the United States will bolster its military presence in the Middle East with an additional 1,500 troops. He said the troops would have a “mostly protective” role. The administration had notified Congress earlier in the day about the troop plans. The forces would number “roughly” 1,500 and would deploy in the coming weeks, “with their primary responsibilities and activities being defensive in nature,” according to a copy of the notification obtained by the Associated Press. Their mission would include protecting U.S. forces already in the region and ensuring freedom of navigation, the notification said. The purpose of Mr. Zarif’s visit to Pakistan, where he held talks with his Pakistani counterpart Shah Mehmood Qureshi and Prime Minister Imran Khan, was not made public. But there has been speculation that Iran is looking to Islamabad and its close relationship with the Saudis to help de-escalate the situation. In a statement following meetings with Mr. Zarif, Mr. Khan said “Pakistan was prepared to use its friendly relations in the region to help lower tensions among brotherly countries and promote peace and stability in the region. … War is not a solution to any problem.” Mr. Zarif has been criticized this week by Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who named him and President Hassan Rouhani as failing to implement the leader’s orders over Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Mr. Khamenei had claimed the deal had “numerous ambiguities and structural weaknesses” that could damage Iran. Separately, the official Iranian news agency IRNA quoted Mr. Zarif in Islamabad as warning of anarchy if world powers don’t unite to stop what he called U.S. aggression – Iran’s official parlance for Washington’s pressure on Tehran. The crisis takes root in the steady unravelling of the nuclear deal, intended to keep Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. The accord promised economic incentives in exchange for restrictions on Tehran’s nuclear activities. The Trump administration pulled the United States out of the deal last year, and subsequently reimposed and escalated U.S. sanctions on Tehran – sending Iran’s economy into freefall. Mr. Khamenei’s criticism of Mr. Zarif signalled a hard-line tilt in how the Islamic Republic could react amid Mr. Trump’s maximalist pressure campaign. Iran declared earlier this month that the remaining signatories to the deal – Germany, France, Britain, China and Russia – have two months to develop a plan to shield Iran from U.S. sanctions. On Monday, Iran announced it had quadrupled its production capacity of low-enriched uranium, making it likely that Tehran will soon exceed the stockpile limitations set by the nuclear accord, which would escalate the situation further. Several incidents have added to the crisis. On Thursday, Saudi Arabia said Yemen’s Iran-aligned rebels again targeted an airport near its southern border with a bomb-carrying drone. The Saudi military said it intercepted the drone, while the rebel Houthis said it struck a Patriot missile battery at the airport. The Houthis have claimed three times in recent days to have targeted the airport, which is also home to a military base. It comes after the Houthis last week targeted a Saudi oil pipeline in a co-ordinated drone attack. Pakistan was quick to condemn the attacks and promised Saudi Arabia, a staunch ally, its full support. The kingdom this week announced a US$3.2-billion deferred oil and gas payment package for energy-strapped Islamabad. With neighbouring Iran, Pakistan walks a fine line and their relationship is sometimes prickly. Islamabad has little leverage with Washington, although relations between the two have improved since Pakistan expressed readiness to help move talks between the Afghan Taliban and Washington forward. IRNA also reported that Mr. Zarif came to Pakistan with a proposal to link Iran’s port of Chabahar on the Arabian Sea with Pakistan’s Gwadar port, mostly being developed by China as part of the multibillion-dollar One Road project that will connect the Arabian Sea with China. The proposal is unexpected because Pakistan’s rival India has been Iran’s partner in developing Chabahar while Iran’s key regional rival, Saudi Arabia, has been in talks to develop an oil refinery facility at Pakistan’s Gwadar, though no agreements have been signed. Meanwhile, Oman’s Foreign Ministry said it was working to “ease the tensions” between Iran and the United States. The ministry in a series of tweets on Friday morning attributed the comments to Yusuf bin Alawi, the sultanate’s minister of state for foreign affairs, and cited an interview in Asharq al-Wasat, the London-based newspaper owned by a Saudi media group long associated with the al-Saud royal family. In the interview, bin Alawi warns war “could harm the entire world if it breaks out.” He doesn’t confirm any current Omani mediation but says both Washington and Tehran realize the gravity of the situation. Oman’s Sultan Qaboos bin Said spoke last week by telephone with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Oman, a country on the eastern edge of the Arabian Peninsula, has long been an interlocutor of the West with Iran. The U.S. held secret talks in Oman with the Iranians that gave birth to the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.

"106"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-trump-administration-to-invoke-emergency-to-sell-arms-to-saudi-arabia/"|"Matthew Lee Susannah George"|"The Trump administration on Friday invoked a rarely used provision in federal law to bypass congressional review of arms sales to Saudi Arabia, citing threats the kingdom faces from Iran. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo notified Congress of the decision to use an emergency loophole in the Arms Export Control Act to move ahead with sales of US$7-billion in precision guided munitions, other bombs and ammunition and aircraft maintenance support to Saudi Arabia, along with the United Arab Emirates and Jordan, without lawmakers’ approval. In his notification, Mr. Pompeo said he had made the determination “that an emergency exists which requires the immediate sale” of the weapons “in order to deter further the malign influence of the government of Iran throughout the Middle East region.” He said the transfers “must occur as quickly as possible in order to deter further Iranian adventurism in the Gulf and throughout the Middle East.” Mr. Pompeo’s move follows President Donald Trump’s announcement that the United States plans to send 1,500 additional U.S. troops to the Middle East as part of a buildup in response to an unspecified threat from Iran. It also comes as the administration has actively courted close ties with Saudi Arabia over congressional objections, notably following the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a U.S.-based columnist for The Washington Post, by Saudi agents in October. Mr. Khashoggi’s slaying, coupled with increasing concerns about civilian casualties resulting from a Saudi-led coalition’s military operation against Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, prompted lawmakers to block about US$2-billion in arms sales to the kingdom for more than a year. Last month, Mr. Trump vetoed legislation that would have ended U.S. military assistance for the Saudi-led war in Yemen. Critics of the Saudi campaign quickly denounced Friday’s step. Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the Senate foreign-relations committee, said the administration did not cite a specific legal or practical reason for using the loophole other than Iran. “I am disappointed, but not surprised, that the Trump administration has failed once again to prioritize our long term national security interests or stand up for human rights, and instead is granting favours to authoritarian countries like Saudi Arabia,” Mr. Menendez said in a statement. Democratic Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, who earlier this week warned against bypassing Congress, said the administration was only declaring an emergency because lawmakers would have blocked the transfers. “President Trump is only using this loophole because he knows Congress would disapprove of this sale,” Mr. Murphy said. “There is no new ‘emergency’ reason to sell bombs to the Saudis.” The law requires Congress to be notified of potential arms sales, giving the body the opportunity to block the sale. But the law also allows the president to waive that review process by declaring an emergency that requires the sale be made “in the national security interests of the United States.” Mr. Menendez and Mr. Murphy said they would challenge the decision but it was not immediately clear how they might do that. “With this move, the president is destroying the productive and decades-long working relationship on arms sales between the Congress and the executive branch,” Mr. Menendez said. “The possible consequences of this decision will ultimately threaten the ability of the U.S. defence industry to export arms in a manner that is both expeditious and responsible.” The chairman of the foreign relations committee, Republican Senator Jim Risch of Idaho, said he was “reviewing and analyzing the legal justification for this action and the associated implications.” There is precedent for using the emergency exemption for arms sales to Saudi Arabia. President Ronald Reagan invoked it in the 1980s and both Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush used it for sales before the 1991 Gulf War and the 2003 Iraq war.

"107"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-at-least-eight-people-injured-after-explosion-in-lyon-officials-say/"|""|"A “low force” blast hit a busy pedestrian street Friday in the French city of Lyon, injuring seven people as it shattered the glass from a refrigerated shop cooler in a bakery, a local official said. France’s anti-terrorist office opened an inquiry into the blast and the anti-terrorism prosecutor, Remy Heitz, went to Lyon. The interior minister also was on site, and soldiers secured the area. France is jittery over a spate of attacks in recent years, some of them deadly, carried out by people ranging from extremist attackers to mentally unstable individuals. Five people were killed Dec. 11 in an attack on the Christmas Market in Strasbourg, in eastern France. The alleged killer, Cherif Chekatt – killed by police – had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group. French media quoted the mayor of Lyon’s second district, Denis Broliquier, as saying that an image of the man who deposited a sack or suitcase that apparently exploded was captured by surveillance cameras. Two news TV stations, BFMTV and CNews, showed a blurry image of a man on a bicycle that they said was the suspect. Broliquier, the district mayor, told BFMTV he arrived minutes after the 5:30 p.m. explosion at the bakery chain Brioche Doree in Lyon’s central Presqu’ile area, which lies between the Rhone and Saone rivers that run through France’s third-largest city. “What I saw was a refrigerated cooler in the Brioche Doree, whose windows had been shattered. It was the windows ... that superficially injured the people who were 1, 2 or 3 metres (yards) away,” Broliquier said. “But the fridge itself wasn’t that damaged, which means the device had low force,” Broliquier said, downplaying the incident. “It’s not the apocalypse ... There’s no danger. There’s no risk.” He said authorities had cordoned off the street but had not evacuated residents. Authorities would not confirm French media reports that the blast was caused by an exploding package. French President Emmanuel Macron called the explosion an “attack” during a live interview about the European Parliament elections that run through Sunday. The mayor and Macron sent their sympathies to the injured, some of whom were taken to the hospital and others just went home. Resident Jean-Pierre, who lives above the bakery and didn’t give his last name, told BFMTV the noise from the explosion was “deafening” but it didn’t cause the walls to shake. He said a window shattered and there was some debris on the street. Some victims sustained leg injuries and no wounds were life-threatening, Kamel Amerouche, the regional authority’s communications chief, told The Associated Press. Earlier, French officials said eight people were wounded, but later lowered the figure to seven. The women’s World Cup soccer tournament is scheduled to start in France on June 7. Lyon will host the semi-finals, and then the final on July 7. Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said in a tweet that he has sent instructions for Lyon authorities to strengthen “the security of public sites and sporting, cultural and religious events.” French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe cancelled an appearance at a European elections-related meeting in Paris due to the Lyon explosion.

"108"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-emotional-british-pm-theresa-may-resigns-over-brexit-failure-i-have/"|"Paul Waldie"|"When Theresa May took over as Britain’s Prime Minister in July 2016, she described herself as a “bloody difficult woman” and vowed; “Brexit means Brexit and we will make a success of it.” Nearly three years later, Ms. May has been driven out of office by her own party, done in by a failure to deliver on Brexit and a leadership style many Conservative colleagues felt had become robotic and uncompromising. With the Tories plunging in most opinion polls and her Brexit agreement with the European Union in tatters, Ms. May had little choice but to resign. “I have done everything I can to convince MPs to back that deal. Sadly, I have not been able to do so,” she said in an emotional address outside No. 10 Downing Street on Friday. With tears welling up in her eyes, Ms. May expressed her “deep regret” at not delivering Brexit and added: “I will shortly leave the job that it has been the honour of my life to hold. The second female Prime Minister, but certainly not the last. I do so with no ill-will, but with enormous and enduring gratitude to have had the opportunity to serve the country I love.” She will formally step down as party leader on June 7, clearing the way for a leadership race that’s expected to conclude in mid-July. She’ll remain Prime Minister until the new leader is in place. The contest to succeed her is already underway with several cabinet ministers launching campaigns. Her departure does little to ease the Brexit turmoil. The United Kingdom is set to leave the EU on Oct. 31 and the country is now more likely to leave without any agreement on trade, transportation, banking and a host of other issues. The front runner to replace Ms. May is former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, a harsh critic of the Prime Minister’s Brexit strategy who supports a no-deal Brexit and trading with Europe on World Trade Organization terms. “We will leave the EU on October 31, deal or no deal,” Mr. Johnson said Friday. “The way to get a good deal is to prepare for a no deal.” Ms. May’s downfall was largely due to her inability to form a national consensus on Brexit and breach the long-standing divide within the Conservative Party between Euroskeptics who want to cut all ties with the EU and Europhiles who want to keep some links. She’s the fourth consecutive Conservative prime minister to be felled by the Europe issue, after Margaret Thatcher, John Major and David Cameron. It all began so promisingly for her. She became Tory leader by acclamation just weeks after Mr. Cameron resigned as prime minister in the wake of the Brexit referendum, which saw 52 per cent of voters back leaving the EU. She’d earned a reputation as a dogged, if stodgy, cabinet minister and Conservative Members of Parliament saw her as the steady hand needed to fulfill the referendum result. And while she rarely showed much vision or personality, her background as the only child of a vicar and a diabetic who took insulin injections up to five times a day gave her a human dimension that seemed to resonate with people. She even talked openly after taking office about her inability to have children and her bookish childhood, where the most outrageous thing she ever did was run through a field of wheat, much to the annoyance of farmers. At first, she took a tough line on Brexit, insisting that the U.K. would leave the EU single market and customs union, which allow for the free movement of goods and services. She drew a series of red lines and ruled out any Norway-style option, which would keep the U.K. in some EU institutions. “There will be no attempts to remain inside the EU," she said boldly. But her plans seemed vague and she kept her strategy largely under wraps, even from her cabinet. By catering mainly to Euroskeptic Tories, she also alienated other Tory MPs and opposition parties who might have been open to a compromise. Explainer: Where are we at with Brexit? A guide Read the full text of Theresa May's statement In March 2017, she triggered the EU exit mechanism, known as Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which launched a two-year negotiating period and put the U.K. on course to leave the bloc by March 29, 2019. Then she gambled and called a snap election. It proved to be a disastrous move. Ms. May looked awkward on the campaign trail and failed to connect with voters who were far more concerned with other issues than Brexit. She squandered a 21 point lead in the polls and the Tories lost their majority in the House of Commons. Instead of the “strong and stable” leadership she promised, Ms. May scrambled to form a minority government with the support of Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party, or DUP. From then on, her Brexit strategy became muddled and bogged down by increasing criticism from Euroskeptic Tory MPs who feared she was drifting away from a hard Brexit. By the time she struck a deal with the EU in November 2018, she’d agreed to a customs arrangement, a two-year transition period and a provision that would keep the Irish border open by aligning Northern Ireland to EU regulations. For many Tories and the DUP, that wasn’t their idea of Brexit and they joined the opposition in voting it down in Parliament. Ever more isolated, Ms. May pressed ahead, determined to tweak the agreement to win over critics. But it was rejected two more times by the House of Commons and she had to seek an extension to the March 29 deadline, something she repeatedly said she wouldn’t do. Last month, she reached out to the Opposition Labour Party to find a way out of the impasse, but it was too little too late and only infuriated more Tory MPs. “I do think it went wrong for her almost immediately because she made the decision to go for a much harder Brexit than would have been necessary to pull the country, and indeed Parliament, together behind her,” said Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London. “From that moment on she was doomed.” As Prime Minister, he added, “you need to be much faster on your feet and much more emotionally intelligent than I think she as a politician has ever shown herself to be.” Tony Travers, director of the Institute of Public Affairs at the London School of Economics and Political Science, said Ms. May waited too long to seek a coalition. Her decision early on “to effectively say, the 52 per cent who voted leave mattered and the other 48 can go away” was a grave miscalculation. Ms. May "clearly is not cutout for flexible, sensitive negotiations.” There’s little indication that Mr. Johnson will have any more success. EU leaders have said they will not renegotiate the deal and most MPs oppose a no-deal Brexit. But the rise of the newly formed Brexit Party, under the leadership of arch Euroskeptic Nigel Farage, has spooked many Tories and pushed them toward backing a no-deal exit. That includes Lance Forman, a life-long Conservative who now supports the Brexit Party. Ms. May “was just the wrong person right from the start,” said Mr. Forman, who said that Ms. May voted to remain in the EU. “You have to believe in [Brexit], otherwise you are not going to be able to carry people with you in a tough negotiation. And you’ll never negotiate as well if you don’t believe in it.” "|"Why May finally pulled the plug and what it means for Brexit"|"2019-05-24T05:44:53-0400"|"Theresa May,Britain,Brexit,EU,European Union,resignation,Prime Minister,Boris Johnson,Brexit deal,brexit,deal,ms may,Ms May,minister,tory",

Television footage broadcast by private channel NDTV showed people jumping off the top floor of the Takshashila building or trying to escape by climbing down, as thick smoke billowed out. Most of the dead were students who had been attending class at a tutoring centre housed in the building, according to the spokesman for the office of Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani. “The fire started near the staircase, so they could not get down,” Joint Commissioner of Police Harikrishna Patel said, adding that all of the dead were aged below 20 years. The blaze, likely caused caused by an electrical short circuit, started between 3.45-4.00 pm local time and spread rapidly, the commissioner said. Television footage showed people trying to grab a large banner on the side of the building as they plummeted down. Chief Minister Rupani has ordered an inquiry into the incident and asked Mukesh Puri, principal secretary of the urban development department, to submit a report within three days, the spokesman for his office said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Twitter he was thinking of the bereaved families. “Extremely anguished by the fire tragedy in Surat,” Mr. Modi said. “May the injured recover quickly,” he said, adding he had instructed authorities to help those affected.

"110"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-spanish-parliament-suspends-four-jailed-catalan-lawmakers/"|"Paul Day Belen Carreno"|"Spain’s lower house of parliament on Friday suspended four jailed separatist lawmakers who are on trial over their role in Catalonia’s failed independence bid in 2017. The four men were elected on April 28 in a national election that delivered a deeply fragmented parliament. Catalonia’s independence drive has overshadowed Spanish politics for years and is a major test for Pedro Sanchez’s Socialists after they won last month’s election but fell short of a majority. The jailed Catalans’ appearance in parliament on Tuesday, along with a 24-strong contingent of far-right lawmakers, led to a rowdy opening session. Citing Spanish legislation and advice from the house’s legal experts, parliamentary speaker Meritxell Batet, told reporters on Friday: “Based on all these legal elements, we have to automatically declare that their rights as lawmakers are suspended.” Ms. Batet, a Socialist, had over the past days insisted that the decision, which right-wing parties said should have come much faster, would not be political. Oriol Junqueras, Jordi Sánchez, Jordi Turull and Josep Rull are on trial on charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds relating to an independence referendum and subsequent unilateral declaration of independence by Catalonia in 2017. The Madrid government had banned the referendum and imposed direct rule on the northeastern region for a period. The defendants deny the charges and say the trial is an act of political repression. It was not immediately clear what would happen to the four lawmakers’ seats: It is up to them to decide if they want to leave them empty or if they would rather resign and pass the positions to fellow politicians. If the seats are left empty, this could work in favour of acting Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez as he would not need the backing of the Catalans to secure a second term as premier due to the numerical shift in parliament. Ms. Batet said she had asked parliament’s legal experts to look into the impact of Friday’s decision on the number of seats. The Catalan separatists reacted promptly. “Denying the presumption of innocence ... does not solve anything. From jail and as an elected deputy, I’m still betting on dialogue and democracy,” Jordi Sanchez said on Twitter. Catalonia’s former leader Carles Puigdemont, who is in self-imposed exile in Belgium, said: “On Sunday, we must respond there where it hurts most: in the polls!” Spain votes in European Union, regional and local elections on Sunday.

"111"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-north-korea-says-nuclear-talks-wont-resume-unless-us-changes/"|"Kim Tong-Hyung"|"North Korea said Friday that nuclear negotiations with the United States will never resume unless the Trump administration moves away from what Pyongyang described as unilateral demands for disarmament. The statement by an unnamed North Korean foreign ministry spokesman published in state media was the country’s latest expression of displeasure over the stalled negotiations as it continues to press Washington to soften its position on enforcing sanctions against the North’s crippled economy. It came as U.S. President Donald Trump prepares to travel to Japan this weekend for a summit with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in which the North Korean nuclear issue will likely be high on the agenda. In the statement carried by Pyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency, the North Korean spokesman accused the United States of deliberately causing February’s collapse of talks between Mr. Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un with unilateral and impossible demands. “We hereby make it clear once again that the United States would not be able to move us even an inch with the device it is now weighing in its mind, and the further its mistrust and hostile acts toward the DPRK grow, the fiercer our reaction will be,” the statement said, referring to North Korea’s formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. “Unless the United States puts aside the current method of calculation and comes forward with a new method of calculation, the DPRK-U.S. dialogue will never be resumed and by extension, the prospect for resolving the nuclear issue will be much gloomy,” the statement added. The United States has said the talks between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim broke down because of North Korean demands for sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of its nuclear capabilities. Mr. Kim has since declared that the Trump administration has until the end of the year to come up with mutually acceptable terms for a deal. Friday’s statement follows two separate launches of short-range missiles earlier this month, which ended a pause in North Korea’s ballistic missile launches that began in late 2017 and was seen as measured brinkmanship aimed at increasing pressure on Washington without actually causing the negotiations to collapse. North Korea has also strongly protested the recent U.S. seizure of a North Korean cargo ship that had been involved in banned coal exports and demanded the vessel to be immediately returned. After the collapse of the Trump-Kim summit, North Korea also significantly slowed the pace of its engagement with South Korea, which has been eager to improve bilateral relations and help revive discussions between Washington and Pyongyang. South Korea earlier this week vowed to push ahead with plans to resume large-scale humanitarian aid to the North. But it’s unclear whether any aid package from South Korea would influence the behaviour of North Korea, which has been demanding much bigger concessions from Seoul, such as the resumption of inter-Korean economic projects currently blocked by U.S.-led sanctions against Pyongyang.

"112"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-suspect-arrested-in-brake-pulling-incidents-on-new-york-subway-police/"|"Emma G. Fitzsimmons Ali Watkins"|"The case of the mysterious disruptions in the New York City subway system, caused by someone pulling emergency brakes, may have been solved: A man was arrested Friday and charged in one of the incidents. Police are now looking into whether he committed dozens of other similar acts in recent months that have upended the lives of thousands of riders. Isaiah Thompson, 23, of Brooklyn, was arrested on charges of reckless endangerment and criminal trespassing. Mr. Thompson was accused of riding on the back of a subway train on the No. 2 line Tuesday in Manhattan and of activating the train’s brakes, the police said. Thompson may have also been responsible for another incident May 16, which involved riding outside a B train and exposing himself to passengers on the platform, police said. He was also charged with public lewdness for the second incident. Subway officials have said they believed the brake-pulling incident Tuesday might have been tied to a broader pattern of mayhem in recent months in which one person – or possibly a group of people – had pulled the brakes on trains dozens of times, delaying hundreds of trains and affecting thousands of riders. It was not immediately clear if the police believed that Mr. Thompson was solely responsible for the dozens of brake pullings or were still searching for other culprits. The public hunt for the subway brake puller began this week. After reports of cascading rush-hour delays on two subway lines in Manhattan on Tuesday night, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said that it was the work of a repeat offender. There had been internal reports going back months noting that a man had gained access to the controller’s chair at the rear of a train and had pulled the emergency brake. The New York Police Department said the saboteur had pulled about 40 emergency brakes since February. The subway authority’s president, Andy Byford, called the behaviour dangerous and the culprits “morons.” “It’s stupid,” Mr. Byford said this week. “It’s dangerous. It’s selfish. And it’s got to stop.” He also said he wanted to ban the culprit from the subway. Subway officials said the culprit was endangering subway riders, track workers and himself. Riders on stalled trains could have a medical emergency, and subway tracks are notoriously dangerous because of the third rail, a steel column that carries 600 volts of electricity. After pulling a brake, the saboteur would flee onto the tracks.

Paul Whelan was arrested at the end of December at a Moscow hotel, where he was attending a wedding. He was charged with espionage, which carries punishment of up to 20 years in prison in Russia. Mr. Whelan denies the charges of spying for the United States that his lawyers said stem from a sting operation. One of the lawyers has said his client was handed a flash drive that had classified information on it that he didn’t know about. The court ruled on Friday that the Michigan resident, who also holds British, Irish and Canadian citizenship, be kept behind bars for three more months. Mr. Whelan told reporters in court that he has been threatened and subjected to “abuses and harassment” in prison. “I haven’t had a shower in two weeks. I can’t use a barber, I have to cut my own hair,” a visibly agitated Mr. Whelan said from the defendant’s dock. “This is typical prisoner-of-war isolation technique. They’re trying to run me down so that I will talk to them.” Andrea Kalan, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, said Friday that the American officials are disappointed with the ruling, arguing there is “no evidence of any wrongdoing.” “The mature, civilized course would be to let Paul go home to his elderly parents, who are wondering if they’ll see their son alive again,” Ms. Kalan said. Rights activist Eva Merkachova, who is authorized to visit Moscow prisons, told the RIA Novosti news agency on Friday that the prison administration at the Lefortovo detention centre, where Mr. Whelan is being kept, did not let her speak to the American because they were speaking English. She said she and another activist were told by a prison guard that they can only speak Russian on the premises and that Lefortovo refused to let in a certified translator. Mikhail Fedotov, chairman of the Russian presidential council for human rights, told Russian news agencies that members of his council will look into Mr. Whelan’s complaints.

According to Kabul police chief’s spokesman, Basir Mujahid, the bomb was concealed in the microphone used to deliver the sermon. The prayer leader, Maulvi Samiullah Rayan, was the intended target, the spokesman added. No militant group immediately claimed responsibility but both the Taliban and the Islamic State group regularly stage attacks in the country’s capital. The Kabul neighbourhood where the bombing took place is dominated by ethnic Pashtuns, most of whom are Sunni Muslims and who make up the backbone of the Taliban movement. U.S. Army spokesman Lt. Ubon Mendie confirmed that five Romanian NATO soldiers were injured in southern Kandahar late on Friday but offered no details. Kandahar was the former heartland of the Taliban, who ruled Afghanistan until their ouster in December 2001 by U.S.-led coalition forces. Meanwhile, a car bombing wounded 12 people late on Thursday also in the southern city of Kandahar. Provincial council member Yousaf Younasi said the bombing targeted insurgents from neighbouring Pakistan’s secessionist Baluchistan Liberation Army. It was the second attack in recent years to target the group in Kandahar’s posh Aino Mina residential area, he said. Last year, a suicide bomber blew himself up there, killing five Baluch separatists, including the mastermind behind the attack last November on the Chinese Consulate in Pakistan’s port city of Karachi that killed four people — two police officials and two civilians. Pakistan has struggled with the years-long insurgency in Baluchistan where the separatists demand a greater share of the region’s wealth and autonomy from Islamabad. The separatist group also claimed responsibility for an attack earlier this month on a luxury hotel in the Pakistani port city of Gwadar on the Arabian Sea. Most of the residents in the hotel were Chinese nationals involved in the development of the port. Kandahar’s provincial police chief, Tadin Khan, said there was no evidence that Baluch insurgents were the target of the explosion, which he said also wounded four children.

"116"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-israels-netanyahu-returns-election-favours-from-trump-putin-with/"|"Mark MacKinnon"|"As Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was campaigning for re-election this spring – eventually winning a fifth term even as prosecutors were preparing to indict him on corruption allegations – he was boosted by two of his closest friends on the international stage: U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Now, he’s paying the two men back with gifts that will last longer than Mr. Netanyahu’s new four-year term in office: a town in the Golan Heights named after Mr. Trump; and a monument in Jerusalem to the tragedy that shaped Mr. Putin’s life, the Second World War siege of Leningrad. Mr. Trump was accused of meddling in Israel’s April 9 election by announcing – while hosting Mr. Netanyahu in the White House two weeks before the vote – that the United States would become the first country to recognize Israel’s annexation of the Golan Heights, which it seized from Syria in a 1967 war and annexed in 1981. Ten days later, Mr. Putin delivered his own assist to Mr. Netanyahu’s campaign when Russian special-forces troops operating in Syria recovered and delivered the remains of Zachary Baumel, an Israeli soldier who had gone missing in Lebanon in 1982, and whose fate had long been a national concern. Mr. Netanyahu flew to Moscow to personally thank Mr. Putin, whom he referred to as a “dear friend.” The two episodes helped seal Mr. Netanyahu’s reputation as a master diplomat and boosted one of his main arguments for re-election: that only he and his personal relationships with world leaders could safely guide Israel in a time of turbulent international relations. Mr. Netanyahu, who is still in the process of forming a new government, hasn’t forgotten the helping hands he received during an election race that nearly saw him forced from the prime minister’s office by Benny Gantz, the popular former chief of Israel’s army. “All Israelis were deeply moved when President Trump made his historic decision to recognize Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights,” Mr. Netanyahu said in a video message shortly after his win. “I intend to bring to the government a resolution calling for a new community on the Golan Heights named after President Donald J. Trump.” It’s not yet known which Golan town will bear Mr. Trump’s name, but Israel’s new parliament, where nationalist right-wing parties hold a majority of seats, seems certain to make Mr. Netanyahu’s proposal law. Canada, like the rest of the international community, considers the Golan Heights to be occupied Syrian territory, its status to be determined only by a peace treaty between the two countries. A yet-to-be-built train station in Jerusalem, the closest one to Judaism’s sacred Western Wall, will also be named after Mr. Trump in honour of his decision to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. It was another provocative and pro-Israeli move, given that both Israelis and Palestinians claim the Holy City as their capital. “He knows how to play on the vanities of the people he wants to have a relationship with. He knows the little touches,” Mr. Netanyahu’s biographer, Anshel Pfeffer, said of his subject, in an interview with The Globe and Mail. “Even if you’re not of his political camp, you see a lot of leaders who warm to Netanyahu because this is a politician who knows how to be a national leader.” Diana Buttu, a former adviser to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, accused Mr. Netanyahu of “pandering” to Mr. Trump in hopes the United States would continue to back his right-wing government. “What’s next? Naming a settlement in the West Bank after Trump, after Trump agrees to allow Israel to annex the West Bank?” Ms. Buttu asked, referring to Mr. Netanyahu’s promise during the election campaign to annex some or all of the 121 Jewish settlements in the West Bank, which Israel also captured in the 1967 war. Mr. Netanyahu’s thank-you to Mr. Putin is in many ways even more personal. During his pre-election visit to Moscow, Mr. Netanyahu invited the Russian leader to visit Jerusalem later this year to attend the opening of a monument to the Siege of Leningrad, a curious addition to the skyline of a city already replete with sacred sites. Preserving the memory of the 872 days during which Leningrad was surrounded and starved – but which never surrendered to the Nazis – is deeply important to Mr. Putin, a native of Leningrad, which is now called St. Petersburg. Mr. Putin’s older brother, Viktor, still an infant at the time, died of diphtheria during the siege and Mr. Putin’s mother, Maria, almost died of starvation. Mr. Putin was born in 1952 in a Leningrad that was still recovering from the loss of an estimated 1.2 million people during the long battle to hold off the Nazis. The only problem with Mr. Netanyahu’s invitation to Mr. Putin is that a Leningrad memorial doesn’t yet exist in Jerusalem. Haim Ben Yakov, the head of the Euro-Asian Jewish Congress, a lobby group that promotes better ties between Russia and Israel, told The Globe that while a design for the eight-metre-high memorial has been chosen – it will look like a twisting, burning torch, with an image of the angel from the spire of St. Petersburg’s Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral on one side and a Star of David on another – a location has not yet been approved by Jerusalem city council. Mr. Ben Yakov said his group was hoping to see the monument built near the Israeli President’s official residence in the city. He said that, since tens of thousands of Jews died in the battle for Leningrad, it was appropriate for Jerusalem to have a memorial to the siege. But he acknowledged that modern-day politics was also a motivator. “It will certainly help us to strengthen ties between Russia and Israel. Russia has great influence in the Middle East and is involved in political processes. Therefore, good relations between Russia and Israel are important,” he said in a telephone interview. Mr. Putin’s 2015 decision to deploy the Russian military to Syria and his country’s relatively warm ties with Iran, have made the Israel-Russia relationship a critical one for Mr. Netanyahu. Contacts between Mr. Putin and Mr. Netanyahu have helped ensure that Israeli warplanes can operate over Syria, where they have repeatedly struck at pro-Iranian forces, without being targeted by the formidable Russian anti-aircraft batteries stationed in the country. Zeev Elkin, Israel’s Minister for Jerusalem Affairs – and a key booster of the Israel-Russia relationship, who accompanied Mr. Netanyahu on his pre-election trip to Moscow – made it clear that the monument was being built specifically to draw Mr. Putin to the city and to deepen the Russian leader’s attachment to Israel. In an interview, Mr. Elkin said that the Leningrad memorial would be built by summer, but he added that it wouldn’t formally open to the public until the Russian leader made room in his calendar for a visit to Jerusalem. “The day [Mr. Putin] decides to come will be the day we open it.” "|"Israel’s Netanyahu returns election favours from Trump, Putin with monumental thank yous"|"2019-05-26T09:55:28-0400"|"Israel,U.S.,United States,Russia,Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,President Donald Trump,President Vladimir Putin,Leningrad monument second world war,town named after Trump Israel,israel,jerusalem,russia,leningrad,netanyahu,trump",

The Brexit Party was launched in April by arch eurosceptic Nigel Farage, who played a key role in the 2016 referendum which saw 52 per cent of voters support leaving the European Union. Mr. Farage set up the party to serve as a protest vote at the government’s handling of Brexit and he has been adamant that the United Kingdom should leave the EU without a withdrawal agreement and trade along World Trade Organization rules. That message appears to have resonated across the country. Initial results on Sunday showed the Brexit Party won 21 of the U.K.’s 73 seats in the European Parliament and was leading in several more. The Conservatives had won just two seats and the party’s share of the popular vote had dropped by around 20 per cent from the last European election in 2014. Further results will be announced Monday. "It looks like we have a big win for the Brexit Party which I’m pleased about,” Mr. Farage told reporters on Sunday. The rise of the Brexit Party has spooked the Conservatives who are in the midst of a leadership contest after Prime Minister Theresa May announced on Friday that she will resign as party leader on June 7. Ms. May has been dogged by complaints from fellow Tories that she couldn’t deliver Brexit and that a withdrawal agreement she struck with the EU was a sellout. She has also been forced to seek repeated extensions to the deadline for Britain to pull out of the EU and the current date is Oct. 31. The fact that Britain even participated in the European elections has infuriated many Tories because the country should have been out of the bloc by now. The leading candidates to replace Ms. May come from the hard Brexit wing of the party and many are echoing Mr. Farage in calling for Britain to leave without a deal. “I will fight for a fairer deal in Brussels … if not I will be clear, we will leave on WTO terms in October,” one contender, former Brexit minister Dominic Raab, told the BBC on Sunday. Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who is considered the front-runner, has also indicated that he would back a no-deal departure. Another senior cabinet minister, Environment Secretary Michael Gove, joined the race on Sunday. Mr. Gove co-chaired the Vote Leave campaign with Mr. Johnson in 2016 and the two clashed in the last leadership race. Mr. Gove torpedoed Mr. Johnson’s run for the leadership in 2016, by initially backing his colleague and then announcing his own candidacy and criticizing Mr. Johnson. Both eventually dropped out and Ms. May won. Mr. Gove is considered a Brexit hard-liner but he has supported Ms. May’s deal and, on Sunday, he said reaching an agreement “is ultimately better for all of us.” There was some good news on Sunday for parties that support the U.K. remaining in the EU. The Liberal Democrats, which have called for a second referendum on Brexit, is on track to finish second to the Brexit Party. The Green Party and Scottish Nationalists, which also want Britain to remain, were also headed for an increased number of seats. However, the Labour Party’s vote has plummeted by at least 15 per cent and the party is expected to finish third. The party has suffered from an inability to explain its position on Brexit, Labour MP Emily Thornberry said on BBC.

Iraqi foreign minister, Mohammed al-Hakim, made the offer Sunday during a joint news conference in Baghdad with visiting Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif. “We are trying to help and to be mediators,” said al-Hakim, adding that Baghdad “will work to reach a satisfactory solution” while stressing that Iraq stands against unilateral steps taken by Washington. In recent weeks, tensions between Washington and Tehran soared over America deploying an aircraft carrier and B-52 bombers to the Persian Gulf over a still-unexplained threat it perceives from Tehran. The U.S. also plans to send 900 additional troops to the 600 already in the Mideast and extending their stay. The crisis takes root in President Donald Trump’s withdrawal last year of the U.S. from the 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers that capped Iran’s uranium enrichment activities in return to lifting sanctions. Washington subsequently reimposed sanctions on Iran, sending its economy into free fall. Trump has argued that the deal failed to sufficiently curb Iran’s ability to develop nuclear weapons or halt its support for militias throughout the Middle East that the U.S. says destabilize the region, as well as address the issue of Tehran’s missiles, which can reach both U.S. regional bases and Israel. Zarif, who was been on a whirlwind diplomatic offensive to preserve the rest of the accord, insisted that Iran “did not violate the nuclear deal” and urged European nations to exert efforts to preserve the deal following the U.S. pullout. Speaking about the rising tensions with the U.S., Zarif said Iran will be able to “face the war, whether it is economic or military through steadfastness and its forces.” He also urged for a non-aggression agreement between Iran and Arab countries in the Gulf. The Shiite-majority Iraq has been trying to maintain a fine line as allies Tehran and Washington descended into verbal vitriol. The country also lies on the fault line between Shiite Iran and the mostly Sunni Arab world, led by powerhouse Saudi Arabia, and has long been a battlefield in which the Saudi-Iran rivalry for regional supremacy played out. The mediation offer by al-Hakim, Iraq’s foreign minister, echoed one made Saturday by Mohamad al-Halbousi, the Iraqi parliament speaker. Al-Hakim also expressed concern for Iran’s spiralling economy. Iranians make up the bulk of millions of Shiites from around the world who come to Iraq every year to visit its many Shiite shrines and holy places and their purchasing power has slumped after Trump reimposed the sanctions. “The sanctions against sisterly Iran are ineffective and we stand by its side,” al-Hakim said. Meanwhile, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani suggested the Islamic Republic could hold a referendum over its nuclear program. The official IRNA news agency said Rouhani, who was last week publicly chastised by the country’s supreme leader, made the suggestion in a meeting with editors of major Iranian news outlets on Saturday evening. Rouhani said he had previously suggested a referendum to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in 2004, when Rouhani was a senior nuclear negotiator for Iran. At the time, Khamenei approved of the idea and though there was no referendum, such a vote “can be a solution at any time,” Rouhani was quoted as saying. A referendum could provide political cover for the Iranian government if it chooses to increase its enrichment of uranium, prohibited under the 2015 nuclear deal. Earlier last week, Iran said it quadrupled its uranium-enrichment production capacity though Iranian officials made a point to stress that the uranium would be enriched only to the 3.67% limit set under the deal, making it usable for a power plant but far below what’s needed for an atomic weapon. Rouhani’s remarks could also be seen as a defence of his stance following the rare public chastising by the supreme leader. Khamenei last week named Rouhani and Zarif – relative moderates within Iran’s Shiite theocracy who had struck the nuclear deal – as failing to implement his orders over the accord, saying it had “numerous ambiguities and structural weaknesses” that could damage Iran. Khamenei, who has final say on all matters of state in Iran, did not immediately respond to Rouhani’s proposal of a referendum. The Islamic Republic has seen only three referendums since it was established in 1979 – one on regime change from monarchy to Islamic republic and two on its constitution and its amendments. Also in Tehran, acting commander of the country’s powerful Revolutionary Guard said any negotiations with the U.S. would be fruitless. Gen. Ali Fadavi said it would be like having “negotiations with Satan.” Meanwhile, Yemen’s Iranian-allied Houthi rebels launched a bomb-carrying drone Sunday targeting another airport in Saudi Arabia. Col. Turki al-Maliki, a spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition fighting against the Houthis, said that the military intercepted and destroyed the drone targeting its Jizan Regional Airport. Saudi state TV published images of debris it said belonged to the drone. The rebels have attacked another airport multiple times and a critical Saudi oil pipeline in recent days amid the heightened tensions between the U.S. and Iran.

"120"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-british-climber-dies-on-mount-everest-descent-as-death-toll-of/"|"Jeff Lewis"|"Documentary filmmaker Elia Saikaly embarked for the summit of Mount Everest last week in pitch black and frigid temperatures. He was far from alone. Hundreds of climbers, seeking to take advantage of favourable conditions, pushed forward around the same time, creating a traffic jam along an oxygen-starved leg of the ascent called the death zone. There were reports of at least eight deaths as of Sunday after a three-day ordeal in which about 500 climbers were scheduled to summit the Himalayan peak, the world’s tallest. The aftermath marks an especially deadly turn in this year’s climbing season – Nepali officials peg the death toll in the Himalayas at more than a dozen – that has also revived debate about the sustainability of the region’s tourism industry. “It’s incredibly surreal. It’s very disturbing as well,” said Mr. Saikaly, who lives in Ottawa. Mr. Saikaly spoke Sunday from Kathmandu, one day after flying out of Everest base camp after his third successful summit in eight expeditions. He was filming four women, who were attempting the feat for the first time, for a documentary project. The group, two from Lebanon, one from Oman and another from Saudi Arabia, made it up and back unscathed, he said. But the trip was harrowing. Mr. Saikaly said they left Camp 4, located about 8,000 metres above sea level, on May 22 at 9:30 p.m. local time after waiting for roughly six weeks. They were accompanied by four Sherpa guides, who carried oxygen and survival gear for the group, as well as camera equipment. In the dark, headlamps provided the only light. The temperature dipped to minus 35 C. Within 20 minutes, the group passed two Sherpa guides as they lowered a man down the mountain on a stretcher. They soon passed another climber who was delirious and screaming. Higher still, they stepped over a dead body someone had rigged up to a safety anchor. At another point, Mr. Saikaly implored an exhausted climber to turn back. The deadly traffic jam is the result of a confluence of factors, Mr. Saikaly said. More people have flocked to the Nepali side of Everest after China began limiting climbers from the Tibetan side of the mountain. Nepal’s tourism ministry has issued a record 381 permits this year, up from 346 last year. He said some hopefuls also scrimp on logistics, which can cost up to US$65,000 a person to start. Climbers also watch the same weather information for low winds and warm temperatures, conditions that can prove fleeting and often spark a rush. Mr. Saikaly said he fears the death toll could rise as visitor numbers increase and tour operators proliferate. “It’s not sustainable. And what’s happening, whether it’s through the media or social media, people are seeing images of Everest, they’re seeing people standing on top of the world. I don’t think they realize how serious it is," he said. “Everest is quite manageable with the right support on a good day. But when things go wrong, most people are not prepared to survive up there on their own.” Mr. Saikaly, 40, first attempted to climb the mountain at the urging of Sean Egan, a University of Ottawa professor who died in 2005 at 63 while attempting to become the oldest Canadian to ascend to the summit. Mr. Saikaly completed the ascent in 2010 and again in 2013, but turned back in 2014 and again in 2015, years that also proved deadly. Mr. Saikaly, whose father is Lebanese, said his film, The Dream of Everest, will chronicle the story of the four women from the Middle East as they train and prepare to climb the summit. He said he hopes the documentary will break stereotypes and also serve as a cautionary tale for would-be climbers. But he added he won’t be returning to the mountain. “I fear for the future of how much bigger of a disaster it could be in comparison to what’s gone on this year,” he said. "And that’s really scary.” "|"‘It’s not sustainable’: Canadian documentarian details experience of climbing Everest during deadly traffic jam"|"2019-05-26T20:29:35-0400"|"mount everest,climb,death,filmmaker,harrowing,Documentary,mountain climbing,summit,people,climber,everest,mountain,media,time,saikaly", 
"121"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-pro-europe-parties-prevent-a-populist-surge-in-the-eu-elections/"|"Eric Reguly"|"The rising populist and nationalist parties fell well short of overturning the political order in Brussels even though they, along with the Green parties riding the wave of worry about climate change, made gains in the European Union parliamentary elections. Sunday night’s exit polls in the EU’s biggest countries suggest that the largely Euroskeptic populist parties, which are bent on reversing the integration project, will be able to declare only a partial victory when the overall results are tallied. While there is little doubt those parties, some of them on the anti-migrant hard right, will have a louder voice in the more fragmented new parliament, their power will be insufficient to block EU legislation. They helped deprive the traditional centre-right (Christian Democrat) and centre-left (socialist) groups of their combined majority for the first time in the parliament’s 40-year history. But most voters still embraced pro-EU parties, with the pro-business liberal democratic groups and the Greens making solid gains amid higher-than-usual voter turnouts. Propelled by young voters, the Greens emerged as the second-largest party in Germany, more than doubling their tally in the 2014 EU election as they filled the vacuum left by the free fall of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), the junior partner in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s ruling coalition. Still, populist, Euroskeptic parties, inspired by disrupters such as U.S. President Donald Trump and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, performed well in a few countries, notably Italy and France. In Italy, which last year elected Western Europe’s first populist government, Matteo Salvini’s fiercely Euroskeptic, anti-migrant League party was on course to take at least 27 per cent of the vote, more than triple its 2014 results, putting it well ahead of its coalition partner, the anti-establishment Five Star Movement. In France, Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (formerly National Front), with about 23 per cent of the vote, narrowly beat President Emmanuel Macron’s pro-Europe En Marche party, which has been hobbled by the endless Gilets Jaunes anti-government protests. Ms. Le Pen, who fared poorly in the 2017 national elections, styled her campaign as a referendum on Mr. Macron’s term in office and called Sunday’s results a “victory for the people.” The EU elections were the most tumultuous in the parliament’s 40-year history. They came after the twin shocks of Brexit and the migration crisis, both of which triggered deep soul-searching in Brussels and in the capitals of the member states. They also fuelled the rise of the Euroskeptic parties, which argued that the European project was failing its citizens. Lingering austerity measures in Greece, Italy and elsewhere helped their cause. Mr. Macron said the elections came at “the most perilous moment for Europe since the Second World War.” While the elections are ostensibly about setting the political themes for the next five years for the EU and its institutions – including the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm – they also reflect political sentiment in the member states. The surging popularity of Mr. Salvini, who is Italy’s Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister, probably makes him Europe’s most powerful populist and virtually guarantees he will win the next Italian election. The crushing defeat on Sunday of Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras’s radical-left Syriza party seems to confirm the widespread belief that the conservative New Democracy party will win the Greek election, which is to be held by July. The European populists, especially those of the hard-right variety – Mr. Salvini, Ms. Le Pen, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Alexander Gauland of the Alternative for Germany, among others – billed the election as a clash of philosophies. On one side was the ever-closer-union vision of Mr. Macron, to the point the EU would have its own army and debt financing through common bonds, creating a “United States of Europe.” On the other was the “Europe of nations” touted by the Euroskeptic leaders, who want to see the EU hand back sovereignty to the nation states and close the borders to most migrants, especially Muslims. The Euroskeptic parties, however, became wary of leaving the EU after seeing the shambles of Brexit. They want to reform it from within, perhaps turning it into little more than a common market. In an interview with The Globe and Mail this year, Steve Bannon, the populist champion who was Mr. Trump’s campaign manager and chief strategist, said, “I have not met one politician in any of these sovereignist, nationalist populist parties who say they want out – no discussion of exit. They all want a massive reform of the EU – it’s Macron’s vision versus Orban’s and Salvini’s.” There were signs ahead of the election that the populists would struggle to make the breakthrough they cherished. Many polls placed migration atop the list of voters’ concerns, but the migration crisis has largely abated since Ms. Merkel opened the borders to a million migrants from Syria and elsewhere in 2015. Mr. Salvini has stopped most charity rescue ships from docking at Italian ports, greatly reducing the number of migrants crossing the Mediterranean from Libya. As the crossings diminished so, apparently, did the appeal of some of Europe’s far-right, anti-migrant parties. The polls that pointed to a populist surge appeared to discount young voters’ fascination with environmental issues, especially climate change. In the weeks before the election, the teenage Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg attracted thousands of young Europeans to rallies. Carsten Schneider, the German SPD’s chief whip, said his party’s election failure to highlight climate change was a grave mistake. “I think the main issue was climate change, and we didn’t succeed in putting that front and centre alongside the big social issues,” he said.

The rhino, named Tam, was about 30 years old and lived at a wildlife reserve in Sabah state on Borneo island since his capture in 2008, Christina Liew, state minister for tourism, culture and environment, said in a statement. The Sumatran rhino, the smallest species of rhinoceros, was declared extinct in the wild in Malaysia in 2015. Iman, a female captured in 2014, is now the only surviving member of the subspecies left in the country. Another female rhino, Puntung, died in captivity in 2017. Wildlife experts estimate that only about 30 to 80 Sumatran rhinos remain in the world, mostly on the Indonesian island of Sumatra and on the Indonesian side of Borneo. Their isolation, caused by habitat loss and poaching, means they rarely breed and may go extinct in a matter of decades, according to conservation group International Rhino Foundation. Since 2011, Malaysia has tried to breed the species in captivity through in vitro fertilization, but without success. Liew said Tam’s genetic material has been preserved for future attempts to reproduce Sumatran rhinos.

"123"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-uks-nigel-farage-demands-a-seat-at-brexit-talks-2/"|"Paul Waldie"|"The European election results in Britain have left the country as divided as ever over Brexit and piled more pressure on the Conservative government as it tries to find a way forward under a new prime minister. The nascent Brexit Party was the big winner of the election, taking 29 out of Britain’s 73 seats in the European Parliament. The party won nearly one-third of the popular vote and came first in every region in England and Wales outside of London. The result was a huge victory for Nigel Farage, the Euroskeptic who founded the party in April as a protest movement over the government’s handling of Brexit. He has campaigned for Britain to leave the EU without an agreement and trade with the bloc under World Trade Organization (WTO) terms. “We’re not just here to leave the European Union but to try and fundamentally change the shape of British politics, bring it into the 21st century and get a Parliament that better reflects the country,” Mr. Farage told supporters late on Sunday. He added to reporters that the party now has a mandate to become involved in shaping the government’s Brexit strategy. The rise of the Brexit Party has been a challenge for the ruling Conservatives, who had their worst showing in European elections in decades. The Tories won just four seats, down from 19 in the previous European vote in 2014, and saw their share of the popular vote drop to 9.1 per cent. The results come as the party launches a leadership race to find someone to succeed Prime Minister Theresa May, who announced on Friday that she will step down as leader on June 7. Ms. May had been dogged by complaints from fellow Tories for months that she couldn’t deliver Brexit and that a withdrawal agreement she struck with the EU was a sellout. She’d also lost party support after repeatedly seeking to extend the deadline for Britain to depart the EU. The new date is Oct. 31. The fact that Britain even participated in the European elections has infuriated many Tories because the country should have been out of the bloc by now. Many party members refused to campaign or backed the Brexit Party. The leading candidates to replace Ms. May, who will remain Prime Minister until a new leader is chosen in July, come from the hard Brexit wing of the party and many are echoing Mr. Farage in raising the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. “I will fight for a fairer deal in Brussels … if not I will be clear, we will leave on WTO terms in October,” one leading contender, former Brexit minister Dominic Raab, told the BBC on Sunday. Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who is considered the front runner, has also indicated that he would back a no-deal departure. "If we go on like this, we will be fired: dismissed from the job of running the country,” Mr. Johnson warned Tories in a newspaper column on Monday. “We can and must deliver. No one sensible would aim exclusively for a no-deal outcome. No one responsible would take no-deal off the table.” Mr. Johnson’s main rival is expected to be Environment Secretary Michael Gove who joined the race on Sunday. Mr. Gove co-chaired the Vote Leave campaign with Mr. Johnson ahead of the 2016 Brexit referendum and the two clashed in the last Tory leadership race in 2016. During that contest, Mr. Gove abruptly pulled his support for Mr. Johnson and then launched a rival campaign. Both eventually dropped out and Ms. May won by acclamation. Mr. Gove is considered a Brexit hardliner but he has supported Ms. May’s deal and on Sunday, he said reaching an agreement “is ultimately better for all of us.” On Monday, another senior cabinet minister, Home Secretary Sajid Javid, announced he was running for the leadership. Mr. Javid voted to remain in the EU in 2016 but now backs Brexit and said recently that there was nothing to fear from a no-deal exit. Many voters viewed the election as a referendum on Brexit, and the overall result revealed deep divisions. The two hard-Brexit parties – the Brexit Party and the United Kingdom Independence Party – won 35 per cent of the popular vote and dominated England outside of London. The parties that favour remaining in the EU – the Liberal Democrats, Scottish Nationalists, Greens, Change UK and Plaid Cymru in Wales – took 40 per cent of the vote and did well in Scotland and London. Those geographic patterns largely reflected the 2016 referendum where Scotland and London voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU and the rest of England voted to leave. The Labour Party did almost as badly as the Conservatives. Both parties spent weeks trying to agree on a Brexit deal but ultimately failed. Labour finished third in the European vote behind the Brexit Party and the Liberal Democrats with 10 seats, a loss of 10 from the 2014 vote. “We went into an election where the most important issue was, ‘What was our view on leaving the European Union?’ and we were not clear about it,” Labour MP Emily Thornberry told the BBC.

The economy grew 6.6 per cent in the three months to December – the slowest pace in five quarters – and the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FICCI) said the bigger worry was that domestic consumption was not growing fast enough to offset a weakening global economic environment. “The recent signs of slowdown in the economy stem not only from slow growth in investments and subdued exports but also from weakening growth in consumption demand,” FICCI said in a statement suggesting various measures the government could adopt in the next budget expected in a month. “This is a matter of serious concern and if not addressed urgently, the repercussions would be long term.” Modi – who won a thumping majority in the general election despite the agricultural sector’s economic woes, a shortage of jobs and the stuttering economy – takes oath of office on Thursday and will need a finance minister who can help navigate through the challenges facing the economy. Some of the issues are slowing industrial output and manufacturing growth, slumping car and two-wheeler sales, and a drop in airline passenger traffic. FICCI said the new government should cut corporate and individual taxes, expand a program of handing 6,000 rupees ($86) a year to poor farmers to boost consumption demand and consider tax concessions for export-oriented manufacturers. The Confederation of Indian Industry, another industry body, said it was crucial to reduce the income tax burden and expand the scope of investment allowance to all sectors, while higher incentives should be given to exporters. The FICCI also called for an interest-rate cut from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), as real interest rates have remained high for a long time with commercial banks reluctant to pass on the benefits of recent cuts. When Modi took power for the first time in 2014, global oil prices slumped. But as he gets set for a second term, rising oil prices could push the current account deficit higher. The body also said the trade war between the United States and China could further slow down global trade and hurt India’s already sluggish exports. “Amidst rising uncertainties and economic challenges on both the domestic and global front, there is an urgent need to re-energize the engines of growth and pump prime the economy,” FICCI said. “The upcoming budget … is an opportunity for the government to boost consumption and investments through appropriate fiscal stimulus and policies.” Government bureaucrats have started consultations with industry bodies, such as the FICCI, before the budget.

Spearheading that challenge is Italy’s Matteo Salvini, whose League party has become the driving eurosceptic force and wants to bring together like-minded parties scattered across several groups in the European Union legislature. The tough-talking deputy prime minister said on Monday he aimed to group 150 lawmakers and had discussed the matter with Marine Le Pen’s National Rally in France, Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party in Britain and Prime Minister Viktor Orban in Hungary. Provisional results give more than 170 seats, or 23 per cent of the 751-member assembly, to parties that sat in eurosceptic groups in the last parliament. That was up from 20 per cent, but was a smaller gain than some had expected for the far-right and left pro-European parties with a firm majority still. The push for a nationalist bloc is complicated by differences on big issues like asylum and relations with Moscow. At least, though, one of the three groupings in which they are currently divided looks set to disappear. After poor results by most of its members, the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy (EFDD) group – led by the U.K. Independence Party (UKIP) and Italy’s anti-establishment 5-Star Movement – will struggle to reach the threshold of seven national parties necessary to form a group in the EU assembly. In another possible boost to Salvini’s plan, Poland’s ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS), currently with the mildly eurosceptic European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group, said it was ready for talks on an alliance with the League . PiS has won 23 seats in the new assembly. Though the number of eurosceptic deputies looks insufficient to block legislation in a chamber that will remain dominated by centrist and liberal forces, the nationalists could punch above their weight on some issues with the right alliances. “There is a risk that some sectors of the EPP (mainstream European People’s Party) will be drawn further to the right by the stronger presence of the far right,” said Kenneth Haar, researcher at Corporate Europe Observatory, a campaign group. This, he said, would be most likely on issues concerning human rights and democracy. Orban, who with 52 per cent of the Hungarian vote won 13 seats in the EU parliament, is seen as the most likely to quit the EPP, from which his party has already been suspended over concerns on rule of law in Hungary. “If he decides to team up with Salvini and his group, it would send a big signal to the European pro-EU establishment,” said Mujtaba Rahman, of Eurasia Group consultancy. Italy’s former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, whose Forza Italia party has won eight seats in the EU chamber, has also repeatedly called for the EPP’s shift to the right. Vox, Spain’s new far-right party, could also side with Salvini’s group on some issues. Hampering that, however, are deep divisions among nationalist parties which stopped them mounting a meaningful challenge to pro-EU parties in the past legislature. Nationalists from eastern Europe have for long opposed Italy’s calls to share asylum seekers among EU states. Poland’s PiS is wary of Salvini and Le Pen’s cozy relations with Russia. And on economic policies, eurosceptics have widely differing views, with Salvini’s calls for more flexibility on fiscal rules being met with coldness by his Austrian allies of the far-right FPO. Eurosceptics’ rise is also partly due to the success of Farage’s Brexit Party, which with 29 seats is the largest in the new parliament. But it is likely to only be a temporary gain, as British deputies will have to quit once Britain leaves the EU on Oct. 31, unless a new extension is granted. Nationalists may however find improbable allies on specific issues, said Guntram Wolff, director of the Brussels-based think tank Bruegel. They could for instance end up siding with the leftists and the strengthened Greens on opposing new trade deals.

"126"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-baghdad-court-sentences-another-french-islamic-state-group-member-to/"|"Qassim Abdul-Zahra"|"The French former members of the Islamic State group were brought into the courtroom in Baghdad one after the other on Monday and made to sit inside a wooden cage in the middle. As they spoke in French, a government official typed up the translation into Arabic, which immediately appeared on a large screen behind the judge that the court could read. Mustafa Mohammed Ibrahim became the fourth French citizen to be sentenced to death by a Baghdad court for joining the Islamic State group that once controlled large parts of Syria and Iraq before its defeat. His trial comes as questions swirl about the legal treatment of thousands of foreign nationals formerly with the extremist group. Wearing a yellow uniform and plastic flip flops, Ibrahim, 37, told the judge, “I don’t understand the charges.” Judge Ahmad Mohammed responded: “Your charge is a terrorist crime.” The man who came from France to Syria to join the group in 2015, said he was the victim of its propaganda. The self-proclaimed caliphate had promised him a good life including money, work and a house. Jobless back in Europe, Ibrahim came to Syria via Turkey where he took religious lessons and weapons training. He then married a Moroccan widow with four children who later gave birth to his child. When the judge asked Ibrahim if he was guilty, his response was: “I am not guilty of carrying out any crimes. I am guilty because they brainwashed me. I am the victim of the Islamic State. I am not guilty.” “I am ready to help France in the fight against terrorism,” Ibrahim added. France said the Iraqi court has jurisdiction to rule in the cases, though a spokeswoman reiterated the French government’s opposition to the death penalty. The five Frenchmen on trial Monday – two were kept outside the courtroom – were among the 12 French IS fighters whom the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces handed over to Iraq in January. The Kurdish-led group spearheaded the fight against IS in Syria and has handed over to Iraq hundreds of suspected IS members in recent months. IS “terrorists must answer for their crimes in court,” said France’s foreign ministry spokeswoman, Agnes von der Muhll. As Monday’s proceedings opened, the first to appear was Ibrahim, who is from the Mediterranean city of Nice and of Tunisian origin. “I ask for forgiveness from the people of Iraq and Syria and the victims,” Ibrahim said before the judge who ordered him to remove his top in order to see if there were any signs of torture on his body. None were visible. “No matter what the sentence will be against me I want to go back to my country,” said Ibrahim. He added that he used to work as a driver back in France before joining IS. The judge sentenced Ibrahim to death. Asked by The Associated Press later why the sentencing happened so quickly, Mohammed said the “case was complete and ready for a verdict.” He added that regarding executions, Iraqi law sentences any member of the group to death whether the person “participates in fighting or not.” The second man brought into the courtroom was identified as Fadil Hamad Abdallah, 33, of Moroccan origin. Abdallah said he was subjected to torture while in detention. The judge referred him to a medical committee for investigation and postponed his next session until Sunday. The judge postponed the sentencing of the three other Frenchmen until next Monday. Three French IS fighters had already been sentenced to death on Sunday. Those convicted can appeal their sentences within a month. Human rights groups have criticized Iraq’s handling of IS trials, accusing authorities of relying on circumstantial evidence and often extracting confessions under torture. Nadim Houry, the Human Rights Watch’s director of its terrorism and counterterrorism program, said: “There are few rights for the defence and grave due-process issues – that’s deeply worrying, especially when combined with the death penalty. In-depth investigations are not being carried out.” Houry added that no one should be transferred to a country where there is a risk of torture. “We have visited Iraqi prisons and we’ve seen rampant torture, usually to extract confessions,” he said. Iraqi prosecutors say the 12 French nationals were parties or accomplices to IS crimes, and threatened the national security of Iraq. Simply belonging to the extremist group is punishable by life in prison or execution under Iraq’s counter-terrorism laws. In Paris, von der Muhll said France’s position is that adults detained in Iraq must be tried by the Iraqi justice system, as soon as it declares itself competent. “France respects the sovereignty of Iraqi authorities” she added, though she expressed her country’s opposition to the death penalty, “in principle, at all times and in all places.” "|"Baghdad court sentences fourth French Islamic State group member to death "|"2019-05-27T08:19:44-0400"|"Islamic State,France,Iraq,Baghdad court,Iraq death penalty,ISIS,news,world,iraq,judge,ibrahim,syria,france,death,group", 
"127"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-israel-moves-closer-to-a-new-election-as-netanyahu-struggles-to-form/"|"Jeffrey Heller"|"Israel moved closer towards a new election on Monday as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s efforts to form a government after last month’s national ballot remained deadlocked. In a preliminary vote, parliament decided to dissolve itself. In order to disperse and set an election date, legislators would still have to hold a final vote, likely to take place on Wednesday. Netanyahu, who heads the right-wing Likud party, has until 2100 GMT on Wednesday to put a government together, after being delegated the task by President Reuven Rivlin following the April 9 poll. In a televised address following the initial vote in parliament, Netanyahu pledged to continue pursuing coalition talks and said a new vote would be unnecessary and costly. “A lot can be done in 48 hours,” he said. “The voters’ wishes can be respected, a strong right-wing government can be formed.” In power for the past decade and facing potential corruption indictments, Netanyahu has struggled to seal an agreement with a clutch of right-wing, far-right and ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties that would ensure him a fifth term. Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing and is due to argue against the attorney-general’s intention to indict him on fraud and bribery charges at a pre-trial hearing in October. U.S. President Donald Trump weighed in on Netanyahu’s political woes in the face of political brinkmanship by the Israeli leader’s erstwhile ally, former defence minister Avigdor Lieberman. “Hoping things will work out with Israel’s coalition formation and Bibi and I can continue to make the alliance between America and Israel stronger than ever,” Trump tweeted, using Netanyahu’s nickname. “A lot more to do!” Although a second national election in the same year – unprecedented for Israel – would pose new political risks for Netanyahu, it would pre-empt Rivlin from assigning coalition-building to another legislator once Wednesday’s deadline expires. Divisions between Lieberman’s ultra-nationalist Yisrael Beitenu party and United Torah Judaism over a military conscription bill governing exemptions for ultra-Orthodox Jewish seminary students have plunged the coalition talks into stalemate. The five parliamentary seats that Yisrael Beitenu won in the April ballot are crucial to Netanyahu gaining a parliamentary majority. Likud took 35 of the legislature’s 120 seats, the same number as its main rival, the centrist Blue and White party, but had the pledged support of a bigger right-wing bloc. In a standoff with United Torah Judaism, Lieberman has demanded ultra-Orthodox must share other Israeli Jews’ burden of mandatory service. Ultra-Orthodox parties say seminary students should be largely exempt from conscription as they have been since Israel was founded in 1948. But some commentators and members of Likud have suggested Lieberman’s real motive is to ultimately succeed Netanyahu and lead Israel’s right-wing, using the conscription bill and coalition stalemate to weaken him politically. “Avigdor Lieberman’s only interest is to seize control of the national camp by toppling Netanyahu,” deputy foreign minister and Likud member Tzipi Hotovely told Army Radio. Lieberman, who resigned his defence post in Netanyahu’s outgoing cabinet last November over policy toward the Palestinian enclave of Gaza, said he was acting only out of principle. In his speech, Netanyahu welcomed the supportive remarks of Trump, with whom he has been in lock-step over policies toward the Palestinians and Israel’s Iranian foe. “He (Trump) is right,” he said. “We have an infinite number of things to do, security challenges … economic challenges.” But Netanyahu said he had failed “so far, including tonight” to persuade Lieberman “to avoid an election”.

"128"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-historians-educators-worry-d-day-is-losing-resonance-with-students-as/"|"Martha Waggoner"|"Kasey Turcol has just 75 minutes to explain to her high school students the importance of D-Day – and if this wasn’t the 75th anniversary of the turning point in the Second World War, she wouldn’t devote that much time to it. D-Day is not part of the required curriculum in North Carolina – or in many other states. Turcol reminds her students at Crossroads FLEX High School in Cary, North Carolina, that D-Day was an Allied victory that saved Europe from Nazi tyranny and that the young men who fought and died were barely older than they are. She sprinkles her lesson with details about the number of men, ships, and planes involved in the landing at Normandy while adding a few lesser-known facts about a Spanish spy and a deadly military practice conducted six months earlier in England. In the U.S. and other countries impacted by the events on June 6, 1944, historians and educators worry that the Second World War milestone is losing its resonance with today’s students. In France, which was liberated from German occupation, D-Day isn’t a stand-alone topic in schools. German schools concentrate on the Holocaust and the Nazi dictatorship. And despite having been part of the Allied Powers, in Russia, the schools avoid D-Day because they believe it was the victories on the Eastern Front that won the war. “History has taken a back seat” in the U.S. because of the focus on science and math classes, says Cathy Gorn, executive director of National History Day in College Park, Maryland. In the U.S., teaching about the Second World War varies from state to state. It’s often up to the teachers to decide how much time they want to give to individual battles like D-Day. California’s History-Social Science Framework, adopted in 2016, includes for sophomores an expansive unit on the Second World War that includes how the conflict was “a total war,” the goals of the Allied and Axis Powers and how the fighting was fought on different fronts. The unit also includes a section on the Holocaust. In New York, school officials are using the D-Day anniversary to review the curriculum and “make recommendations on how the current average time of 90 minutes of World War II study in a school year can be strengthened, expanded and mandated.” There are special programs available to immerse select students in the history of D-Day. For eight years, National History Day sent 15 pairs of students and teachers to Normandy to immerse them in the history of D-Day. The high school sophomores and juniors would research an individual soldier close to them – a family member or someone from their hometown – who died. On the last day, the group visited a cemetery where each student read a eulogy for their individual soldier. Teachers also have outside resources. The National World War II Museum offers an electronic field trip through D-Day and provides suggested lessons plans. In North Carolina, history is taught through “conceptual design” with connections to themes such as geography, economics and politics, said Meghan Grant, co-ordinating teacher for secondary social studies in Wake County schools. The lessons are based on a method of teaching social studies that was developed in 2013 and used by about half the states, said Larry Paska, executive director of the National Council for the Social Studies. Paska said it may focus on asking students a question like “What makes an event a turning point in the war?” Students then would use difference sources of evidence to back up their answer. As part of her D-Day lesson, Turcol tells her class of juniors and seniors that the Germans thought an attack from the Allied forces wouldn’t be possible. “It’s too stormy. It’s too risky,” she says. “And what do we do? Yeah, we find a glimmer of hope. On June 5, the skies kind of clear. The moon kind of shines. And we’re like, this is the moment. This is what is happening.” She tells students that Gen. Dwight Eisenhower kept D-Day plans on the “down low.” Turcol plays a few minutes of a documentary about D-Day to “show you the true humanity of the war,” she says. “You saw the German praying … asking for his mother, father, asking for this to be over. Not everybody is on the same message in Germany,” she says. “Everybody here is a father, a mother, a brother, a cousin, a friend. So every life matters.” Students in Europe also receive dramatically different lessons on D-Day depending on where they live. Because of Germany’s history, any hint of militarism remains a taboo. While battles like D-Day, Stalingrad and the Operation Barbarossa invasion of Russia might be mentioned briefly in schools, they tend to be lumped together in broad overviews of the war. Individual teachers do have leeway, however, to pursue topics that capture the attention of students. The curriculum is similar from state to state. In Berlin high schools, for example, curriculum guidelines include the history of the war under the overall focus on “the collapse of the first German democracy; Nazi tyranny,” which includes classes on Nazi ideology, resistance movements, the Holocaust and the Second World War. Similarly, Bavaria’s ninth grade curriculum focuses primarily on explaining how the Nazis came to power and their anti-Semitic ideology and genocidal policies, with the war taught briefly as part of their “expansion and conquest policies.” In the 11th grade, the focus is even more directly on the Holocaust, and the curriculum guidelines note specific dates to be learned, including the anti-Jewish “Kristallnacht” pogrom in 1938. The Russian narrative on D-Day has remained almost unchanged since the days of the Soviet Union. Historians and schoolbooks describe the invasion as a long-awaited move as happening after the course of WWII had already been shaped by Soviet victories in the battles of Stalingrad and Kursk and other battles on the Eastern Front. Even in the country where D-Day occurred, the assault doesn’t have a central, dominant place in the teaching of the Second World War. The history of 20th century conflict is taught in France as a theme and no longer as a chronological list of major battles. “We no longer teach as we did before, what we called ‘the history of battles,“’ says Christine Guimonnet, who teaches history at a high school west of Paris and is secretary general of the APHG, a French association of history and geography teachers. “Everyone will, of course, speak about June 6 because it was a major moment in the war, but we’re not going to spend a whole week on it. That’s not possible.” As long as they are still teaching the broader themes, French teachers may home in on specific events, like D-Day, to organize study projects and, if they have the budget, trips to Normandy beaches, museums or screenings of “The Longest Day,” a 1962 film about the events of D-Day. As cultural director at Normandy’s Caen Memorial, Isabelle Bournier deals daily with school groups that tour the museum. French children often aren’t familiar with the details of D-Day, partially because fewer families have relatives who lived through the war and can pass on their stories, she said. Students from Normandy are different from the broader French student population, she said. “All families are more or less impregnated by this history. It is part of us,” Bournier said.

The soldiers were driving back to base after picking up their salaries in the country’s western Farah province. They were travelling in a Humvee when the explosion took place on Sunday afternoon in the Bala Buluk district, said Shah Mahmmod Nahimi, a provincial councilman. “The blast was so intense that no one in the Humvee survived,” he added. Elsewhere, the Taliban targeted several checkpoints in northern Sari Pul province on Sunday night, killing four members of the security forces and wounding 22, said Zabiullah Amani, the provincial governor’s spokesman. The attacks took place on the outskirts of the provincial capital of Sari Pul and triggered gunbattles that lasted for hours, he said, adding that 15 Taliban fighters were also killed. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the Farah attack in a statement on their website but did not make any announcements about the Sari Pul attack. Meanwhile, a sticky bomb attached to a minibus carrying government workers in Kabul detonated on Monday morning, wounding 10 people, said police spokesman Ferdus Faramarz. One of the wounded was in critical condition. Arab Haidari, from the religious affairs ministry, said all the wounded are ministry’s employees who were on their way to work when the explosion took place. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. Both the Taliban and Islamic State militants regularly stage attacks in Kabul. On Sunday, gunmen shot and killed a prominent religious scholar, Mawlavi Shabir Ahmad Kamawi, in Kabul, and last week, a mosque bombing killed another religious scholar during Friday prayers, also in Kabul. Attacks have increased recently as Washington’s peace envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, presses ahead with talks with the Taliban, who refuse to negotiate directly with the Kabul government. The talks so far have focused on a timetable for U.S. troop withdrawal as well as Taliban guarantees that they won’t harbour terrorist groups or allow Afghanistan to be used as a staging ground for global terror attacks. Also Monday, the Defence Ministry celebrated the graduation of about 3,000 soldiers following their three-month training program with a ceremony at the Military Academy in Kabul.

"130"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-trump-says-a-deal-on-irans-nuclear-program-was-possible-as-sanctions/"|"Jeff Mason Malcolm Foster"|"U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday a deal with Iran on its nuclear programme was possible, crediting economic sanctions for curbing activities Washington has said are behind a spate of attacks in the Middle East. “I really believe that Iran would like to make a deal, and I think that’s very smart of them, and I think that’s a possibility to happen,” Trump said during a news conference with Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Tokyo. “It has a chance to be a great country with the same leadership,” Trump said. “We aren’t looking for regime change – I just want to make that clear. We are looking for no nuclear weapons.” In Tehran, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Iran was not seeking nuclear weapons, which its supreme leader had banned in an edict, adding on Twitter that U.S. policies were hurting the Iranian people and causing regional tensions. “Actions—not words—will show whether or not that’s @realDonaldTrump’s intent,” Zarif said. President Hassan Rouhani said in October the United States was seeking “regime change” in Iran, adding that the current U.S. administration was the most hostile that the Islamic Republic had faced in its four decades. Tensions have risen between Iran and the United States after this month’s attack on oil tankers in the Gulf region. Washington, a firm backer of Tehran’s regional rival Saudi Arabia, has blamed the attacks on Iran, which denies the accusations. The United States has deployed a carrier strike group and bombers to the and announced plans to deploy 1,500 troops to the Middle East, prompting fears of a conflict. Trump’s national security adviser John Bolton said on Saturday that the United States had “deep and serious” intelligence on threats posed by Iran, without providing details. Trump, on a four-day visit to Japan, welcomed Abe’s help in dealing with Iran after broadcaster NHK said Japan’s leader is considering a trip to Tehran as early as mid-June. Iran said a visit was unlikely in the near future. “I know for a fact that the prime minister is very close with the leadership of Iran, and we’ll see what happens,” Trump said. At his joint news conference with Trump, Abe said Japan would do what it can on the Iran issue. Trump last year withdrew the United States from a 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran, and is ratcheting up sanctions seeking to end Iran’s international sales of crude oil and strangle its economy. Japan was a major buyer of Iranian oil for decades before U.S. sanctions which Trump said were taking effect. “They were fighting in many locations,” he said of Iran. “Now they are pulling back because they have serious economic problems.” Bolton, who has spearheaded an increasingly hawkish U.S. policy on Iran, described recent bomb attacks on tankers off the United Arab Emirates and a pipeline pumping station in Saudi Arabia, as well as a rocket attack in Baghdad’s Green Zone, as “manifestations of concern” about Iran. Iran has distanced itself from the bombings and on Sunday, Zarif said his country will defend itself against any military or economic aggression.

Scientists say the southernmost portion of Southeast Alaska has been in a drought for the last two years, The Anchorage Daily News reported Sunday. The drought was upgraded last week to an extreme, or D3, drought, according to climatologists at the Fairbanks-based Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy. The designation is the second-highest category measured by the U.S. Drought Monitor — a national map updated weekly — and the first time that mark has been recorded in Alaska, officials said. The extreme drought area includes Ketchikan, Prince of Wales Island, Wrangell, and Metlakatla, officials said. Areas experiencing lesser “severe” and “moderate” droughts have also expanded. Droughts are different in the rainforest climate of Southeast Alaska than in other global locations, but precipitation is still drastically less than normal, said climatologist Rick Thoman. Ketchikan has averaged about 100 inches (254 centimetres) annually since 2017 and Metlakatla has had between 80 and 90 inches (203 and 229 centimetres.) “In the mass amount of the world that would be an immense amount of rain,” Thoman said. Storm paths have been a significant drought factor within the past two years by moving west toward the Bering Sea or south toward the Pacific Northwest, taking rain and snow with them, Thoman said. While this is the first extreme drought classification in Alaska, it is likely not the first in the region. Similar deficits were measured in the early 1990s, before the U.S. Drought Monitor was established, he said.

The nascent Brexit Party was the big winner of the election, taking 29 out of Britain’s 73 seats in the European Parliament. The party won nearly one-third of the popular vote and came first in every region in England and Wales outside of London. The result was a huge victory for Nigel Farage, the Euroskeptic who founded the party in April as a protest movement over the government’s handling of Brexit. He has campaigned for Britain to leave the EU without an agreement and trade with the bloc under World Trade Organization (WTO) terms. “We’re not just here to leave the European Union but to try and fundamentally change the shape of British politics, bring it into the 21st century and get a Parliament that better reflects the country,” Mr. Farage told supporters late on Sunday. He added to reporters that the party now has a mandate to become involved in shaping the government’s Brexit strategy. The rise of the Brexit Party has been a challenge for the ruling Conservatives, who had their worst showing in European elections in decades. The Tories won just four seats, down from 19 in the previous European vote in 2014, and saw their share of the popular vote drop to 9.1 per cent. The results come as the party launches a leadership race to find someone to succeed Prime Minister Theresa May, who announced on Friday that she will step down as leader on June 7. Ms. May had been dogged by complaints from fellow Tories for months that she couldn’t deliver Brexit and that a withdrawal agreement she struck with the EU was a sellout. She’d also lost party support after repeatedly seeking to extend the deadline for Britain to depart the EU. The new date is Oct. 31. The fact that Britain even participated in the European elections has infuriated many Tories because the country should have been out of the bloc by now. Many party members refused to campaign or backed the Brexit Party. The leading candidates to replace Ms. May, who will remain Prime Minister until a new leader is chosen in July, come from the hard Brexit wing of the party and many are echoing Mr. Farage in raising the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. “I will fight for a fairer deal in Brussels … if not I will be clear, we will leave on WTO terms in October,” one leading contender, former Brexit minister Dominic Raab, told the BBC on Sunday. Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who is considered the front runner, has also indicated that he would back a no-deal departure. "If we go on like this, we will be fired: dismissed from the job of running the country,” Mr. Johnson warned Tories in a newspaper column on Monday. “We can and must deliver. No one sensible would aim exclusively for a no-deal outcome. No one responsible would take no-deal off the table.” Mr. Johnson’s main rival is expected to be Environment Secretary Michael Gove who joined the race on Sunday. Mr. Gove co-chaired the Vote Leave campaign with Mr. Johnson ahead of the 2016 Brexit referendum and the two clashed in the last Tory leadership race in 2016. During that contest, Mr. Gove abruptly pulled his support for Mr. Johnson and then launched a rival campaign. Both eventually dropped out and Ms. May won by acclamation. Mr. Gove is considered a Brexit hardliner but he has supported Ms. May’s deal and on Sunday, he said reaching an agreement “is ultimately better for all of us.” On Monday, another senior cabinet minister, Home Secretary Sajid Javid, announced he was running for the leadership. Mr. Javid voted to remain in the EU in 2016 but now backs Brexit and said recently that there was nothing to fear from a no-deal exit. Many voters viewed the election as a referendum on Brexit, and the overall result revealed deep divisions. The two hard-Brexit parties – the Brexit Party and the United Kingdom Independence Party – won 35 per cent of the popular vote and dominated England outside of London. The parties that favour remaining in the EU – the Liberal Democrats, Scottish Nationalists, Greens, Change UK and Plaid Cymru in Wales – took 40 per cent of the vote and did well in Scotland and London. Those geographic patterns largely reflected the 2016 referendum where Scotland and London voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU and the rest of England voted to leave. The Labour Party did almost as badly as the Conservatives. Both parties spent weeks trying to agree on a Brexit deal but ultimately failed. Labour finished third in the European vote behind the Brexit Party and the Liberal Democrats with 10 seats, a loss of 10 from the 2014 vote. “We went into an election where the most important issue was, ‘What was our view on leaving the European Union?’ and we were not clear about it,” Labour MP Emily Thornberry told the BBC.

"134"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-austrian-lawmakers-pass-no-confidence-motion-against-chancellor-kurzs/"|"Francois Murphy"|"Austrian conservative Chancellor Sebastian Kurz suffered the biggest setback of his meteoric career on Monday as parliament voted the 32-year-old’s government out of office in the wake of a video sting that blew up his coalition with the far right. The star among Europe’s conservatives, known for his hard line on immigration, looked unassailable just two weeks ago. But then the leader of the far-right Freedom Party (FPO) was caught in a video sting, prompting him to step down and leading Mr. Kurz to call off their alliance. Mr. Kurz became the head of a caretaker government just days ago and hoped to use that position as a springboard to re-election, depicting himself as more of a victim of the current crisis than its enabler who brought the FPO into power. But the centre-left opposition said he shared the blame, and the FPO backed it. “Kurz gambled away his chances and, Mr Chancellor, you bear full responsibility,” the Social Democrats’ (SPO) deputy parliamentary faction head Joerg Leichtfried said in a speech to lawmakers, minutes before his party submitted a motion of no-confidence against Kurz’s government. The first successful no-confidence motion against an Austrian government since the country regained its independence in 1955 was passed when lawmakers from the Social Democrats and FPO stood in support. Together they control a majority of seats in the assembly. Kurz’s party holds a third of the seats. Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen must now nominate a new chancellor to put together a caretaker government able to last until the next election, widely expected to be held in September. While he could in principle choose Kurz again, that is highly unlikely. An elder statesman, like a retired president or senior judge, is the more probable. Van der Bellen said he would formally relieve the government of its duties at 11:30 a.m. (0930 GMT) on Tuesday but ask ministers to stay on for “a small number of days” until a solution for a new provisional government were found. Vice Chancellor Hartwig Loeger would lead until then, he said. Kurz had replaced outgoing FPO ministers with civil servants, arguing that even though he headed what was essentially a minority government, it represented stability in the wake of the video scandal and ahead of a parliamentary election widely expected to be held in September. He also pledged a full investigation into any crimes and wrongdoing arising from the footage in which FPO veteran Heinz-Christian Strache appeared to offer to fix government contracts for a woman posing as a Russian oligarch’s niece. Strache says he did nothing illegal. Vienna prosecutors say they are investigating “in multiple directions” in relation to the footage although they have declined to elaborate. Instead of seriously seeking to build bridges with the Social Democrats and other opposition parties, however, Kurz sought to strengthen his hand with a strong showing in Sunday’s European election, and he succeeded. Rather than punish his People’s Party for its 17-month alliance with the far right, voters rewarded it with a bigger share of the vote than in the 2017 election that brought Kurz to power. The Social Democrats (SPO), the biggest opposition party, were unable to capitalize on the video scandal and lost ground. “To topple the entire government a few months before an election is something no one in this country can understand,” Kurz told lawmakers the day after what he called his party’s “landslide” victory in the European Parliament vote. But that did not deter the SPO from bringing its motion of no confidence against Kurz. It argued that if any ministers were going to be replaced with civil servants to rebuild trust after the scandal it should be all ministers including Kurz. “Your actions have nothing to do with responsibility,” SPO leader Pamela Rendi-Wagner told lawmakers. Kurz had prepared his arguments ahead of the vote, saying he would once again seek a show of strength at the ballot box. “Parliament decided today but at the end of the day, in September, in a democracy the people decide,” he told a party rally in Vienna after the vote. “I am looking forward to that.” The FPO’s Herbert Kickl, whom Kurz forced out of his post as interior minister, forecast a different outcome. “This power grab is disgusting... And voters will decide about that, too, in September,” he told lawmakers.

"135"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-cppib-conducting-human-rights-checks-on-hikvision-other-chinese/"|"Nathan VanderKlippe David Green"|"Canada’s largest public pension manager has begun a new scrutiny of its investments, including its ownership stake in Chinese companies, as human-rights groups and U.S. lawmakers point to the role of China’s surveillance-equipment makers in enabling the monitoring and control of the country’s religious minorities. The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board says it is conducting new checks across its vast portfolio to identify companies with troubling practices – even as it continues to pursue a strategy of diversification with investments in China. “Companies that violate human rights aren’t positioned to succeed and have no place in any portfolio that exists to deliver risk adjusted returns over multiple generations. We are monitoring the practices of companies in this regard,” said Michel Leduc, global head of public affairs and communications at the CPPIB, in an e-mailed statement. In particular, he said, “the potential misuse of advanced technology is a concern.“ Mr. Leduc was responding to questions from The Globe and Mail about the CPPIB’s ownership of Chinese surveillance equipment companies that U.S. legislators want to blacklist for enabling state violations of human rights. All of this occurs as frictions between Canada and China have increased in recent months after the arrest of Chinese executive Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver, at the request of U.S. authorities, with China ostensibly retaliating by arresting two Canadians and blocking agricultural imports. The CPPIB, along with British Columbia Investment Management Corp. and Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, has stakes in a pair of companies whose technology has been used in China’s Xinjiang region, where authorities have built a powerful apparatus for monitoring and controlling a large Muslim population of Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other ethnic minority groups. Authorities in Xinjiang have used surveillance technology to track and control people in a sweeping anti-extremism campaign that has also seen an estimated one million people placed in internment centres for political indoctrination and skills training. Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co. Ltd. and Zhejiang Dahua Technology Co. Ltd. are major manufacturers of camera equipment that combines video surveillance with advanced computer technologies such as facial and gait recognition. Human Rights Watch, in a report this year titled China’s Algorithms of Repression, identified Hikvision as the winner of a contract to supply China’s Integrated Joint Operations Platform, which undertakes mass surveillance in Xinjiang. Hikvision is partly owned by China Electronics Technology Group, a state-owned military contractor. “Funds have to look into whether their investments are contributing to human-rights abuses,” said Maya Wang, the senior China researcher with the group and lead author of the report. “Surveillance companies like Hikvision are intertwined with the public-security apparatus in China, and there is understandably a lot of concern over their involvement not just in Xinjiang but in enabling authoritarian governments to commit human-rights abuses outside of China as well.” Hikvision also operates three systems integration companies and a construction company in the town of Hotan in southwestern Xinjiang, according to its 2018 annual report. “It reflects a vote of confidence if you’re investing in a company,” said Margaret McCuaig-Johnston, a senior fellow with the China Institute at the University of Alberta. For Canadian investors who own Chinese surveillance company stock, “it may be that these companies were not aware of how this technology was going to be used when they first invested in them. Perhaps it’s time that they took a second look.” Yet selling off stock should be a last resort, said Paloma Munoz Quick, a program director with the Investor Alliance for Human Rights. “Investors with holdings in Chinese companies involved in surveillance activities in Xinjiang should use their leverage to call on these companies to stop selling tools to the Chinese government that may be used to monitor and control the Muslim minority in the region,” she said. The CPPIB, which has actively pursued additional investment in China, owns $46-million in shares in Hikvision and $2-million worth of Dahua, according to a statement on foreign publicly traded equity holdings dated March 31. Both are among five companies that members of the U.S. Congress, citing human-rights concerns, have considered for inclusion on a list that would bar them from obtaining components from U.S. companies without special permission. The United States recently imposed similar requirements for Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. on security grounds. Other major Canadian pension investors also have stakes in China’s surveillance industry. Between 2017 and 2018, as reports began to emerge of arbitrary mass detentions of Uyghurs in Xinjiang, British Columbia Investment Management Corp. raised its public equity investments in Hikvision and other Shenzhen-listed Chinese companies supplying surveillance systems in the region. According to its investment inventory, BCI held more than $20-million in Hikvision shares as of March 31, 2017. One year later, BCI, which oversees $145.6-billion worth of assets, had raised its holdings in Hikvision to $37.9-million and committed a new investment of $4.2-million in Dahua. Over the same period, it also raised its exposure to Beijing Venustech Group, a provider of network security services whose clients have included arms of the Chinese military, from $43.2-million to $62.2-million. “After careful consideration, we respectfully decline the opportunity to discuss the details of our investment holdings,” BCI wrote in an unsigned e-mail from its communications account in response to questions from The Globe. Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ), an institutional investor that manages several public and parapublic pension plans and insurance programs, maintains a similar footprint. As of the end of December, 2018, CDPQ held shares worth $60.1-million in Hikvision, $19.6-million in Dahua and $17.7-million in Beijing Venustech, according to its annual report. CDPQ did not respond to a request for comment. Other major Canadian pension funds do not list specific holdings. The Alberta Investment Management Corp. said it does not own shares in Hikvision or Dahua. The Ontario Municipal Employees’ Retirement System and the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan did not respond to requests for comment. A number of private funds have also traded shares in the Chinese surveillance state. Investor documents show that CI Investments held $3.7-million in Hikvision via its emerging markets equity pool, while Calgary-based Mawer Investment Management had upwards of $50-million in Hikvision across its portfolio. “We no longer hold the company in any of our portfolios,” Mawer marketing manager Joanna Crozier said in an e-mail. “That company is not held in the emerging markets equity pool and is not held by any CI fund,” said Murray Oxby, vice-president of communications at CI Investments. The CPPIB has made China a key part of its diversification strategy, with plans to open an office there as its holdings of companies in greater China reach almost 10 per cent of its $392-billion in assets. That includes shares in other major Chinese companies that also do business in Xinjiang – builders, brewers, electrical utilities and rail manufacturers. The CPPIB holds stocks in thousands of companies through a quantitative program designed to secure an overall risk and return profile, rather than through individual investment decisions, Mr. Leduc said. “It is purely about extensive diversification across many sectors of the economy – and globally,” he said. Performing intensive background checks on each of those companies has been prohibitively expensive, but “we have sought, found and started to apply such tools earlier this year.” Still, he said, CPPIB intends to continue investing in China. “Global diversification is not a choice for CPPIB,” Mr. Leduc said. “Avoiding what will soon become the world’s largest economy (for us, ‘soon’ is the next decade, not the next quarter) would not be prudent and would not be consistent with our legislation.” David Green is a freelance writer.

A federal task force is being sent to Manaus in an effort to halt the violence. Prison clashes often spread rapidly in Brazil, where drug gangs have de facto control over nearly all jails. In January 2017, nearly 150 prisoners died during three weeks of violence in north and northeastern Brazil, as local gangs backed by Brazil’s two largest drug factions – the First Capital Command and the Red Command – butchered one another. A statement from the Amazonas state penitentiary department revised to 40 from an earlier 42 the number of deaths that took place on Monday and said authorities had regained control of the four prisons. No other details were provided. At least 15 inmates were killed at a jail in Manaus on Sunday, with authorities saying those who died were choked and stabbed to death. Brazil’s far-right President Jair Bolsonaro has vowed to regain control of the country’s prisons – along with building many more jails. But the vast majority of jails are administered at the state level. For decades they have been badly overcrowded and out of control of local authorities, essentially serving as recruiting centres for drug gangs.

Most of the victims were students at a Catholic elementary school who were lined up at the bus stop near Noborito Park in the city of Kawasaki when the man began slashing them with knives. Officials said police captured the attacker but he died at a hospital from a self-inflicted cut in his neck. Witnesses described a hellish scene: children and adults falling to the ground, some with their shirts soaked with blood, dozens of children running and screaming for help, and school bags and books scattered on the ground. “I heard a scream so I stopped and turned around to see what happened. It was not a normal tone of voice,” said Yasuko Atsukata. She said she saw one person collapse, and then another. “The colour of their white shirts turned red after they collapsed, then I understood they got stabbed.” In a nearby parking lot, a frightened-looking boy was in shock with scratches on his face, hands and legs, apparently from falling to the ground as he ran for his life. Police identified the attacker as Ryuichi Iwasaki, a 51-year-old resident of Kawasaki, and said they were still checking his occupation. The attacker’s motive wasn’t immediately known. Police found two more knives in the man’s knapsack in addition to the two he was holding, according to media reports. Iwasaki reportedly lived with his elderly uncle and aunt and was known as a trouble maker. A neighbour said Iwasaki repeatedly rang her doorbell early one the morning about a year ago and yelled at her husband that he had been hit by a tree branch sticking out from their yard, the Sankei newspaper reported. Kawasaki city official Masami Arai said most of the injured were students at Caritas Gakuen, a Catholic school founded by Soeurs de la Charite de Quebec, an organization of Catholic nuns in Quebec City in Canada. Arai said three of the injuries were serious. Kanagawa prefectural police confirmed 17 people were injured and three others had died, including the attacker. Police identified the two other fatalities as 11-year-old Hanako Kuribayashi and Satoshi Oyama, a 39-year-old government employee who was taking his child to the bus stop. Hospital officials said both had been slashed in the neck and the head. Caritas Chairman Tetsuro Saito said at a news conference that he was “struggling to fight back my anger.” “My heart is broken with pain when I think of the innocent children and their parents who send their children to our school with love who were victimized by this savage act,” he said. School officials said they will step up security measures at the school, including adding more security guards. But the incident raises questions about how schools can ensure the safety of children while commuting. Japanese children often walk to schools in groups. Witnesses said that as the attack unfolded, the bus driver shouted at the attacker, and as he was running away he cut his own neck, collapsing in a pool of blood as police seized him. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he was outraged by the attack. “Many small children were victimized, and I feel strong resentment,” Abe said as he was hosting President Donald Trump on a four-day state visit, which ended Tuesday. “I will take all possible measures to protect the safety of children.” Although Japan has one of the lowest crime rates in the world, it has had a series of high-profile killings, including in 2016 when a former employee at a home for the disabled allegedly killed 19 people and injured more than 20 others. Also in 2016, a man stabbed four people at a library in northeastern Japan, allegedly for mishandling his questions. No one was killed. In 2008, seven people were killed by a man who slammed a truck into a crowd of people in central Tokyo’s Akihabara electronics district and then stabbed passersby.

"138"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-iraqi-court-sentences-two-more-french-members-of-the-islamic-state/"|"Qassim Abdul-Zahra"|"An Iraqi court on Tuesday sentenced two high-profile French members of the Islamic State group to death, including one who featured in a propaganda video praising the 2015 Paris attacks, bringing the total number of French former jihadis condemned to death this week to six. France said it would do all it can to spare the group from execution in Iraq. Although it has made no effort to bring back the captured fighters, France is outspoken against the death penalty globally. The sentencings in Iraq come amid controversy about the legal treatment of thousands of foreign fighters who had joined IS at the height of its power in Syria and Iraq when the militant group declared its self-styled caliphate. Human rights groups are concerned they are being rushed through Iraqi counterterrorism courts in trials that raise questions over whether justice is being done. Convictions are often based on confessions that defendants and rights groups say are extracted by intimidation, torture and abuse and without due process. Although European IS members have been sentenced to death, none has actually been executed in Iraq. The men sentenced to death Tuesday were identified as Karam Salam Mohammed El-Harchaoui and Brahim Ali Mansour Nejara. They are among a group of 12 French citizens who were detained by the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces in neighbouring Syria and handed over to Iraq in January. The Kurdish-led group spearheaded the fight against IS in Syria and has handed over to Iraq hundreds of suspected IS members in recent months. Nejara, 32, helped run one of the networks that sent Europeans to join the Islamic State group and appeared in a video a week after the November 2015 attacks in Paris. The video was titled “Paris has collapsed” and shows a fictitious destruction of the Eiffel Tower, according to Jean-Charles Brisard of the Center of the Analysis of Terrorism. Nejara is originally from a suburb of the French city of Lyon called Meyzieu, long known to be a training ground for jihadis, even before the appearance of the Islamic State group. He is believed to have encouraged one of his brothers back home to carry out an attack in France, possibly on the stadium there. Two brothers were arrested in France. The video, in which he appeared armed and in military uniform praising the Paris attacks, was played in court Tuesday. The attacks killed 130 people and wounded more than 400. Nejara, speaking before the judge, said that he was forced to make the video because the group was looking for someone who speaks French. He said he was threatened with prison when he requested to appear masked in the video, before they agreed to his request. The other militant, El-Harchaoui, 33, lived in Belgium before he left for Syria in 2014. He was wounded in one of the battles he fought for IS in Syria. His second wife told The Associated Press he joined IS in Syria in 2014, was sent to Iraq to fight, escaped and travelled back to Syria’s Shaddadeh, then to Raqqa where he was wounded in an air strike in 2016. He was jailed for fleeing, then released. The two then met and married in October 2015, after which he was arrested again. “I know he will not have a fair trial,” Samira told the AP in an interview in March at camp Roj in northern Syria, where thousands of foreign women and children are languishing. El-Harchaoui showed off his wound to the court on Tuesday, pulling off the top of his yellow prison uniform to reveal a hole in his right shoulder where he was wounded from a shell that hit a nearby house. Three other French IS fighters had already been sentenced to death on Sunday, and a fourth on Monday. Those convicted can appeal their sentences within a month. Nabil Boudi, lawyer for Leonardo Lopez, who was sentenced to death earlier this week, told France Info radio that lawyers for the French citizens were waiting for the end of all the trials before appealing. Human rights groups have criticized Iraq’s handling of IS trials, accusing authorities of relying on circumstantial evidence and often extracting confessions under torture. Judge Abdul Sattar Bayraqdar, a judicial spokesman, said Iraq is prosecuting these militants on behalf of all the countries of the world. “By punishing these criminals, we are saving the world from their evils,” he told AP. The former IS members all said they regretted what they’d done. However, they all referred to IS by the Arabic name of “Tanzeem,” or organization, rather than Daesh, even when the judge did. The Arabic acronym for the group is deemed offensive by IS and its supporters. France’s foreign minister said earlier Tuesday that his government is working to spare the group of condemned Frenchmen from execution after Iraq sentenced them to death. Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian also reiterated France’s position but said the IS militants should be tried where they committed their crimes. “We are multiplying efforts to avoid the death penalty for these … French people,” he said on France-Inter radio. He didn’t elaborate, but said he spoke to Iraq’s president about the case. Boudi, the lawyer, accused France of engaging in “doublespeak.” He said France knew full well the moment the French citizens were transferred to Iraq that they were going to be sentenced to death. He said the investigation lasted three months and was a judicial fiasco. “The idea of a fair trial is a farce, a huge joke.” "|"Iraqi court sentences two more French members of the Islamic State group to death"|"2019-05-28T08:49:25-0400"|"Iraq,ISIS,French ISIS members,Islamic State,news,world,Syria,syria,iraq,france,death,group,video,paris,week",

WHO emergencies chief Dr. Michael Ryan told reporters in Geneva that disease surveillance has improved even as the number of attacks against health workers rose threefold over the last five months. Five health workers have died since the outbreak began in August. “We’ve also managed to improve surveillance performance in terms of the proportion of cases coming off contact lists,” he said. Disease transmission has “decreased significantly” over the last couple of weeks in the epicentres of Butembo and Katwa though challenges remain there, he added. Doctors Without Borders, which pulled out of Ebola treatment centres in Butembo and Katwa earlier this year because of the violence, said contact tracing is still too low. “As few as 32 per cent of the new confirmed cases were linked back to known contacts,” the group said in a statement. “This means that the listing of contacts and surveillance are not effective. Contact tracing is essential to control the evolution of the outbreak.” More than 1,200 people have now died in the second-deadliest Ebola outbreak in history. Virus containment efforts are particularly challenging because the highly volatile security situation makes it too dangerous for surveillance teams to access some areas. The real number of Ebola cases is “likely to be even higher” because of the difficulties in tracing cases, Doctors Without Borders said. The disease is spread mainly through contact with the bodily fluids of Ebola patients and victims. In an effort to contain the virus, health workers monitor those who are known to have come into contact with an Ebola patient for a period of 21 days. If new cases haven’t previously been identified as possible contacts by outbreak responders that suggests authorities have little idea where the virus is spreading. The violence also has kept workers from being able to vaccinate people in some communities.

"140"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-serbia-puts-security-forces-on-alert-after-kosovo-police-operation-in/"|"Dusan Stojanovic"|"Serbia put its troops on full alert Tuesday after heavily armed Kosovo police entered Serb-dominated northern Kosovo, firing tear gas and arresting about two dozen people in what they called an anti-organized crime operation. It was the latest flare-up in long-simmering tensions between Serbia and its former province, which declared independence from Belgrade in 2008 after a bloody 1998-99 war that ended only with NATO intervention. Serbs make up 90 per cent of the population in northern Kosovo and they want to remain part of Serbia, not an independent Kosovo. Action by Kosovo special police there is rare and always triggers Serb anger. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said Kosovo police arrested 23 people, including Serbs, Bosnians and a Russian, after “bursting” into several northern villages and the town of Mitrovica with armoured vehicles. Vucic said he had seen video of the police firing “live ammunition” over the heads of unarmed Serbs, and said the operation was designed to intimidate minority Serbs in Kosovo, whose population is mostly ethnic Albanians. Vucic said he has ordered soldiers near the border to be on “combat alert” to protect Serbs if tensions escalate. “Serbia will try to preserve peace and stability, but will be fully ready to protect our people at the shortest notice,” Vucic told parliament. He later said that the Kosovo policemen withdrew from northern Kosovo. But in a sign of lingering tensions, Serb troops and armoured vehicles were seen leaving their barracks in central Serbia and headed toward the Kosovo border. An air force MiG-29 fighter jet made a low pass near the border with Kosovo, according to the state Tanjug news agency. Any Serbian armed incursion into Kosovo would mean a direct clash with NATO-led peacekeepers there. Lately, Serbia has been making frequent military threats against Kosovo as its political and military alliance with Russia grows stronger despite a proclaimed European Union membership goal. Kosovo police said five police officers and six civilians were injured during an operation against organized crime and corruption, and 19 police officers and a number of other people were arrested. The UN mission in Kosovo said those detained included two of its staff, one of them Russian. It said both employees were hospitalized for injuries, and it called for all parties to help restore calm and security. Later, the mission said the Russian citizen was released and Tanjug reported he was taken to a Serb hospital in northern Mitrovica with injuries to the head and face. Russia called Kosovo’s actions a “provocation” and demanded the immediate release of the Russian UN employee. Kosovo President Hashim Thaci said earlier that the Russian “was camouflaged under a diplomatic veil to hamper the police operation.” Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj urged the ethnic Serb minority to remain calm and support the police. “Those involved in illegal activities will go behind bars,” he wrote on his Facebook page, insisting that the police operation was not targeting people from specific ethnicities. Kosovo’s foreign minister said his country’s authorities are set to carry out more police actions like Tuesday’s operation that sent tensions with Serbia soaring. “I believe it’s not the last operation in Kosovo. … Maybe today, maybe tomorrow or in next days. We are fighting organized crime,” said the minister, Behgjet Pacolli. The spokesman for the NATO peacekeeping mission, Col. Vincenzo Grasso, said the force is monitoring the situation and co-ordinating with authorities. “Because of the political sensitivity of the moment, Commander KFOR invites all the parties to deal with the disputes peacefully and responsibly, without any use of force or violence. People should stay calm, they have nothing to fear,” the mission said in a statement. Serbia and allies Russia and China do not recognize Kosovo’s 2008 declaration of independence, while the U.S. and more than 100 other countries do. The lingering dispute has stalled both countries’ efforts to become EU members. The two sides had been taking part in an EU-facilitated dialogue, but Serbia walked away in November after Kosovo slapped a 100 per cent tax on Bosnian and Serbian imports, saying it will be lifted only when the two countries recognize Kosovo’s sovereignty.

"141"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-eu-leaders-fire-starting-gun-for-top-jobs-race-3/"|"Lorne Cook Mike Corder"|"France and Germany appeared on a collision course Tuesday over who should hold one of the European Union’s most coveted jobs, after weekend elections across the 28-nation bloc redrew Europe’s political map. At an EU summit in Brussels, French President Emmanuel Macron virtually ruled out the prospect of German politician Manfred Weber replacing Jean-Claude Juncker as the new president of the bloc’s executive arm, the European Commission. Juncker’s term at the commission, which proposes EU laws and makes sure they’re enforced, is due to end on Oct. 31 and leaders from across the continent are gathering in Brussels to debate who should succeed him. Macron told reporters that his preferred choice for the post would be someone who has “experience either in their country or in Europe that allows them to have credibility and savoir faire.” That appeared to be a swipe at Weber, who has never served in government or a major institution like the commission. Weber, 46, has led the conservative European People’s Party group – the biggest group in the EU assembly – since 2014. Macron said Denmark’s Margrethe Vestager, who is the commissioner responsible for competition matters, would be a suitable replacement as would Michel Barnier, the Frenchman who has led the EU’s Brexit negotiations with the EU. Getting Barnier to head the commission would mark a fillip for Macron following the strong showing of the French far-right in Sunday’s elections. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose ruling coalition suffered losses at the polls, notably to the Greens, continues to back Weber. “I as a member of the EPP family will of course work to support Manfred Weber,” she said. Both the EPP and centre-left Socialists got battered in Sunday’s elections as voters concerned about climate change, migration or security turned instead to the Greens, the pro-business ALDE group – of which Macron’s party will now be a member – or far-right parties. As a result, it’s unclear what workable majority will emerge in the European Parliament when lawmakers gather in July, especially as leaders and party groups jockey for position. Leaders hailed the election turnout at its highest for 20 years, and promised a new and more dynamic Europe with climate change, job creation, social welfare and an improved migration policy at its heart. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez threw his political weight behind the Socialists’ candidate Frans Timmermans, who is a former Dutch foreign minister and currently Juncker’s right hand man at the commission. “We will support Frans,” Sanchez said. “He has the experience not only at the national level but also at the European level to lead the commission.” EU leaders are also expected to discuss other top jobs in the bloc during their dinner later, including who will replace Donald Tusk as European Council President. Tusk, who chairs the meetings of EU leaders, is also due to stand down from his job at the end of October. EU leaders are also expected to discuss who will replace Federica Mogherini as the bloc’s next high representative – essentially the foreign minister – and who will succeed Mario Draghi as the next head of the European Central Bank. The leaders want to move quickly. They hope to be able to name candidates to the top posts at their next summit on June 20-21. “We want to find a solution as quickly as possible, because the European Parliament will meet at the beginning of July and it would of course be desirable if there were already a proposal at that point,” Merkel said earlier in Berlin. Early signs indicate that the process will take some time, and that a power struggle between the EU Council, which represents national governments, and the parliament is imminent. No clear candidate for Juncker’s post emerged from a meeting Tuesday morning among party group leaders at the parliament, whose members must endorse the new commission president. Instead, they insisted only that the person be chosen from among the candidates put forward by the parliamentary blocs. This puts them at odds with Macron, who is insisting that EU leaders should decide on who will head the commission. Favourites for the top jobs are likely to be traded off to maximize influence over the world’s biggest trading bloc. Nationality and gender are certain to influence the final choice.

The strike comes as talks between protesters and the military council, which took over the country after al-Bashir’s ouster, remain deadlocked. The two sides are split over the makeup and leadership of a sovereign council that would run the country during a three-year transition period. The talks stalled despite apparent progress in negotiations earlier this month over an interim Cabinet and a legislative body for the transitional period. The protesters demand “limited military representation” on the sovereign council but the ruling generals refuse to relinquish power. After the military ousted al-Bashir, who ruled for 30 years, army generals took over but the protesters remained in the streets, mainly in a sit-in outside the military’s headquarters in Khartoum, the country’s capital, demanding the military hand over power. The protesters are represented by the Forces for Declaration of Freedom and Change, an alliance of opposition groups and activists. The leading opposition Umma Party on Tuesday, however, criticized some groups within the alliance for “erroneous and hasty actions,” such as the call for the strike. The party didn’t name any specific groups. Umma said Sunday it opposes the “preparations and timing” of the two-day strike. Party chief Sadek al-Mahdi led the country’s last democratically elected government, which Omar al-Bashir, an autocrat supported by the military, ousted with Islamist support in 1989. Umma is a member of the FDFC. Wajdi Saleh, a negotiator for the protesters, said they decided to hold the strike after negotiations with the military were suspended. The protesters earlier threatened a civil disobedience campaign if the generals fail to comply with their demands. “They’ve refused all our proposals,” Saleh told a press conference late on Monday in Khartoum. “If we don’t achieve our goals, we will use the civil weapon through a comprehensive strike and open civil disobedience.” The Sudanese Professionals’ Association, which has spearheaded the protests since late last year, urged people to show up at work on Tuesday and Wednesday but abstain from any activity. People were seen standing outside their work places in Khartoum on Tuesday morning. Outside the Byblos Bank headquarters, a group of employees chanted: “Freedom, peace, justice and a civilian led-authority is the choice of the people.” They held up placards, reading “I’m a bank employee, on strike.” Al-Jayli Nour, an employee, said the protesters are clear they want a civilian-led authority. “This revolution wasn’t started in order for the country to be ruled by the military,” he said. Electric plant workers joined the strike, as did health workers and employees in Sudan’s central bank. A tour of the city’s streets revealed that many shops and restaurants joined the strike and transportation, including railways, had come to a halt. By Tuesday afternoon, thousands of protesters marched to the sit-in outside the military complex in Khartoum The deputy head of the military council, Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, better known as Hemedti, criticized the strike. “Is it justified to cut off water and electricity? We are part of the revolution, and without the armed forces and without the security apparatus, Omar al-Bashir would stay in power until now,” he said. “This situation doesn’t lead the country forward,” he added. He said the military was ready for an immediate transfer of power to civilians, and he called for all Sudanese to take part in the transition. The military council said in April that al-Bashir’s National Congress party would not join the transitional government. “If we find a trusted person, tonight and before tomorrow we will hand over power to him,” Dagalo said. His comments came at a ceremony hosted by a tribal leader in Khartoum’s twin city of Omdurman. On Monday, Dagalo accused the protest forces of not being serious about sharing power during the transition. Meanwhile in Cairo, EgyptAir said Tuesday it cancelled two flights to Khartoum due to events in Sudan. The airline said it would resume the flights later Tuesday. Workers at the Khartoum International Airport had announced they would join the strike. Footage and photos circulated online showed images of empty airport halls as well as flight attendants holding prostrike posters outside the facility. “They didn’t allow any plane to arrive in Sudan. Why are they making this strike? From tomorrow any plane wants to arrive in Sudan, it will be welcomed,” Dagalo said.

President Alexander Van der Bellen’s move followed more than a week of turmoil that began with the publication of a video showing a coalition figure, the leader of Austria’s far-right Freedom Party, appearing to offer lucrative government contracts to a purported Russian investor. That prompted Mr. Kurz to pull the plug on the governing coalition between his right-wing People’s Party and the Freedom Party and call for a new national election. During an acrimonious session Monday in Parliament, the Freedom Party and the opposition Social Democrats accused Mr. Kurz of seeking to consolidate power while he and his People’s Party are riding high in the polls. Both parties then voted in favour of a no-confidence motion against Mr. Kurz’s government. Buoyed by a strong first-place showing in the European election on Sunday,Mr. Kurz vowed not to be gone for long, suggesting that his party would emerge even stronger in Austria’s national election in September. “In the end, the people will decide in September, and I’m happy about that,” he told a cheering crowd in Vienna. Mr. Van der Bellen needs to appoint a caretaker government to run the country until the national election, and has said he expects to do that in the next week. He plans to hold talks with all parties to find suitable candidates. Until that government is in place, Mr. Van der Bellen temporarily kept the same Cabinet ministers in place. Mr. Kurz’s deputy chancellor, Finance Minister Hartwig Loeger, is taking over the duties of chancellor until the interim government is appointed. Mr. Van der Bellen took the occasion to admonish all parties to tone down their rhetoric and engage in constructive dialogue. “I think that the current situation shows how important conversations are,” he said.

"144"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-britains-jeremy-hunt-says-pursuing-a-no-deal-brexit-would-be/"|"Alistair Smout Gabriela Baczynska"|"The European Union will not renegotiate the Brexit deal that Prime Minister Theresa May agreed, Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said on Tuesday, as concerns grew that a successor to Ms. May could trigger a confrontation with the bloc. Brexit is up in the air after Ms. May announced plans to step down, triggering a leadership contest in the ruling Conservative Party that could bring a new prime minister to power who wants a much more decisive break with the EU. One of the candidates, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, said it would be “political suicide” to pursue a no-deal Brexit, a reprimand to front-runner Boris Johnson who said last week that Britain should leave with or without a deal by the end of October. Mr. Hunt, who voted to stay in the EU in the 2016 referendum but now accepts Brexit, said he would try for a new agreement that would take Britain out of the EU customs union while “respecting legitimate concerns” around the Irish border. The EU, though, said there would be no renegotiation. “I will have a short meeting with Theresa May, but I was crystal clear: There will be no renegotiation,” Mr. Juncker said before a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said he believed the risk of Britain crashing out of the bloc without any divorce agreement was increasing. “Well I think there is a growing risk of a no-deal. There’s a possibility that the new British prime minister may try to repudiate the withdrawal agreement,” he told reporters. Any successor to Ms. May will have to accept that the Brexit divorce deal she agreed will not be ratified by the current British Parliament, so they will have to find a solution to the Irish border issue that upset many lawmakers. Many Brexit supporters opposed her deal because of a “backstop” that requires Britain to adopt some EU rules indefinitely unless a future arrangement is found to keep open the land border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. Under laws now in effect, Britain will automatically leave the EU on Oct. 31 without an agreement unless Parliament approves one first, the EU grants an extension, or the government revokes its decision to leave. Pitching himself in contrast to Mr. Johnson and others who insist leaving the EU without a deal must remain on the table, Mr. Hunt said any such move would be blocked by lawmakers and trigger a national election. “Trying to deliver no deal through a general election is not a solution; it is political suicide,” Mr. Hunt wrote in Tuesday’s Daily Telegraph. “A different deal is, therefore, the only solution – and what I will pursue if I am leader.” Trade Secretary Liam Fox, who is not running for the premiership, said while leaving with a deal was preferable, the leadership candidates were agreed that leaving the EU without a deal was better than not leaving. “If the EU doesn’t want to negotiate any changes – which I think would be unfortunate and I think would be quite surprising – then I think that of course does increase the chance of a no-deal exit,” Mr. Fox said during a trade visit to Egypt. Rivals for the top job were quick to reject Mr. Hunt’s views. “Political suicide actually lies in not having a clean break from the EU and not leaving on the 31st October,” Esther McVey, a Brexit hardliner and former minister who is standing for the leadership, said in a tweet. Under the party’s rules for picking a new leader, Conservative lawmakers will select a shortlist of candidates and put them to the party’s members for a vote. So far, 10 candidates have said they are running. The Conservative Party had a disastrous showing in European elections at the weekend, losing most of its support to a new Brexit Party, which topped the poll while calling for a swift no-deal exit from the EU. Other parties that want to halt Brexit altogether also surged in the vote, leaving little space in the middle for Britain’s two main traditional parties, the Conservatives and Labour, both of which had campaigned in favour of a compromise. Labour has since edged closer to a position that could make it possible to call off Brexit, saying a public vote – either a new national election or second referendum – is the way to reunite the country. Several of Labour’s senior figures have called on its leadership to go further and openly call for a new referendum in which the party would campaign to stay in the EU.

"145"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-string-of-apparent-tornadoes-leave-trail-of-destruction-across-ohio/"|"Angie Wang John Minchillo"|"A swarm of tornadoes so tightly packed that one may have crossed the path carved by another tore across Indiana and Ohio overnight, smashing homes, blowing out windows and ending the school year early for some students because of damage to buildings. One person was killed and at least 130 were injured. The storms were among 55 twisters that forecasters said may have touched down Monday across eight states stretching eastward from Idaho and Colorado. The past couple of weeks have seen unusually high tornado activity in the U.S., with no immediate end to the pattern in sight. The winds peeled away roofs — leaving homes looking like giant dollhouses — knocked houses off their foundations, toppled trees, brought down power lines and churned up so much debris that it was visible on radar. Highway crews had to use snowplows to clear an Ohio interstate. Some of the heaviest damage was reported just outside Dayton, Ohio. “I just got down on all fours and covered my head with my hands,” said Francis Dutmers, who with his wife headed for the basement of their home in Vandalia, about 10 miles (16 kilometres) outside Dayton, when the storm hit with a “very loud roar” Monday night. The winds blew out windows around his house, filled rooms with debris and took down most of his trees. In Celina, Ohio, 82-year-old Melvin Dale Hanna was killed when a parked car was blown into his house, Mayor Jeffrey Hazel said Tuesday. “There’s areas that truly look like a war zone,” he said. Of the injured, more than two dozen were admitted to hospitals. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine declared a state of emergency in three hard-hit counties, allowing the state to suspend normal purchasing procedures and quickly provide supplies like water and generators. Reports posted online by the National Weather Service’s Storm Prediction Center showed that 14 suspected tornadoes touched down in Indiana, 12 in Colorado and nine in Ohio. Seven were reported in Iowa, five in Nebraska, four in Illinois and three in Minnesota, with one in Idaho. Monday marked the record-tying 11th straight day with at least eight tornadoes in the U.S., said Patrick Marsh, a Storm Prediction Center meteorologist. The last such stretch was in 1980. “We’re getting big counts on a lot of these days, and that is certainly unusual,” Marsh said. To the west, thunderstorms dropped hail as large as tennis balls in Colorado, and dozens of drivers in Nebraska pulled off Interstate 80 with broken windshields. Forecasters warned of the possibility of powerful thunderstorms during the Tuesday afternoon rush hour in the Kansas City area, as well as more bad weather in Ohio. The National Weather Service in Kansas City issued a tornado emergency for Kansas City, Kansas; Shawnee and Bonner Springs, Kansas until 7:15 p.m. Officials reported a tornado touching down outside near Kansas City on a path toward the city of Lawrence, Kansas on Tuesday evening. Assistant Director Jillian Roderigue said Douglas County Emergency Management received a report of a tornado about 6:10 p.m. near the small community of Lone Star, southwest of Lawrence. She said there no immediate reports of injuries. But local television stations were showing damage on the south side of Lawrence. The city of about 100,000 residents is home to the University of Kansas. It is about 50 miles (80 kilometres) southwest of the Kansas City International Airport. A tornado with winds up to 140 mph (225 kph) struck late Monday near Trotwood, Ohio, a community of about 24,500 people 8 miles (12 kilometres) outside Dayton. Several apartment buildings were damaged or destroyed, including one complex where the entire roof was torn away, and at least three dozen people were treated for cuts, bumps and bruises. “If I didn’t move quick enough, what could have happened?” said Erica Bohannon of Trotwood, who hid in a closet with her son and their dog. She emerged to find herself looking at the sky. The roof was gone. Just before midnight, about 40 minutes after that tornado cut through, the National Weather Service tweeted that another one was crossing its path. Only a few minor injuries were reported in Dayton. Fire Chief Jeffrey Payne called that “pretty miraculous,” attributing it to people heeding early warnings. Sirens went off ahead of the storm. Some of the people treated at the area’s Kettering Health Network hospitals were hurt during storm clean-up itself, while others may have waited before seeking treatment from storm injuries, said spokeswoman Elizabeth Long. A boil-water advisory was issued after the city’s pumping stations lost power. Dayton Power & Light said more than 50,000 customers remained without electricity and restoration efforts could take days. A high school gym in Dayton was designated an emergency shelter until authorities realized it was unusable. Vandalia’s school system tweeted that it is ending the year two days early because of building damage. In nearby hard-hit Brookville, where the storm tore off the school’s roof, classes were cancelled. In Indiana, a twister touched down Monday evening in Pendleton, about 35 miles (56 kilometres) from Indianapolis. At least 75 homes were damaged there and in nearby Huntsville, said Madison County Emergency Management spokesman Todd Harmeson. No serious injuries were reported. Pendleton residents were urged to stay in their homes Tuesday morning because of downed power lines and other dangers. “People are getting antsy. I know they want to get outdoors, and I know they want to see what’s going on in the neighbourhood,” Harmeson said. But he added: “We still have hazards out there.” Outbreaks of 50 or more tornadoes are not uncommon, having happened 63 times in U.S. history, with three instances of more than 100 twisters, Marsh said. But Monday’s swarm was unusual because it happened over a particularly wide geographic area and came amid an especially active stretch, he said. As for why it’s happening, Marsh said high pressure over the Southeast and an unusually cold trough over the Rockies are forcing warm, moist air into the central U.S., triggering repeated severe thunderstorms and tornadoes. And neither system is showing signs of moving, he said.

"146"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-europes-greens-emerge-as-a-force-as-young-voters-shun-the-traditional/"|"Eric Reguly"|"The European Union elections propelled the Green parties from the political fringe to the political core, making them in effect the new left and a formidable power in the EU Parliament. The Greens were big winners in Sunday’s election, especially among young voters. They placed second in Germany, Ireland and Finland and third in France and Luxembourg. In Britain, they placed a respectable fourth, just behind the Labour Party, pushing the ruling Conservatives into the humiliating fifth position. A Green candidate placed first in Dublin. The green wave will give the parties an estimated 69 seats in the 751-member European Parliament, up from 52 (some poll counts were still under way on Tuesday). Their electoral success came largely at the expense of the mainstream centre-left parties, which, together with the traditional centre-right parties, lost their combined majority in Parliament for the first time since 1979, when EU elections began. Crucially, the Green bloc will be just a few seats short of the estimated 71 held by the far-right, nationalist bloc known as the European Alliance of People and Nations and led by Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, whose anti-migrant League party placed first in Italy. The Green bloc’s newfound clout will make them coveted coalition partners – for a price: In exchange for their loyalty, they will demand respect for their agenda of social justice, civil liberties, pacifism and, above all, action on climate change. “In exchange for Green policy, we are ready to play a constructive role in the building of a majority [in Parliament],” said Sven Giegold, the lead candidate for Parliament’s Green alliance, in a statement after the election. “From now on, the other parties can no longer just talk climate protection, they must also act for climate protection. … The European Union must now become a climate and social union.” In perhaps the ultimate compliment, Alexander Gauland, co-leader of the far-right, ultranationalist Alternative for Germany party – the main opposition in the German parliament, whose success in the 2017 election embarrassed Chancellor Angela Merkel – declared the Greens “our main enemy.” Other European politicians said the Green parties’ rise will change the debate in Parliament. “It’s a clear message from the public that they want us to do more on climate action – and we’ve got the message,” Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar tweeted. The Greens’ strong showing in the election – especially in Germany, where they doubled their share of the vote to almost 21 per cent – did not come as a shock. The centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), the junior partner in Ms. Merkel’s ruling coalition, has been in freefall in recent years. Millions of voters who are giving up on the SPD appear to be gravitating to the Greens. “The Greens in Germany are an established party of the centre-left and they have benefited from the weakness in the Social Democrats,” Christian Odendahl, chief economist for Berlin’s Centre for European Reform, said in an interview. “The environmental issues came out on top in the election. Climate change is a very visible issue in Germany, and the Social Democrats had trouble positioning themselves on the climate debate.” Germany’s Greens, and for that matter Europe’s Greens, did not come out of nowhere. Unlike North America’s tiny Green political movement (Canada’s Parliament has just two Green MPs), European Greens have a fairly long political history and, in some countries, notably Germany, have developed sophisticated electioneering machines. In Germany, they began as an environmental and peace activist party in the early 1980s, built themselves into a small political force and entered parliament for the first time in 1983. From 1998 to 2005, they were the junior coalition partner in the SPD government of chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. In addition to national representation, they have seats or are part of ruling coalitions in most of the country’s 16 state legislatures. Their appeal broadened as they shed their status as a mere radical protest party, moving closer to the centre-left. In recent years, they have exploited the rising fear about the potentially catastrophic effects of climate change. Their cause has been helped by climate activists such as Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager who has inspired hundreds of thousands of young people around the world to skip school or march in protest of government inaction on climate policy. The Greens, however, did not make breakthroughs in much of the EU. In Eastern and Southern Europe, the parties went pretty much nowhere. In Italy, they won only about 2 per cent of the vote, meaning the Italian Greens will send no members to the European Parliament. Francesco Galietti, chief executive of Policy Sonar, a political consultancy in Rome, said the Greens never gained political traction in Italy in good part because of a lack of discipline and organization. “Historically, the Greens in Italy were always specialized branches of the left, with frequent frictions and conflict,” he said. “So there has never been such a thing as a consistent Green party with an identity of its own.” Still, the future looks bright for Europe’s Green parties. Exit polls in Germany and a few other countries showed that young and first-time voters made the Greens their top choice. Their popularity takes blows now and again – in Germany in late 2018, they were polling as high as 24 per cent – but their European election results are their best showing yet.

"147"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-deaths-rise-as-nepal-issues-more-permits-for-mount-everest-2/"|"Upendra Man Singh Binaj Gurubacharya Emily Schmall"|"Scaling Mount Everest was a dream few realized before Nepal opened its side of the mountain to commercial climbing a half-century ago. This year the government issued a record number of permits, leading to traffic jams on the world’s highest peak that likely contributed to the greatest death toll in four years. As the allure of Everest grows, so have the crowds, with inexperienced climbers faltering on the narrow passageway to the peak and causing deadly delays, veteran climbers said. After 11 people died this year, Nepal tourism officials have no intention of restricting the number of permits issued, instead encouraging even more tourists and climbers to come “for both pleasure and fame,” said Mohan Krishna Sapkota, secretary at the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation. Nepal, one of the world’s poorest countries, relies on the climbing industry to bring in $300 million each year. It doesn’t cap the number of permits it issues or control the pace or timing of the expeditions, leaving that to tour operators and guides who take advantage of brief clear weather conditions whenever they come, leading to pileups near the peak. On May 22, a climber snapped a photo from a line with dozens of hikers in colorful winter gear that snaked into the sky. Climbers were crammed crampon-to-crampon along a sharp-edged ridge above South Col, with a 7,000-foot (2,000-meter) drop on either side, all clipped onto a single line of rope, trudging toward the top of the world and risking death as each minute ticked by. “There were more people on Everest than there should be,” said Kul Bahadur Gurung, general secretary of the Nepal Mountaineering Association, an umbrella group of all expedition operators in Nepal. “We lack the rules and regulations that say how many people can actually go up and when.” The death toll this season is the highest since 2015. Most of those who died are believed to have suffered from altitude sickness, which is caused by low amounts of oxygen at high elevation and can cause headaches, vomiting, shortness of breath and mental confusion. Once only accessible to well-heeled elite mountaineers, Nepal’s booming climbing market has driven down the cost of an expedition, opening Everest up to hobbyists and adventure-seekers. Nepal requires climbers to have a doctors’ note deeming them physically fit, but not to prove their stamina at such extreme heights. Because of the altitude, climbers have just hours to reach the top before they are at risk of a pulmonary edema, when the lungs fill with liquid. From Camp Four at 8,000 metres (26,240 feet) to the 8,850-meter (29,035-foot) peak, the final push on Everest is known as the “death zone.” The conditions are so intense at such times that when a person dies, no one can afford to expend energy on carrying the body down from the mountain. “Every minute counts there,” said Eric Murphy, a mountain guide from Bellingham, Washington, who climbed Everest for a third time on May 23. He said what should have taken 12 hours took 17 hours because of struggling climbers who were clearly exhausted but had no one to guide or help them. Just a handful of inexperienced climbers, he said, is “enough to have a profound effect.” The deaths this year on Nepal’s side of the mountain included Don Cash, a sales executive from Utah, and Christopher Kulish, an attorney from Colorado, who both died on their way down from the peak. Kulish, 62, had just reached the top with a small group after crowds of climbers congested the peak last week, according to his brother, Mark Kulish. He described his brother as an attorney who was an “inveterate climber of peaks in Colorado, the West and the world over.” Just before he died, Kulish made it into the so-called “Seven Summit Club” of mountaineers who have reached the highest peaks on every continent, his brother said. Cash, 55, collapsed at the summit and was given CPR and massages by his two Sherpa guides. He got up only to fall again in the same way at Hillary Step, the first cliff face down from the summit. His body was left near there. Cash had said on his LinkedIn page that he left his job as a sales executive to try to join the seven summits club. Nepal doesn’t have any regulations to determine how many permits should be issued, so anyone with a doctor’s note can obtain one for an $11,000 fee, Sapkota said. This year, permits were issued to 381 people in 44 teams, the highest number ever, according to the government. They were accompanied by an equal number of guides from Nepal’s ethnic Sherpa community. Some climbers were originally issued permits in 2014 that were revoked mid-season when 16 Sherpa guides died in an avalanche and other Sherpas, whose support as guides and porters is essential, effectively went on strike. Another factor was China’s limit on the number of permits it issued this year for routes in its territory on the north side of Everest for a clean-up. Both the north and south sides of the mountain are littered with empty oxygen canisters, food packaging and other debris. Instead of the overcrowding, Sapkota blamed the weather, equipment and inadequate supplemental oxygen for this year’s deaths. “There has been concern about the number of climbers on Mount Everest but it is not because of the traffic jam that there were casualties,” Sapkota said in Namche, the town that serves as the staging area for Everest trips. Still, he said, “In the next season we will work to have double rope in the area below the summit so there is better management of the flow of climbers.” Mirza Ali, a Pakistani mountaineer and tour company owner who reached Everest’s peak for the first time this month, on his fourth attempt, said such an approach was flawed. “Everybody wants to stand on top of the world,” but tourists unprepared for the extremes of Everest endanger the entire industry, he said. “There is not a sufficient check on issuing the permits,” Ali said. “The more people come, the more permits, more business. But on the other side it is a lot of risk because it is costing lives.” Indian climber Ameesha Chauhan, soaking her frostbitten toes in medicine at a hospital in Kathmandu, described the agony of turning away from the peak when she realized her supplemental oxygen supply was low. Two of her team members died on the May 16 ascent. She returned and scaled the peak a week later. “If you look at it, the inexperienced climbers do not even know how to tie on the oxygen masks around their face,” she said. “Many climbers are too focused on reaching the summit.” "|"Deaths rise as Nepal issues more permits for Mount Everest"|"2019-05-28T06:51:47-0400"|"Nepal,Mount Everest,Everest deaths,mountaineering,adventure,adventure seekers,everest climber,nepal,peak,everest,number,people,side,climber,summit",

Ms. Yeo said Malaysia and many developing countries have become new targets after China banned the import of plastic waste last year. Last week, the Philippines said it would ship back dozens of containers of garbage that Philippine officials said were illegally shipped to the country from Canada in 2013 to 2014. Ms. Yeo said 60 containers stacked with contaminated waste were smuggled in en route to illegal processing facilities in Malaysia and will be sent back to their countries of origin. Opinion: Canada’s recycling system is trash – but it’s not too late to fix it Also: Reduce, reuse, recycle, rejected: Why Canada’s recycling industry is in crisis mode Ten of the containers are set to be shipped back within two weeks, she said, as she showed reporters contents of the waste at a port outside Kuala Lumpur. The displayed items included cables from Britain, contaminated milk cartons from Australia and compact discs from Bangladesh, as well as bales of electronic and household waste from the U.S., Canada, Japan, Saudi Arabia and China. Ms. Yeo said the waste from China appeared to be garbage from France and other countries that had been rerouted after a ban imposed by China. In one case alone, Ms. Yeo said a British recycling company exported more than 50,000 tonnes of plastic waste in about 1,000 containers to Malaysia over the past two years. “This is probably just the tip of the iceberg [due] to the banning of plastic waste by China,” Ms. Yeo told a news conference. “Malaysia will not be a dumping ground to the world … we will fight back. Even though we are a small country, we can’t be bullied by developed countries.” The government has clamped down on dozens of illegal plastic recycling facilities that had mushroomed across the country, shuttering more than 150 plants since last July. Earlier this month, the government also sent back five containers of waste to Spain. Ms. Yeo said China’s plastic waste ban had “opened up the eyes of the world to see that we have a huge garbage and recycling problem.” Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has threatened to forcibly ship back dozens of containers of garbage to Canada and his government recalled its ambassador and consuls in Canada over Ottawa’s failure to comply with a May 15 deadline to take back the garbage. Canadian Environment Minister Catherine McKenna said the Canadian government had awarded a contract to French shipping giant Bollore Logistics Canada that calls for the return of 69 containers filled with household waste and electronic garbage to Canada by the end of June. The Philippines, however, rejected Canada’s plan. Presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo said the government will proceed with a plan to look for a private shipping company to rapidly transport the garbage to Canada. Philippine officials were assessing separate shipments from Hong Kong and Australia that environmental activists said allegedly contained garbage and should be sent back to their points of origin. In Port Klang, Ms. Yeo said citizens in rich countries diligently separate their waste for recycling, but the garbage ended up being dumped in developing countries where they are recycled illegally, causing environmental and health hazards, she said. “We urge the developed countries to review their management of plastic waste and stop shipping the garbage out to the developing countries,” she said, calling such practices “unfair and uncivilized.” Ms. Yeo vowed to take action against Malaysian companies illegally importing used plastic, calling them “traitors to the country’s sustainability.” "|"Malaysia to send plastic waste back to foreign countries including Canada"|"2019-05-28T07:13:12-0400"|"waste management,malaysia,waste containers,non-recyclable plastic waste,garbage disposal,Malaysia Environment Minister Yeo Bee Yin,the Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte,Kuala Lumpur,Canadian Environment Minister Catherine McKenna,Port Klang,canada,waste,china,garbage,country",

The company also could wipe the phones remotely if they were seized. Prosecutors said Ramos’ clients included the Sinaloa drug cartel of Mexico and a global drug-trafficking and illicit gambling organization run by former University of Southern California football player Owen Hanson. Hanson is serving a 21-year prison sentence. Other clients were Hells Angels in Australia who used them to co-ordinate several killings, authorities said. Ramos boasted about his wares after seeing a 2014 news report that said use of his encrypted devices by a suspect in one high-profile murder had hampered the investigation. At least 7,000 of the phones were sold. “The scope of this case is staggering,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Young said, calling Ramos’ clients “some of the most sophisticated criminals in the world using some of the most sophisticated technology in the world.” It was the first U.S. conviction involving someone who provided encryption technology to criminal organizations. Four of Ramos’ co-defendants remain at large. “I am sorry and accept responsibility for my actions that have led me here today,” Ramos told Judge William Hayes. He said he turned “a blind eye” to the use of his phones – which were marketed as a tool for business executives – for international drug sales. But prosecutors said Ramos set up his system intentionally to block interception of criminal communications by law enforcement. The anonymous clients used nicknames that included “leadslinger, The.cartel, The.killa, Elchapo66 and Knee—capper9,” the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. In a 2018 text message, Ramos urged an employee to get a brand new Range Rover “cuz I just closed a lot of business. This week man. Sinaloa cartel, that’s what’s up.” Ramos was arrested last year in Washington state and his secure communications network was dismantled. Some 250 law enforcement agents from the U.S, Canada and Australia reportedly were involved in the investigation.

Authorities say a man brandishing two knives slashed the girls and at least two parents as they gathered at a school bus stop in Kawasaki on Tuesday. An 11-year-old girl and a 39-year-old man were killed before the attacker fatally slashed himself in the neck. At least 17 people, mostly children attending Caritas elementary school, a Catholic private school, were injured. Many Japanese children walk to neighbourhood schools alone or in small groups, and some commute by themselves on trains or buses. Elderly people and volunteers often serve as crossing guards or safety monitors, with little other security. Mieko Miyata, the head of a non-profit research institute specializing in children’s safety, said many people in Japan are too complacent about safety because of the low crime rate. Safety officials often focus on responses to disasters rather than on crime prevention, she said. Children going to school are particularly vulnerable to attacks, she said, because they can be easily located at places such as school bus stops and often wear uniforms. “Teachers are not anti-crime professionals,” Miyata said. “In addition to neighbourhood monitoring and co-operation, there should be concrete anti-crime measures such as professional security guards in uniforms.” According to education ministry statistics from 2016, 66 per cent of schools had neighbourhood safety patrols staffed only by volunteers, and less than 10 per cent hired security guards at school. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told police and education officials on Wednesday to reinforce safety measures and patrols to protect schoolchildren across the country. He also asked for more neighbourhood watch groups by community volunteers, while urging schools and authorities to share information about suspicious people. “We must do whatever it takes to protect children’s safety,” Abe said. “I feel extreme regret about the extremely harrowing attack that affected many young children.” Japan’s government has previously published crime prevention manuals for commuting schoolchildren. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said officials are considering seeking out safe locations where children can gather before going to school in groups, either on foot or by bus. Some schools increased monitoring by teachers after the attack. In Saku City in central Japan, police instructed children to call out for help or use an anti-crime alarm if they see a suspicious person while commuting on a school bus. At Caritas school, children walk from a train station to a nearby bus stop to take a privately run bus to school, escorted by teachers. “The school was taking good care of our children for their safety, including the bus driver,” said a father of a student at the school who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity. “How on Earth can adults fully protect our children?” Police on Wednesday raided the home of the alleged attacker, 51-year-old Ryuichi Iwasaki, in Kawasaki. Police would not confirm details, but local media said investigators were searching for clues about the motive for the attack. City officials said Iwasaki lived with his elderly uncle and aunt and may have shunned other people. While shooting deaths are rare in Japan, the country has had a series of high-profile killings in recent years. In 2016, a former employee at a home for the disabled allegedly killed 19 people and injured more than 20. In 2001, a man forced his way into an elementary school in Osaka, stabbing eight children to death and injuring 15 other people, including teachers.

"151"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-russia-serbia-blame-pro-nato-and-western-influences-for-kosovo-police/"|"Dusan Stojanovic"|"Russia and its traditional ally Serbia on Wednesday blamed NATO and the European Union for the recent increase in tensions in Kosovo, where local police launched a raid in the Serb-dominated north of the country. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Tuesday’s incident, which saw heavily armed Kosovo police carry out what they said was an organized crime operation, was instigated by “those who want to create a buffer zone from Russia on the Balkans” and who “want to push everyone to NATO.” Speaking to reporters in Slovenia where he was on an official visit, Lavrov said the two bodies “hold sway” over the authorities in Kosovo. Tuesday’s raid saw Kosovo police arresting more than two dozen people including a Russian UN employee. Several people on both sides were injured in the clashes. The operation angered Serbia, which immediately put its army on full alert in response. Any Serbian armed incursion into Kosovo could lead to a standoff with NATO-led peacekeepers there. NATO troops have been present in Kosovo since 1999, when a bloody war between Serbia and its former province ended only after the western military alliance intervened. Serbia has in recent months made military threats against Kosovo as its political and military alliance with Moscow grows stronger despite a proclaimed ambition to join the EU. Serbia and Russia do not recognize Kosovo’s 2008 declaration of independence, while the U.S. and more than 100 other countries do. The lingering dispute has stalled both countries’ efforts to become EU members. For his part, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic accused NATO-led peacekeepers in Kosovo of “lying” when they said they had informed Belgrade in advance of the police action. He also criticized them for insisting that Tuesday’s raid in the north was a regular police operation. “NATO should do its job, and when they don’t do it, there are others who will,” Vucic warned. “They are not telling the truth. The situation for the Serb population in Kosovo is much worse than it was up until yesterday.” The KFOR peacekeeping mission spokesman, Col. Vincenzo Grasso, said he had been informed days before the raid. “That was not a surprise. Everybody was informed. That was on the news,” he said. The European Union’s top diplomat Federica Mogherini urged Kosovo and Serbia to return to the negotiating table and normalize relations amid tensions. She warned about “the risk of the dark forces of the past coming back, in terms of confrontation, even of conflict” if the two sides continue facing off. Thousands of people gathered Wednesday at a rally in the northern, Serb-dominated part of the divided city of Mitrovica to protest the arrests. The protesters waved Serbian flags and banners with the names of those who were detained. Politician Goran Rakic blamed the West for being behind Tuesday’s police move. “I implore you not to respond to their provocation cooked up in Western kitchens,” Rakic told the crowd. “They want us to negotiate with those who beat us. If they want to root out crime, they should start in their own yard.” "|"Russia, Serbia blame NATO and the EU for Kosovo tensions"|"2019-05-29T09:25:13-0400"|"Russia,Serbia,Kosovo,Kosovo police raid,NATO,Sergey Lavrov,Aleksadar Vucic,UN,news,world,kosovo,serbia,raid,nato,russia",

In a non-binding opinion to be published later Wednesday but seen by The Associated Press, the working group says that former Catalan regional vice-president, Oriol Junqueras, lawmaker Jordi Sanchez and activist Jordi Cuixart were arbitrarily detained and their rights violated. It also suggests that they should receive compensation for their time behind bars and that Spain should investigate their detentions. The three are among a dozen separatist leaders on trial at Spain’s Supreme Court on a number of charges, including rebellion, for their roles in disobeying a court ban and holding a prohibited independence referendum as well as making a subsequent independence declaration on Oct. 2017. State prosecutors on Wednesday said they are upholding their proposed sentence of 25 years for Junqueras, with smaller proposed sentences for the other defendants. Under Spanish law, suspects can be held in custody if they represent a flight risk, if the court believes they could commit possible further crimes, or if there is a risk they could destroy evidence. Other leaders of the secession bid, including former Catalan regional president Carles Puigdemont, fled the country and are fugitives from Spain, while the current Catalan chief, Quim Torra, has promised to continue to push for independence. The working group is made up of five independent, nonpaid experts appointed by the Human Rights Council. Though they are not UN staff, their opinions are meant to pressure governments but are often ignored. There was no immediate comment on the working group’s opinion from the Spanish government. The opinion’s release comes one day after the European Court of Human Rights rejected a suit brought by Catalan separatist lawmakers claiming that Spain’s top court violated their rights when it ruled to suspend a regional parliamentary session to declare independence two years ago. In that decision, the European court said that Spain’s constitutional Court’s decision had not violated their rights since its action was “aimed at protecting the constitutional order” and taken “in the interests of public safety (and) for the prevention of disorder.” Junqueras and Puigdemont were both recently elected to the European Parliament, although they face legal hurdles to actually take their seats.

They are ready. This is our assessment.” However, the expansion over the years of the 28-nation EU has complicated decision-making in the world’s biggest trade bloc, and it’s unclear whether member states will endorse the move. Upon taking up his post as commission president in 2014, Jean-Claude Juncker said no countries would join the EU during his term, which ends on Oct. 31. Mogherini said it’s not as if Albania and North Macedonia would join “the union tomorrow morning. It’s a complicated process.” The prospect of EU membership has been a powerful force for reforms in the volatile Balkans since the former Yugoslavia disintegrated into war in the early 1990s. North Macedonian President Stevo Pendarovski welcomed Mogherini’s comments, saying he expects his country to “get a fair chance and to transform itself through the opening of each separate chapter” of the accession talks. Until recently known as Macedonia, the country has been an EU candidate member since 2005 but never opened accession talks because of a dispute with Greece. The two neighbours struck a deal last year for Macedonia to rename itself North Macedonia, in exchange for Greece dropping its objections to the country joining NATO and, eventually, the EU. Mogherini warned that Europe is “at a crossroads. We always say that it is a merit-based process, so when merit is assessed as positive it needs to be acknowledged.” “Failure to recognize and respond to objective progress would damage the European Union’s credibility,” she said, adding that it could also “undermine stability and seriously discourage further reforms.” Her warning comes a day after Serbia put its troops on full alert after armed Kosovo police fired tear gas and arrested about two dozen people in Serb-dominated northern Kosovo in what they called an operation against organized crime. EU-backed talks between Serbia and Kosovo on normalizing relations are bogged down.

Three Maltese men are believed to have triggered the powerful car bomb that killed 53-year-old Daphne Caruana Galizia on a road close to her rural home on Oct. 16, 2017. They were ordered two months later to stand trial for murder but the trial has not yet begun and they could soon be released. Nobody has been arrested for ordering the assassination of Ms. Caruana Galizia, who became one of Malta’s best-known journalists for her regular reporting on widespread allegations of corruption on the Mediterranean island that’s a member of the European Union and uses the shared euro currency. In his report for the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, Dutch lawmaker Pieter Omtzigt listed a litany of corruption scandals in Malta, shortcomings in the nation’s legal and judicial system and holdups in the Caruana Galizia investigation. “The police investigation was delayed by the authorities’ refusal to remove an officer with a conflict of interest. The police failed to obtain information from Ms. Caruana Galizia’s laptop when it was offered to them,” he wrote, adding that police also have failed to investigate the prominent public figures that Ms. Caruana Galizia wrote about. “I can fully understand why the Caruana Galizia family has no confidence in the ability of the Maltese authorities to investigate the murder effectively,” Mr. Omtzigt wrote. “There is now a clear need for an independent inquiry.” The Maltese government slammed the report as “riddled with inaccurate and gratuitous statements exposing a very biased agenda which is not based on the true picture of the matter.” In a written statement, the government said Mr. Omtzigt’s report “represents the very biased views of a small fraction of Maltese Opposition politicians.” The report was discussed Wednesday by the legal affairs and human rights committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in Paris. They issued a draft resolution calling for an inquiry that will be sent to a full meeting of the assembly next month in Strasbourg. That draft resolution is likely to be adopted. It is non-binding, but would put pressure on the Maltese government to address its concerns. The 47-nation Council of Europe, which calls itself Europe’s leading human-rights organization, has issued similar resolutions in the past aimed at protecting journalists, notably targeting the governments of Turkey and Russia.

"155"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-nepal-marks-anniversary-of-first-mount-everest-ascent-amid-debate-over/"|"Binaj Gurubacharya"|"Nepal commemorated the anniversary of the first ascent of Mount Everest on Wednesday amid a climbing season marred by the highest death toll in four years and a debate on whether the government should limit permits to prevent dangerous overcrowding on the world’s highest peak. Government officials said at an event in Kathmandu celebrating the successful climb of Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953 that there were no plans to cap permits. Nepal, one of the world’s poorest countries, takes in $300 million each year from climbing. A record number of 381 permits were issued this year. Eleven people have died on Everest, including nine in Nepal, likely due to altitude sickness, which is caused by low amounts of oxygen at high elevation and can lead to headaches, vomiting, shortness of breath and mental confusion. Because of the altitude, climbers have just hours to reach the top before they are at risk of a pulmonary edema, when the lungs fill with liquid causing respiratory failure. Mountaineers described traffic jams caused by exhausted rookies in the “death zone,” the final phase of the ascent from Camp Four at 8,000 metres (26,240 feet) to the 8,850-meter (29,035-foot) peak. The nine deaths this year on Nepal’s side of the mountain included Don Cash, a sales executive from Utah, and Christopher Kulish, an attorney from Colorado, who both died on their way down from the summit. Kulish, 62, had just reached the top with a small group, according to his brother, Mark Kulish. That earned him a place in the “Seven Summit Club” of mountaineers who have reached the highest peaks on every continent, his brother said. Cash, 55, who also joined the Seven Summit Club with his climb, collapsed at the top and was given CPR and massages by his two Sherpa guides. He got up only to fall again in the same way at Hillary Step, the first cliff face down from the summit. Two other climbers – from Ireland and Austria – died on the northern side of the mountain in Chinese territory, according to media reports. On Wednesday, Nepalese government minister Gokul Prasad Baskota said the congestion on Everest wasn’t due to the mismanagement of climbing permits but rather the inadequate training of some climbers. Renowned mountaineer Um Hong-gil of South Korea, who was honoured by the Nepal government at the event commemorating the 66th Everest anniversary, said the number of climbers should be scaled back and only those with proper training and experience should be allowed. “There should definitely be less permits issued and more experienced climbers on Everest,” Um said. He said the endeavour – once only possible for well-heeled elite mountaineers – has changed greatly since he first climbed Everest in 1988, in part because of advanced weather forecasting technology that more accurately predicts clear conditions, leading to pileups at the peak. “Many people are now taking climbing Everest very lightly and as entertainment only, which they think they can do without much training,” Um said. The Nepal Mountaineering Association, an umbrella body of expedition operators, said it would push the government to require climbers to adequately prepare for what Um described as an extremely taxing physical and mental task. “The government needs to come up with strict policies to control the inexperienced climbers from attempting to scale Everest,” said the association’s president, Santa Bir Lama. Lama also faulted private trekking companies that are more focused on expanding their client base than safety. He also said that government permits, which are often issued to climbers just days before their expeditions, should be issued months in advance to give climbers time to fully prepare. A climber from Kashmir who returned to Kathmandu after a failed attempt on Everest agreed that there should be a standard that climbers must meet. “People just throw the cash and get a permit to climb Everest because there are no criteria,” said Rizza Alee. “Lots of people I saw were inexperienced.” Expedition operators said they do vet climbers’ experience and ability before signing up them up and that even seasoned mountaineers sometimes lose their lives on Everest. “In the mountains it is always unpredictable,” said Mingma Sherpa of Seven Summits Treks, one of the biggest expedition companies in Nepal. Sherpa said the government cannot limit the number of permits because of the lasting draw of the world’s highest peak. “People from all over the world would want to come visit Everest and that cannot be stopped,” he said.

"156"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-south-african-president-ramaphosa-appoints-leaner-gender-balanced/"|"Geoffrey York"|"South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has unveiled a smaller, gender-balanced cabinet for his first full term as President, vowing to revitalize South Africa’s slumping economy after winning a reduced majority in national elections this month. Mr. Ramaphosa, in a televised speech to the country on Wednesday night, dumped several corruption-tainted ministers from his cabinet, but retained others in a compromise move that could undercut his pledge to fight graft. One of South Africa’s most controversial politicians, David Mabuza, will retain the post of deputy president in the new Ramaphosa cabinet, despite being the subject of widespread allegations of corruption. The integrity commission of the ruling African National Congress, citing the graft allegations, had questioned whether he should remain in Parliament. Mr. Mabuza stepped down briefly from his parliamentary seat last week, but then returned this week, with his supporters claiming that he had been “cleared” of the corruption allegations. Mr. Ramaphosa announced that he is merging several cabinet ministries to reduce costs. The new cabinet will have 28 ministers, down from 36 in the previous government, and it will be balanced equally between men and women for the first time in South African history, he said. “We need a capable, efficient and ethical government,” Mr. Ramaphosa said. “All South Africans are acutely aware of the great economic difficulties that our country is going through right now, but they are also aware of the constraints that have been placed on our public finances.” Before his election victory this month, in which the ANC won a reduced majority with 57 per cent of the vote, Mr. Ramaphosa had promised a more streamlined cabinet to focus tightly on reviving the stagnant economy. The merger of cabinet ministries is the first step, he said. “This is a significant move of downscaling our state,” he said in his televised speech. “Many people believed that our government, which is meant to serve 57 million people, was bloated.” South Africa’s economy has repeatedly slipped into recession in recent years, and its annual growth has remained below 2 per cent in each the past five years. The International Monetary Fund is projecting growth of just 1.2 per cent this year, barely above the 0.8 per cent growth of last year. The unemployment rate has been stuck at about 27 per cent for several years, with youth unemployment climbing over 50 per cent. Mr. Ramaphosa said he made a deliberate effort to choose younger politicians to serve in his cabinet. “This is part of a generational transition in which we are creating a pipeline of leaders to take our country further into the future,” he said. Despite his promise of a streamlined cabinet, however, he appointed 34 politicians to deputy minister posts. Including the deputy ministers and deputy president, his new executive has 63 members, down only marginally from 72 under his predecessor, Jacob Zuma, who resigned under pressure last year after a corruption scandal. Mr. Ramaphosa’s new cabinet has retained some of his most-respected economic reformers and anti-corruption campaigners, including Finance Minister Tito Mboweni and Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan. But by allowing tainted politicians such as Mr. Mabuza to pass swiftly through the screening process by the ANC’s integrity commission, he has cast doubt on his anti-graft promises. South Africa’s currency, the Rand, lost 2 per cent of its value this week when investors realized that Mr. Mabuza would be staying at his post. They saw it as a signal that Mr. Ramaphosa will be forced to make compromises with ANC factions that oppose his pro-market pledges. Mr. Ramaphosa promised that every cabinet minister will be required to sign “performance agreements” with him, and their performance will be “closely monitored” against clear targets and specific outcomes. If their performance is unsatisfactory, “action will be taken,” he said. “The expectations of the South African people have never been higher or greater.” Mmusi Maimane, leader of the biggest opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, said the cabinet was a “negotiated settlement between factions” in the ruling party. “Ramaphosa placed the internal factional interests of the ANC ahead of the interests of the people of South Africa,” Mr. Maimane said in a statement. “He used cabinet to reward loyal cadres within the ANC.” "|"Ramaphosa unveils a smaller and gender-balanced cabinet for South Africa"|"2019-05-29T16:30:50-0400"|"South African president Cyril Ramaphosa,South African gender balance cabinet,Ramaphosa unveils a smaller and gender-balanced cabinet,South Africa elections,Ramaphosa south africa elections,cent,cabinet,growth,anc,people,week,president,economy,Mmusi Maimane,Democratic Alliance", 
"157"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-deadline-looms-for-israels-netanyahu-to-form-coalition-government/"|"Jeffrey Heller Dan Williams"|"Israeli lawmakers voted to dissolve parliament on Thursday, paving the way for a new election after veteran Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu failed to form a coalition government before a midnight deadline. Netanyahu preferred a new ballot, set for Sept. 17, to the alternative, under which President Reuven Rivlin could have asked another politician to try and form a ruling coalition. But the need to go the polls again so soon after a closely contested April 9 election in which Netanyahu had claimed victory, showed a new weakness in a leader who has been in power for the past decade and who has become the face of Israel for many. Potential indictments in three corruption cases have only deepened questions about his political survival. “We will win,” Netanyahu, 69, head of the right-wing Likud party, vowed after parliament voted when the deadline expired for him to assemble his fifth government. However, he was looking over his shoulder at the Likud benches during the vote in what some commentators interpreted as concern about any last-minute revolt. Not a single Likud lawmaker wavered in voting for an election. With coalition-building potentially stretching into November once that election is over, the uncertainty seems likely to delay further U.S. President Donald Trump’s forthcoming plan to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. At the White House, Trump voiced regret at the political turmoil in Israel and praised Netanyahu, with whom he has been in lockstep in tough policy toward the Palestinians and Iran. “It’s too bad what happened in Israel. It looked like a total win for Netanyahu – who’s a great guy. He’s a great guy. And now they’re back in the debate stage and they’re back in the election stage,” Trump told reporters. The crisis arose – officially, at least – from a feud over military conscription between Netanyahu’s presumed allies: ex-defense minister and far-right secularist Avigdor Lieberman, and ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties. Those parties want young religious scholars exempted en masse from mandatory national service. But Lieberman and many other Israelis say they should share the burden. Faced with the prospect of having to step aside at the end of a 42-day post-election period allowed for putting together a government, Netanyahu instead drummed up support to dissolve the Knesset. He cast Lieberman, a settler in the occupied West Bank, as a leftist for effectively blocking the creation of a right-wing administration and said his erstwhile ally had been out to topple him. In a dig that may foreshadow election campaign attack lines, Lieberman retorted that he lives in a settlement, whereas Netanyahu has a home in a Mediterranean beachfront suburb. “The man from Caesarea is accusing the man from Nokdim of being left-wing?” said Lieberman, head of the Yisrael Beitenu party. In Jerusalem, the White House team behind the Trump peace proposal, including the president’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, held talks with Netanyahu but made no public comment about any time frame for release of the plan. “Even though we had a little event last night,” Netanyahu said, referring to the vote in parliament, “that’s not going to stop us – we’re going to keep working together.” The group is in the Middle East to drum up support for what Kushner styles as an economic workshop in Bahrain next month to encourage investment in the occupied West Bank and Gaza. Even before it has been announced, Palestinians have spurned the plan – described by Trump as “the deal of the century” – as a blow to their statehood hopes. “Now it is the deal of the next century,” Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat told Israel Radio. As the coalition deadline neared, public attention had been focused on pledges by Netanyahu loyalists to push for a vote in the Knesset granting him immunity from criminal prosecution as a member of parliament and to pass a law ensuring such protection cannot be stripped by the Supreme Court. Many opponents and political commentators saw Netanyahu’s push for a new election, before the poll in April and now, as being largely motivated by his legal woes. “It’s astounding how easily one man is taking the entire State of Israel hostage for his own personal gains. We are heading to another election just so that he can escape prosecution,” Gabi Ashkenazi, a member of the centrist Blue and White party and former armed forces head, told Army Radio. Dubbed “crime minister” by foes, Netanyahu denies any wrongdoing in the graft investigations he faces, and has said he aims only to ensure the Supreme Court does not overstep in judging decisions by popularly elected lawmakers. Israel’s attorney general has said he intends to charge Netanyahu with bribery and fraud, pending a pre-trial hearing, which is scheduled for October. First elected in the late 1990s, Netanyahu will overtake Israel’s founding father, David Ben-Gurion, in July as Israel’s longest-serving premier. The last election, in which Netanyahu showcased his warm relations with Trump and frequent contacts with Russian President Vladimir Putin, ended with him neck-and-neck with Benny Gantz, a politically untested ex-armed forces chief and head of Blue and White. But Netanyahu was given the nod to form a government after ultranationalist, right-wing and religious party leaders voiced their support.

"158"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-naval-mines-almost-certainly-from-iran-were-used-to-attack-tankers/"|"Lisa Barrington"|"U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton said on Wednesday that naval mines “almost certainly from Iran” were used to attack oil tankers off the United Arab Emirates this month, and warned Tehran against conducting new operations. Bolton said the “prudent and responsible” approach taken by the United States, which has beefed up its military presence in the region, had made it clear to Iran and its proxies that such actions risked a “very strong” U.S. response. He was speaking to reporters in Abu Dhabi ahead of emergency summits of Arab leaders in Saudi Arabia on Thursday called to discuss the implications of the tanker attacks, and drone strikes two days later, on oil pumping stations in the kingdom. Tehran has denied involvement in either attack and Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi dismissed Bolton’s latest remarks as a “ludicrous claim,” Fars news agency said. The UAE has not yet blamed anyone for the sabotage of four vessels, including two Saudi tankers, near Fujairah emirate, a major bunkering hub just outside the Strait of Hormuz. Riyadh has accused Tehran of ordering the drone strikes, which were claimed by the Iran-aligned Houthis who have been battling a Saudi-led coalition in Yemen in a four-year conflict seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. “I think it is clear these (tanker attacks) were naval mines almost certainly from Iran,” Bolton said without providing evidence. “There is no doubt in anybody’s mind in Washington who is responsible for this and I think it’s important that the leadership in Iran know that we know.” He declined to comment on the specifics of the investigation into the attacks in which the United States, France, Norway and Saudi Arabia are taking part, but said those other countries and ship owners involved could do so. Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister said on Wednesday the attacks on UAE and Saudi oil facilities must be addressed with “strength and firmness” and more efforts were needed to combat the activities of the groups that carried them out. Addressing a meeting of foreign ministers ahead of the summits, he said such attacks were a threat to the global economy, regional and international security. A UAE bunker barge and a Norwegian-registered oil products tanker were also hit. France has a naval base in Abu Dhabi. Bolton said the tanker attacks were connected to the strike on oil pumping stations on the kingdom’s East-West pipeline and a rocket attack on the Green Zone in the Iraqi capital Baghdad. He said there had been a fourth unsuccessful attack on Saudi Arabia’s Yanbu port a few days before the tanker operation but that it was unclear if it was linked to the others. Saudi officials were not immediately available to comment. Bolton and his UAE counterpart announced that a previously signed defence co-operation agreement between the two countries had now come into force, UAE state news agency WAM said, adding it would “enhance military co-ordination” at a critical time. Tensions between the United States and Iran have escalated since U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from a 2015 multinational nuclear pact with Iran and reimposed sanctions, notably targeting Tehran’s key oil exports. Iran says it will not be cowed by what it has called psychological warfare. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani signalled on Wednesday that talks with the United States might be possible if Washington lifted sanctions and met its commitments under the nuclear deal, state television said. Sunni Muslim allies Saudi Arabia and the UAE have backed sanctions against Shi’ite Iran, a fellow OPEC producer but a regional foe, and have lobbied Washington to contain Tehran. Bolton said the United States was discussing next steps with Gulf allies and the goal was “to make it clear to Iran and its surrogates that these kinds of activities risk a very strong response from the Americans.” Washington said it was sending 1,500 troops to the region after speeding up deployment of an aircraft carrier strike group and sending bombers and additional Patriot missiles. Bolton also voiced concern about perceived threats from the overseas arm of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards. “We are very concerned about the Quds Force and Qassem Soleimani using Shi’ite militia groups and others in Iraq as indirect ways to attack our embassy in Baghdad, consulate in Erbil, our various bases around the country,” he said. The U.S. Combined Air Operations Center is based in Qatar and its navy Fifth Fleet in Bahrain. The U.S. Air Force also uses al-Dhafra airbase in Abu Dhabi.

"159"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-warrants-for-irish-investigative-journalists-quashed/"|"Alan Erwin"|"Warrants obtained by police to carry out raids on the homes and offices of two Belfast investigative journalists are to be quashed, Northern Ireland’s High Court ruled in a case that has raised concerns about freedom of the press in the United Kingdom. Trevor Birney and Barry McCaffrey were detained and questioned last August on suspicion of theft. The award-winning journalists had obtained confidential documents from the police ombudsman’s office related to the murders of six Catholic men in Loughinisland in June, 1994. Ulster Volunteer Force gunmen opened fire in a village pub as their victims watched a World Cup soccer match. Despite widespread claims that police know the identities of the shooters, no one has been convicted in the massacre. Mr. Birney and Mr. McCaffrey named alleged killers and highlighted suspected collusion between police and the UVF. Senior judges on Wednesday held that authorization for the police searches had been inappropriate. A further hearing later this week will determine whether documents seized should be returned. The outcome represents a victory for Mr. Birney and Mr. McCaffrey in their challenge to the legality of warrants. After a two-day hearing, Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan confirmed: "We are minded to quash the warrants on the basis that they were inappropriate, whatever the other arguments.” During the hearing, lawyers for the two journalists had contended that the search operation was aimed at discovering sources and intimidating whistle-blowers. Judges were told the raids were an “outrage” more akin to a police state than a liberal democracy. The journalists were involved in the documentary film No Stone Unturned, which examined the Royal Ulster Constabulary’s handling of the Loughinisland massacre. The pair have been out on bail awaiting charges since last summer’s raid undertaken by detectives from Durham Constabulary, supported by officers from the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI). All of the seized material remains under seal, with police having given an undertaking not to examine any of the documents and computer equipment pending the outcome of the legal action. Outside court, Mr. Birney said that, after the release of No Stone Unturned in 2017, police focused on the journalists, instead of those responsible for the killings at Loughinisland. “That speaks volumes about where priorities lay for the senior ranks of the PSNI,” he said. “Why did they make the focus of their investigations two journalists, rather than using their resources to go after the killers and trying to bring justice to the Loughinisland families almost 25 years later?” Describing the police operation as an attempt to “send a chill factor through journalists investigating the past in Northern Ireland,” Mr. Birney insisted all material seized must now be returned. He added: “They should hand back the millions of documents, computers, laptops and also the mobile phones belonging to my children that they took from my home.” At the hearing, it was stressed that police were made aware the film was being made, with the intention of naming suspects whose identities have been in the public domain for more than two decades. With no attempt made to seek a court injunction to stop the documentary, suspects were also notified and offered an opportunity to respond. On Day 2 of the case, counsel for the police forces under challenge argued that the warrants were sought amid concerns the material would be destroyed. Peter Coll told the court detectives were focused only on probing potential offences linked to a leak from the ombudsman’s office. “It doesn’t translate into an opportunity to attack investigative journalism or an opportunity to try and inhibit and stymie and stifle freedom of expression,” he said. “The purpose of the investigation is to deal with the criminality that arises from disclosure of these documents.” He also suggested consequences for comprising the secrecy and protection to those who provide the authorities with covert intelligence. “They will simply take the view that if I provide information to the state, there’s a leaky ship in PONI [Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland] and I can’t be assured my identity is not going to end up at some stage in the newspapers or written on a wall,” Mr. Coll said. But in reply, Barry Macdonald, counsel for Mr. Birney, set out details of an alleged reaction from Durham Police to his client meeting a cross-section of MPs at the Houses of Parliament. The court heard claims that a “foul and abusive” phone call was made to the offices of MP Grahame Morris from someone purporting to be a senior officer in the constabulary who “ranted about his meeting with ‘terrorists and criminals.’” Mr Macdonald submitted: “That is obviously completely out of order, but it’s reflective of a police officer in charge of this investigation who is, at the very least, overzealous.” "|"Warrants for Irish investigative journalists quashed"|"2019-05-29T20:41:25-0400"|"warrants,belfast,Northern Ireland,United Kingdom,investigative journalists,massacre,killers,collusion,murder,village pub,ombudsman,police,opportunity,hearing,office", 
"160"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-caster-semenya-files-appeal-over-ruling-that-limits-testosterone-in/"|"Paul Waldie"|"South African runner Caster Semenya has launched a new legal challenge to a move by the global governing body for track and field to restrict testosterone levels for some female athletes. Semenya announced on Wednesday that she will appeal a recent ruling of the Switzerland-based Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), which upheld a testosterone regulation adopted by the International Association of Athletics Federations. The IAAF regulation came into force on May 8 and it sets a specific testosterone level for female athletes competing in races from 400 metres to one mile. If a runner exceeds the level set by the federation, she must take drugs to lower her testosterone or compete against men. The ruling has been closely watched by other sports organizations and the International Olympic Committee, which is considering introducing a similar threshold for transgender athletes competing at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. Semenya, a two time Olympic champion in the 800 metres, has differences of sex development, or DSD, which causes her to have a high level of testosterone. She has been battling the IAAF for years over the issue and has vowed to ignore the new regulation. “I am a woman and I am a world-class athlete. The IAAF will not drug me or stop me from being who I am,” she said in a statement on Wednesday. The appeal has been filed in Switzerland’s Federal Supreme Court and Semenya’s lawyers will argue that the IAAF’s regulation violates “widely recognized public policy values, including the prohibition against discrimination, the right to physical integrity, the right to economic freedom, and respect for human dignity." The IAAF’s rule goes against the “principles of Swiss public policy,” her lawyers said in a statement. "In the race for justice, human rights must win over sporting interests,” added Dorothee Schramm, a Geneva-based lawyer who is part of Semenya’s legal team, which also includes Toronto lawyer James Bunting. It’s unclear whether Semenya’s lawyers will seek a court order suspending the implementation of the IAAF regulation while the appeal is being heard. The IAAF has long argued that testosterone is a key determinant in athletic performance because it helps build muscle and bone mass. In its decision, the CAS panel found by a 2-1 majority that while the IAAF’s mandatory threshold for the hormone was discriminatory, that discrimination was necessary and reasonable to ensure “fair competition in female athletics in certain events.” It also said that while many factors go into athletic performance – such as training facilities, coaching and other genetic attributes – DSD athletes have testosterone levels approaching the male range, which gives them a significant performance advantage over other female athletes. However, the panel also raised questions about how the IAAF policy will be implemented and whether taking drugs will work. The ruling caused an outcry in South Africa and the government had promised an appeal would be launched. The World Medical Association, which represents national medical organisations in 114 countries, condemned the decision and called on doctors to refuse to co-operate with the IAAF in implementing the regulation. The WMA said medical treatment “is only justified when there is a medical need,” and it added: “The mere existence of an intersex condition, without the person indicating suffering and expressing the desire for an adequate treatment, does not constitute a medical indication.” In Canada, the governing body for track and field, Athletics Canada, said it would not implement the IAAF regulation for domestic competitions and the Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sport called the ruling discriminatory and noted that no similar restriction exists for men. The IAAF has stood by the regulation and several high-profile athletes, including marathon world record-holder, Paula Radcliffe, have said the CAS decision will help protect women’s sport. The IAAF has also insisted that the rule is based on several studies and “observations from the field” during the past 15 years. And it said that it is not uncommon for some DSD women to lower their level of testosterone as a health precaution by taking contraceptive pills since some types of DSD carry a greater risk of cancer.

"161"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-huawei-quietly-launches-5g-lab-in-south-korea/"|"Ju-min Park"|"Huawei Technologies unveiled an open lab for next-generation 5G wireless network in South Korea on Thursday, but kept the launch low-key given its recent blacklisting by the United States, a key security ally of the Asian nation. The Chinese tech giant, the world’s top producer of telecoms equipment, said it planned to invest about $5 million in the lab in the Junggu district of Seoul. It did not provide any more details on the location and did not invite media to the launch. “Based on the philosophy of “In Korea and for Korea” and the strength of its own 5G network, Huawei will build a 5G ecosystem through cooperation with a number of South Korean ICT companies and especially small-and-medium enterprises,” Huawei’s Korea office said in a statement. The event was, however, overshadowed by the U.S. decision earlier this month to ban American tech and telecom firms from doing business with Huawei. Washington has also been urging its allies to bar the Chinese company from their 5G networks. Huawei had initially considered inviting the press to the launch in South Korea, but after the U.S. ban it decided to keep the event low-key, a person with knowledge of the matter said. “Huawei wanted to promote the launch to as many Korean small-and-medium enterprises as possible, but it decided to keep the press out after the ban to avoid any damage to its Korean partners in case they are shown in media,” the person said, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. Huawei said the heads of South Korean enterprises attended the event, but did not disclose any names. The move underlines Huawei’s commitment to South Korea from where it purchases components such as chips and screens. The U.S. campaign against Huawei, and the broader U.S.-China trade war, have landed export-driven South Korea in a familiar bind, caught between its crucial security ally and biggest trading partner. The lab in South Korea is Huawei’s first open 5G services development centre in the world that will allow other companies to test their platforms, according to the company. South Korea rolled out 5G services in April, hoping the next-generation wireless technology will spur breakthrough in fields such as autonomous cars. Currently, Huawei provides its 5G network equipment for a small South Korean carrier LG Uplus. LG Uplus has said it does not plan to remove Huawei gear, but promised to step up security checks. The two bigger carriers, SK Telecom and KT, do not use Huawei gear.

"162"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-mozambique-seeks-32-billion-to-recover-from-pair-of-powerful/"|"Cara Anna"|"Mozambique says it needs $3.2-billion to recover from a pair of powerful tropical cyclones that ripped into the southern African nation earlier this year and left hundreds dead, raising alarm about the effects of climate change on coastal nations. That’s according to a government assessment supported by the World Bank, United Nations and European Union for a global pledging conference that begins on Friday. Some aid workers fear the worst is yet to come. The storms wiped out crops on the eve of harvest in one of the world’s least developed countries, and many people must rely on food aid well into next year. More than 1.3 million people are said to require emergency food assistance. Cyclones Idai and Kenneth killed more than 650 people in Mozambique, plus hundreds of others in Zimbabwe and Malawi. A final death toll may never be known as some bodies were washed away. It was the first time in recorded history that two tropical cyclones struck Mozambique in a single season, with one making landfall farther north than ever recorded. The country’s 2,400-kilometre (1,500-mile) Indian Ocean coastline is one of the world’s most vulnerable to global warming. The cyclones will worsen poverty in the region and recovery will be “extremely challenging,” the government assessment says. “It’s getting worse with time, steadily,” Mahmoud Shabeeb, spokesman with the aid organization CARE, told The Associated Press, saying the next harvest season isn’t until March of next year. “If people receive assistance, they eat. If not, they don’t eat.” Cyclone Idai in mid-March brought widespread flooding that created an “inland ocean” and left panicked residents clinging to rooftops and trees for days across central Mozambique, the country’s breadbasket. In the region’s main city of Beira, population roughly 500,000, many rooftops were peeled away. Six weeks later Kenneth arrived in the northernmost province of Cabo Delgado, shocking residents who had never experienced such a powerful storm. A long swathe of coastal communities was destroyed, and some areas are still difficult or impossible to reach. “The sound was like a pack of angry wolves,” Ahmad Baroudi, a spokesman with the aid group Save the Children, told the AP after visiting devastated Ibo island and hearing accounts of the storm. Residents told him how they had struggled to put one foot in front of the other in the hurricane-force winds, and how everyone – even those not thought to be religious – were praying. The cyclones’ effects on children have been widespread, Baroudi said. Fewer are going to school. Some are exposed to abuse and neglect. Some must work or engage in “survival sex.” Many are drinking unsafe water. Livelihoods have been destroyed. “This response is surprisingly underfunded,” he said. Just 30 per cent of the UN humanitarian appeal for Mozambique has come in. “This (pledging) conference comes really at a crucial time.” "|"Mozambique seeks $3.2-billion to recover from pair of powerful cyclones "|"2019-05-30T08:05:04-0400"|"Mozambique,Mozambique aid,Cyclone,Cyclone Idai,Cyclone Kenneth,news,world,World Bank,UN,EU,people,mozambique,nation,time,country",

No militant group immediately claimed responsibility for the bombing but both the Taliban and Islamic State militants regularly target Afghan forces. The Mashal Fahim academy, located in a western Kabul neighbourhood, has been attacked in the past. The Interior Ministry said a soldier had noticed a suspicious person and as he approached him, the attacker detonated his explosives near the academy. If the bomber had come closer, the number of casualties could have been much higher, a security official said, adding that the academy cadets were getting ready to leave for their weekend. The official spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations. Police quickly sealed off the attack site. Ferdus Faramarz, spokesman for the Kabul police chief, said an investigation was underway. Last year, IS militants attacked the academy – sometimes called “Sandhurst in the Sand” in reference to the famous British school – and killed at least 11 troops. It’s named for Mohammed Fahim, the country’s late vice-president and a military commander of the Northern Alliance that fought the Taliban. It was inaugurated in 2013 and British troops in Afghanistan oversaw the establishing of the academy’s officer school and training program. The academy was also the site where Army Maj Gen. Harold J. Greene lost his life – the highest-ranking U.S. military officer to be killed in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Greene, then deputy commander of NATO’s transition force in the country, was shot and killed by an Afghan soldier in a so-called “insider attack” that was later claimed by the Taliban in August 2014. Separately, the Interior Ministry said Thursday that Afghan special forces rescued at least 28 people from a Taliban-run prison in Nawbahar district in southern Zabul province in the morning hours. It said 16 civilians and 12 members of the security forces were freed in the operation, which involved a gunbattle with the Taliban that also left two insurgents dead.

"164"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-san-diego-hospital-announces-birth-of-what-is-believed-to-be-the-world/"|""|"When she was born, the baby girl weighed about the same as an apple. A San Diego hospital on Wednesday revealed the birth of the girl and said she is believed to be the world’s tiniest surviving micro-preemie, who weighed just 8.6 ounces (245 grams) when she was born in December. The girl was born 23 weeks and three days into her mother’s 40-week pregnancy. Doctors told her father after the birth that he would have about an hour with his daughter before she died. “But that hour turned into two hours, which turned into a day, which turned into a week,” the mother said in a video released by Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women & Newborns. More than five months have passed, and she has gone home as a healthy infant, weighing 5 pounds (2 kilograms). The baby’s family gave permission to share the story but wanted to stay anonymous, the hospital said. They allowed the girl to go by the name that nurses called her: “Saybie.” Her ranking as the world’s smallest baby ever to survive is according to the Tiniest Baby Registry maintained by the University of Iowa. Dr. Edward Bell, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Iowa, said Saybie had the lowest medically confirmed birth weight submitted to the registry. But “we cannot rule out even smaller infants who have not been reported to the Registry,” he said in an e-mail to The Associated Press. The hospital said the girl officially weighed 7 grams less than the previous tiniest baby, who was born in Germany in 2015. In the video produced by the hospital, the mother described the birth as the scariest day of her life. She said she was taken to the hospital after not feeling well and was told she had pre-eclampsia, a serious condition that causes skyrocketing blood pressure, and that the baby needed to be delivered quickly. “I kept telling them she’s not going to survive, she’s only 23 weeks,” the mother said. But she did. The tiny girl slowly gained weight in the neonatal intensive care unit. A pink sign by her crib read “Tiny but Mighty.” Other signs kept track of her weight and cheered her on as the girl, whose birth weight compared to that of a hamster, gained pounds over the months. “You could barely see her in the bed she was so tiny,” nurse Emma Wiest said in the video. It shows photos of Saybie wearing a mint bow with white polka dots that covered her entire head, her tiny eyes peering out from under it. Nurses put a tiny graduation cap on her when she left the unit. The girl faces enormous challenges as a micro-preemie, who is an infant born before 28 weeks of gestation. Micro-preemies can experience vision and hearing problems, developmental issues and a host of other complications. Many do not survive the first year, said Michelle Kling of the March of Dimes, a non-profit that works to improve the health of mothers and babies. So far Saybie has beaten the odds. “She’s a miracle, that’s for sure,” said Kim Norby, another nurse featured in the video.

"165"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-saudi-arabia-urges-muslim-nations-to-respond-to-iran-with-force-and/"|"Aya Batrawy"|"Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister on Thursday urged Muslim nations to confront with “all means of force and firmness” recent attacks in the Persian Gulf that U.S. and some Arab officials have blamed on Iran. Ibrahim al-Assaf made the comments at a preparatory meeting of foreign ministers of the 57-nation Organization of Islamic Cooperation, or OIC, ahead of a trio of summits in the kingdom’s holy city of Mecca. Saudi Arabia hastily called for the meetings in response to the spike in tensions with its key rival, Iran. That King Salman could quickly bring regional leaders and heads of state to Mecca so rapidly reflects the kingdom’s weight in the region and its desire to project a unified position on Iran. The summits coincide with the final days of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, a time of intense worship when Muslims believe the Qur’an was first revealed to the Prophet Muhammad some 1,400 years ago. Saudi Arabia will seek to use to the optics of the Mecca gatherings to send a clear and powerful message to Iran, which itself is also a member of the OIC. In his opening remarks, al-Assaf said the alleged sabotage of oil tankers off the coast of the United Arab Emirates and a drone attack on a Saudi oil pipeline by Yemen’s Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in recent weeks threaten the global economy and endanger regional and international security. “We should confront it with all means of force and firmness,” he said. Upon their arrival at the airport, each leader was shown Houthi military items, such as a destroyed drone, missiles and mortar shells used in the conflict with the Saudis. The leaders were given a brief explanation of the weapons on display by Col. Turki al-Maliki, spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition at war in Yemen. An Iranian official was at the OIC meeting where al-Assaf spoke Thursday, but Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif did not attend. Iran denies being involved in the attacks, which come amid heightened tensions between Tehran and the U.S. The crisis has root in the Trump administration’s decision to withdraw last year from Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers. The first of the three summits will start with a meeting of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council on Thursday evening. Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Nasser Al Thani was expected to attend, making it the highest-level visit to Saudi Arabia by a Qatari official since 2017, when the kingdom and three other Arab states cut off ties with the tiny energy-rich Gulf state over its foreign policies. The GCC meeting will be immediately followed with an emergency summit of the 22-nation Arab League, minus Syria whose membership remains suspended. The third and final summit, on Friday, is expected to focus largely on Palestinian statehood and independence. It will bring together leaders from the 57-nation OIC, which is headquartered in Saudi Arabia. In his remarks, al-Assaf reiterated Saudi Arabia’s long-standing position on the two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict. His comments come as the White House tries to sell its Mideast plan to Arab leaders ahead of a conference in Bahrain next month that the Palestinian leadership is boycotting. Among those attending are Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, Lebanon’s Prime Minister Saad Hariri, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Sabah Al Sabah, and Abdel-Fattah Burhan, the head of Sudan’s ruling military council. It marks the first international conference for Burhan since the ouster of long-time leader Omar al-Bashir from power in April. Also participating is Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, whose country has uneasy ties with Saudi Arabia, particularly after the killing of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul last year. Al-Assaf’s comments on Iran appeared to mirror remarks made by President Donald Trump’s national security adviser, John Botlon, who warned Iran on Wednesday that any attacks in the Persian Gulf will draw a “very strong response” from the U.S. Speaking to journalists in the UAE, Bolton said there had been a previously unknown attempt to attack the Saudi oil port of Yanbu as well, which he also blamed on Iran. Referring to U.S. deployments of an aircraft carrier and B-52 bombers to the Persian Gulf, Bolton said: “The point is to make it very clear to Iran and its surrogates that these kinds of action risk a very strong response from the United States.” For years before becoming national security adviser, Bolton called for overthrowing Iran’s government in interviews and in paid speaking engagements before an Iranian exile group. Meanwhile, Trump said this week the U.S. wasn’t “looking to hurt Iran at all.” During a visit to Tokyo this week, Trump appeared to welcome negotiations with Iran. “We’re not looking for regime change – I just want to make that clear,” Trump said. “We’re looking for no nuclear weapons.” Also on Wednesday, acting U.S. Defence Secretary Patrick Shanahan said some 900 troops would be deployed to Qatar and Saudi Arabia to reinforce the tens of thousands already in the Middle East. Another 600 have had their deployment in the region extended. “The Iranian threat to our forces in the region remains,” Shanahan said. It’s unclear how many of those troops would be sent to Saudi Arabia. Sending a large number of troops to Saudi Arabia could potentially spark a backlash from Muslims around the world because the country is also home to Islam’s two holiest sites in Mecca and Medina. Osama bin Laden’s al-Qaeda launched the Sept. 11 attacks, in part over America’s military presence in the kingdom. The late King Abdullah refused to allow U.S. bases in Saudi Arabia for the Iraq invasion in 2003, though he permitted them during the first Gulf War in 1991.

Brigitte Bierlein, who is due to reach the court’s mandatory retirement age of 70 this year, will be tasked with putting together a cabinet that will have parliament’s backing until the next election, which is expected to be held in September. She will be Austria’s first female chancellor. “The most important goal is currently to contribute to greater calm and to building trust between all (political) sides ... in Austria, in Europe and in the whole world,” Bierlein said in remarks to the media with President Alexander Van der Bellen on Thursday. Van der Bellen’s pick is what had been widely expected – a veteran civil servant not involved in day-to-day politics – though many judges are close to a party, and Kurz’s right-wing coalition government proposed Bierlein as the court’s chief. He said he and Bierlein, whom he plans to formally appoint along with her cabinet within days, had agreed to pick mainly civil servants as ministers. Bierlein said she had chosen Alexander Schallenberg, a diplomat who worked as a senior official in Kurz’s office, as foreign minister. “In the coming months we will, no doubt, not see any big, lasting legislative initiatives. It is much more about a good and orderly administration of state affairs,” Van der Bellen said.

President Ram Nath Kovind administered the oath to Modi and his Cabinet ministers. Missing from the new Cabinet were former External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, who stepped aside for health reasons. The portfolios of the Cabinet ministers were expected to be announced later Thursday. They include new appointee Amit Shah, who has headed Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party as president since 2014. In the recent elections, Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party won 303 seats in the 542-member lower house of Parliament, giving him huge authority. However, he faces immense challenges including a slowing economy, high 6.2 per cent unemployment and low agricultural prices that have hurt farmers. The opposition Congress party, which had dominated Indian politics since the country won independence from Britain in 1947, was reduced to 52 seats. Its key leaders, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, attended Thursday’s ceremony at the presidential palace. The ceremony was attended by several South Asian and Southeast Asian leaders as part of Modi’s effort to build economic partnerships in the region. Modi did not invite Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, signifying that tense relations continue between the nuclear-armed rivals. Modi has been demanding an end to Pakistan’s support for insurgent groups which attack Indian forces and installations in disputed Kashmir. Pakistan says it provides only moral and diplomatic support to these groups. Modi invited then-Pakistani Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, for his swearing-in ceremony in 2014. But hostility between the two nations, which have fought three wars since winning independence from Britain in 1947, has not eased in the past five years.

Volodymyr Zelensky, the comedian who won a landslide victory in last month’s presidential election, faces a hostile parliament dominated by former President Petro Poroshenko’s supporters. Zelensky called snap parliamentary elections for July 21 in a bid to get more of his supporters into parliament. In anticipation of that, lawmakers have sought to block the president’s efforts to form a more loyal Cabinet. The Verkhovna Rada refused on Thursday to accept the resignation of Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman, keeping his Cabinet in place. That vote follows the parliament turning down a proposal by Zelensky to amend the electoral law last week. Despite the Rada’s resistance, Zelensky on Thursday asked parliament to dismiss three top Poroshenko loyalists – Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin, Defence Minister Stepan Poltorak and SBU Security service chief Vasyl Gritsak. A date has not yet been set for a vote. Zelensky also has called for the dismissal of Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko – a move that would similarly require parliamentary approval. Also Thursday, Zelensky met with German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas and French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian. After the meeting Maas and Le Drian issued a joint statement saying they would work toward arranging a summit of the leaders of the countries in the “Normandy format” talks on resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany are participants in those talks, which have shown little progress.

At least six improvised explosive devices went off in the northern city and two more were defused by security forces, the Iraqi military said in a statement. It gave a lower death toll of three and said 16 were injured. The explosion sites included two malls, an ice cream shop and a butcher’s shop, local media reported. There was no immediate claim of responsibility but Islamic State militants are active in the area. Iraq declared victory over the group, which once held large swathes of the country, in December 2017. But Islamic State has switched to hit-and-run attacks aimed at undermining the Baghdad government. Its fighters have regrouped in the Hamrin mountain range in the northeast, which extends from Diyala province, on the border with Iran, crossing northern Salahuddin province and southern Kirkuk.

"170"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-leon-redbone-acclaimed-1970s-musician-dies/"|"Mesfin Fekadu"|"Leon Redbone, the acclaimed singer and guitarist who performed jazz, ragtime and Tin Pan Alley-style songs, died Thursday, according to a statement released by his family. He was 69. No details about his death were provided. Redbone’s career got a boost in the early 1970s when Bob Dylan met him at the Mariposa Folk Festival in Ontario, Canada, and praised his performance. Dylan said that if he ever started a label, he would have signed Redbone. “Leon interests me,” Dylan said in an interview with Rolling Stone in 1974. “I’ve heard he’s anywhere from 25 to 60, I’ve been (a foot and a half from him) and I can’t tell, but you gotta see him. He does old Jimmie Rodgers, then turns around and does a Robert Johnson.” Dylan wasn’t the only one who didn’t know Redbone’s real age since the performer never directly answered questions about his origin or age. Redbone’s publicist confirmed he was born in Cyprus on Aug. 26, 1949, but the Thursday statement announcing his death explained that “Leon Redbone crossed the delta for that beautiful shore at the age of 127. He departed our world with his guitar, his trusty companion Rover, and a simple tip of his hat.” “I don’t do anything mysterious on purpose. I’m less than forthcoming, but that doesn’t necessarily mean I’m mysterious. It just means I’m not inclined to go there,” Redbone was quoted saying in the press release that announced his death. Redbone retired from performing in 2015 because his health had “been a matter of concern for some time,” a spokesman for the singer said at the time, and it was “too challenging for him to continue the full range of professional activities.” He released his debut album, “On the Track,” in 1975, and dropped 16 albums throughout his career. Most often dressed in a white suit with a string tie, wearing glasses and a panama hat, Redbone performed twice on “Saturday Night Live” in its first season (1975-1976) and was a frequent guest on “The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.” He voiced Leon the Snowman in the 2003 Christmas comedy “Elf,” starring Will Ferrell, and sang “Baby, It’s Cold Outside,” a duet with Zooey Deschanel, for the film. Redbone also sang the theme song for the TV series “Mr. Belvedere” and “Harry and the Hendersons.” A 16-minute documentary about his life aptly titled “Please Don’t Talk About Me When I’m Gone” was released last year.

The United States is seeking the extradition of Mr. Assange, 47, who was dragged from the Ecuadorean embassy in London on April 11. He faces a total of 18 U.S. criminal counts and decades in prison if convicted. “He’s in fact far from well,” Mr. Assange’s lawyer, Gareth Peirce told Westminster Magistrates’ Court. She earlier told Reuters he was too ill to attend the hearing by videolink. Justice Emma Arbuthnot, who was presiding over the case, added: “He’s not very well.” WikiLeaks said it had grave concerns about Mr. Assange’s health and that he had been moved to a health ward at London’s Belmarsh high-security prison. “During the seven weeks in Belmarsh his health has continued to deteriorate and he has dramatically lost weight,” it added in a statement. “The decision of prison authorities to move him to the health ward speaks for itself.” Britain’s Ministry of Justice said it could not comment on individual prisoners. However, a government source said that although Mr. Assange was on the prison’s health wing, he was eating normally and was receiving the same diet as other inmates. The next hearing on the extradition request was set for June 12. Mr. Assange, who spent almost seven years holed up in cramped rooms at the Ecuadorean embassy in London, has repeatedly said he fears extradition to the United States. His admirers hail him as a hero for exposing what they describe as abuse of power by modern states and for championing free speech. His detractors paint him as a dangerous figure complicit in Russian efforts to undermine the West and U.S. security, and dispute that he is a journalist. Earlier this month, he was sentenced to 50 weeks in prison by a British court for skipping bail after fleeing to the Ecuadorean embassy. The United States has charged Mr. Assange with espionage, saying he unlawfully published the names of classified sources and conspired with and assisted ex-Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning in obtaining access to classified information. The U.S. Justice Department has said that by publishing their identities, he jeopardized the lives of sources that included Afghans, Iraqis, journalists, religious leaders, human rights advocates and political dissidents from repressive regimes. WikiLeaks angered Washington by publishing hundreds of thousands of secret U.S. diplomatic cables that laid bare critical U.S. appraisals of world leaders, from Russian President Vladimir Putin to members of the Saudi royal family. Mr. Assange made international headlines in 2010 when WikiLeaks published a classified U.S. military video showing a 2007 attack by Apache helicopters in Baghdad that killed a dozen people, including two Reuters news staff.

"172"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-kremlin-says-its-turkeys-responsibility-to-stop-rebels-in-syrias/"|"Maria Tsvetkova Ece Toksabay"|"The Kremlin said on Friday it was Turkey’s responsibility to stop rebels in Syria’s Idlib province from firing on civilian and Russian targets, signalling it would continue to back a Syrian government offensive there despite Ankara’s protests. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan told his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin late on Thursday that he wanted a ceasefire in Idlib to prevent more civilian deaths and a refugee influx to Turkey. Erdogan also told Putin by phone that Syria needed a political solution, Erdogan’s office said in a statement. The Turkish leader has repeatedly complained to Moscow about a Russian-backed Syrian government offensive in the rebel-held northwest, the most serious escalation of the war between President Bashar al-Assad and his enemies since last summer. The fighting has uprooted around 250,000 people in the territory, the last significant rebel stronghold, and one which borders Turkey. The Kremlin made clear on Friday however that it was for now unmoved by Erdogan’s calls for a ceasefire, saying the rebels were the ones who had to implement a ceasefire in the first instance. “We really do need a ceasefire in Idlib and what needs to be achieved is for the terrorists to stop firing on civilian targets and on certain facilities where our troops are located,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters when asked about Erdogan’s request for a ceasefire. “...This is the responsibility of the Turkish side.” Russia has complained of rocket and drone attacks against its main Hmeymim air base being launched from Idlib, something Peskov described as “a highly dangerous tendency”. He made no mention of the idea that Syrian government troops, backed by Russian air power, should stop fighting however, but denied Moscow and Ankara disagreed over Idlib. The fate of the province has strained relations between Russia and Turkey, which is keen to retain a degree of influence there given its geographical proximity. Moscow, one of the Syrian government’s staunchest allies, and Turkey brokered a deal in September to create a demilitarised zone in Idlib that would be free of all heavy weapons and jihadist fighters. But Moscow, which is keen to help Assad retake territory, has since complained about escalating violence in the area and said that militants who used to belong to the Nusra Front group are in control of large swaths of territory. It has blamed Turkey for not doing enough to hold its side of the bargain, while Ankara, which is worried about refugees crossing from Idlib into Turkey, has repeatedly urged restraint.

"173"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-extinction-rebellion-considers-using-drones-to-shut-londons-heathrow-2/"|"Matthew Green"|"Climate activists from Extinction Rebellion have drawn up plans to use drones to shut London’s Heathrow Airport this summer in a campaign to stop the construction of a third runway at Europe’s busiest airport, the group said. The internal proposal, seen by Reuters, emerged against a backdrop of renewed campaigning by environmental groups who argue that expanding Heathrow would be incompatible with Britain’s targets to curb greenhouse gas emissions. “On June 18, we plan to carry out nonviolent direct action to ensure Heathrow Authorities close the airport for the day, to create a ‘pause’ in recognition of the genocidal impact of high carbon activities, such as flying, upon the natural world,” Extinction Rebellion said in a statement late on Thursday. “This is not about targeting the public, but holding the Government to their duty to take leadership on the climate and ecological emergency,” the group said. Heathrow Airport said the use of drones would be a “reckless action”. “We agree with the need to act on climate change, but that requires us to work together constructively – not commit serious criminal offences just as hard-working people prepare to spend a well-earned holiday with their family and friends,” an airport spokesman said in a statement on Friday. The deployment of drones would mark a significant escalation by Extinction Rebellion, which mobilized thousands of people in a peaceful civil disobedience campaign that brought parts of central London to a standstill for 11 days in April. The British parliament declared a symbolic ‘climate emergency’ in response to the protests, raising hopes among campaign groups that the government will cancel the third runway as part of more ambitious climate commitments. British security forces have been on alert since December, when Gatwick Airport outside London was forced to cancel flights over several days due to drones near the perimeter. Extinction Rebellion was not involved in that incident, senior members of the movement said at the time. In the internal proposal written by volunteers, activists suggested using drones to force authorities to ground flights at Heathrow Airport while other protesters held picnics. The activists said they would avoid any risk to aircraft by informing the airport of their plans in advance. If the government does not cede to their demands after disruption on June 18, the activists proposed shutting the airport for the first two weeks in July. Extinction Rebellion’s commitment to non-violent civil disobedience to press for faster cuts in greenhouse gas emissions has spurred offshoots in more than a dozen countries and pushed climate change up the political agenda. Nevertheless, the planned Heathrow action has divided opinion within the movement. Some volunteers believe that governments will only treat the climate crisis with sufficient urgency if faced with large-scale disruption, including to transport networks such as underground railways and airports. Others fear that disrupting air travel may alienate large numbers of people who might otherwise have been sympathetic to the movement’s demands at a time when scientists are sounding increasingly urgent alarms about the risk of climate breakdown. As a self-organizing, highly decentralized movement, Extinction Rebellion volunteers have a lot of autonomy, making it hard to predict whether the drone proposal will win enough support to proceed. Britain’s parliament backed the plan to build an $18-billion third runway last year. Heathrow Airport is owned by Ferrovial, Qatar Investment Authority and China Investment Corporation, among others.

"174"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-cargo-ship-arrives-in-philippines-to-return-containers-of-garbage-to/"|"Aaron Favila"|"The Philippines on Friday shipped 69 containers of what its officials called illegally transported garbage back to Canada, one of two Southeast Asian countries that have protested being treated like dumpsites by wealthier countries. Administrator Wilma Eisma of Subic Bay freeport said the tons of garbage were loaded overnight on the container ship M/V Bavaria, which left on a 20-day journey to the Canadian port city of Vancouver and ended a “sordid chapter in our history.” The Bavaria will stop at a Taiwanese port before heading to Canada, she said. Environmental activists, including those from Greenpeace and EcoWaste Coalition, welcomed the Bavaria’s arrival at Subic Bay, and on Thursday sailed on board a small outrigger with a streamer reading, “Philippines: not a garbage dumping ground!” President Rodrigo Duterte had threatened to forcibly ship back the trash, which officials said was transported to the Philippines in 103 containers in 2013 to 2014, and falsely declared as recyclable plastic scraps. Several containers of the trash had been disposed off, including in a landfill, leaving 69 containers of electrical and household waste, including used diapers, rotting in two Philippine ports. The Philippine government recalled its ambassador and consuls in Canada earlier this month over Ottawa’s failure to comply with a May 15 deadline to take back the waste. “I think the message that we’re sending to the world is that we will not be a pushover and, moreover, that the president is really somebody to reckon with,” Eisma told The Associated Press. The return of the garbage removes a six-year thorn in relations between the two countries, especially under Duterte, a temperamental leader who took office in mid-2016. He has resented international criticism, including by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, of his bloody crackdown on illegal drugs that has left thousands of mostly poor suspects dead. The countries had sought to resolve the problem for years, with Trudeau saying in 2017 that legal issues preventing the return of the garbage had been resolved. The return, however, was delayed by other issues despite Canadian assurances of its willingness to take back the garbage that Trudeau said was shipped to Manila in a private commercial transaction. Last week, Canadian Environment Minister Catherine McKenna said the government had awarded a contract to French shipping giant Bollore Logistics Canada, calling for the return of the containers by the end of June. But presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo rejected the plan, saying the Duterte administration would look for a private shipping company to transport the garbage sooner. “If Canada will not accept their trash, we will leave the same within its territorial waters,” Panelo said. “The president’s stance is as principled as it is uncompromising: The Philippines as an independent sovereign nation must not be treated as trash by other foreign nations.” Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has also criticized the practice of wealthier countries such as the United States, Canada and Japan sending their non-recyclable waste to poorer countries. Speaking in Tokyo on Thursday, Mahathir said it was “grossly unfair” and should stop. His comments came a few days after his government announced plans to return thousands of tons of plastic waste to mostly Western countries. China banned the import of plastic waste last year, causing other Southeast Asian nations to become new destinations. Philippine environmental groups urged the Duterte administration on Thursday to ban all imports of waste and ratify the Basel Ban Amendment, which prohibits the import of waste for any reason, including recycling. They cited the discovery of other waste shipments to the Philippines from South Korea in 2018 and more recently from Australia and Hong Kong. The garbage issue has been the latest strain in Philippine relations with Canada under Duterte. Last year, he cancelled a multimillion-dollar agreement to buy 16 helicopters from Canada after Trudeau’s government decided to review the deal due to concerns that the Philippine military might use the aircraft in counterinsurgency assaults.

It said the UN staffer, Mikhail Krasnoshchenkov, had been declared persona non grata. The UN mission, UNMIK, said on Thursday the Russian had sustained injuries when he was arrested during a police anti-crime operation in Kosovo and was now in a Belgrade hospital. The expulsion has added further strains to the difficult relationship between Kosovo and Serbia, which used to rule Kosovo. The small state, which has an ethnic Albanian majority and Serb minority, declared independence in 2008. A decade earlier NATO air strikes had wrested control of Kosovo away from Serbia to end a Serb counter-insurgency campaign. On Tuesday, Kosovo police arrested 19 police officers, 11 of whom were Serbs. They were accused of smuggling and other illegal activities in the volatile north of the country. Belgrade, which says the operation was a show of force against Serbs, has put its police and army units on highest alert in response. During a police operation in Kosovo, a Russian national and a local UN colleague, both employed in the United Nations mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) office, had been detained shortly and later released. The Kremlin called the arrest of the Russian national a “flagrant incident”. The Russian foreign ministry said the man was beaten during his arrest by the Kosovo special forces and that he is currently being treated in a Belgrade hospital. “We consider the actions of the Kosovo authorities as the continuation of a blatant policy aimed at the exasperation of inter-ethnic relations in the region (and) contempt for international norms of diplomatic communication,” the ministry said in a statement. Police said the two UN employees had been arrested for standing on a barricade set up by local Serbs to stop police vehicles from passing. “The decision was taken today. This person who works as an international staff for the United Nations … was ordered to leave the territory of the republic of Kosovo,” Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj wrote on his Facebook page. “The decision was taken because of the actions of the Russian national against Kosovo’s constitutional order …” he wrote. The UN mission was set up to run Kosovo following the end of the 1998-99 war but, but it lost executive mandate when Kosovo declared independence in 2008.

Remy Heitz said in a statement the 24-year-old man has admitted making the bomb and depositing the device in front of a bakery. He will be brought before an investigating judge. The suspect, identified only as Mohamed Hichem M., was arrested on Monday. He arrived in France on a tourist visa in August 2017 but failed to leave again. Police did not give his nationality but some French media reported that he was Algerian. He was unknown to police services before the incident. He was handed preliminary charges Friday of attempted murder, criminal terrorist conspiracy and manufacturing, possessing and carrying an explosive device in relation with a terrorist undertaking. French President Emmanuel Macron had called the explosion an “attack” but no group has claimed responsibility for the explosion yet. Last week, Heitz described video surveillance that showed a man heading toward the centre of Lyon on a bike. He was seen arriving on foot, pushing his bike along a pedestrian-only street, then leaving a paper bag on a concrete block in the middle of the street. The suspect immediately returned to his bike and left the same way. One minute later, the explosion shattered the glass of a refrigerator in the bakery. The suspect initially denied his involvement, then admitted “pledging allegiance to the IS deep down inside and dropping off the explosive device he had prepared beforehand,” Heitz said. Data analysis of a computer used by the suspect until the end of last year also helped investigators establish he had an interest for “jihadi thesis and IS’s activities.” The police probe also established that the suspect had ordered online a pack of 20 batteries corresponding to those that served to remotely trigger the device. Some traces found on evidence discovered at the scene also matched the suspect’s genetic profile, Heitz said. The suspect was arrested along with his parents and brother, but they were released on Thursday without charges. France has been hit by a spate of attacks in recent years, some of them deadly, carried out by people ranging from extremist attackers to mentally unstable individuals.

"177"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-iran-in-compliance-with-2015-nuclear-deal-un-atomic-watchdog-says/"|"Kiyoko Metzler"|"The UN atomic watchdog said Friday that Iran continues to stay within the limitations set by the 2015 nuclear deal with major powers, but reported its stockpiles of low-enriched uranium and heavy water are growing and raised questions for the first time about Iran’s adherence to a key but vague provision intended to limit the country’s use of advanced centrifuges. In a confidential quarterly report distributed to member states and seen by The Associated Press, the International Atomic Energy Agency said Iran has stayed within key limitations set in the so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, for uranium and heavy water stockpiles. But while in past reports the IAEA said Iran’s research and development on enrichment “has been conducted using centrifuges within the limits defined in the JCPOA,” the Friday report instead changed the wording to say it “has been conducted using centrifuges specified in the JCPOA.” A centrifuge is a device that enriches uranium by rapidly spinning uranium hexafluoride gas. Under the atomic accord, Iran has been limited to operating 5,060 older-model IR-1 centrifuges. In a footnote, the agency said that “up to 33” more advanced IR-6 centrifuges have been installed and that “technical discussions in relation to the IR-6 centrifuges are ongoing.” Under terms of the nuclear deal, Iran is allowed to test no more than 30 of the IR-6s once the deal has been in place for 8 1/2 years. The deal is murky about limits before that point, which will arrive in 2023. The head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Ali Akbar Salehi, said last month that Iran had begun installing a chain of 20 IR-6 centrifuges at its underground Natanz enrichment facility. Iranian officials say the IR-6 can enrich 10 times faster than an IR-1. Iran maintains that it is allowed to install the centrifuges, regardless of the agreement’s limit on their use for testing. A senior diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t officially allowed to comment on the report said the faster centrifuges were not yet being fed with uranium. The diplomat said the technical discussions on the centrifuges were between the deal’s signatories and Iran, but would not elaborate. “It is being discussed, and we report the facts that we see,” the diplomat said. “The feed line is under agency seal,” the diplomat said, adding it was up to partner countries in the deal to determine whether the installation was a violation of the accord. The nuclear deal is meant to keep Tehran from building atomic weapons in exchange for economic incentives. It has been complicated by the unilateral withdrawal of the United States from the deal last year and Washington’s increased sanctions, which has been taking a toll on the Iranian economy. That has left the other signatories – Germany, Britain, France, Russia and China – struggling to come up with enough incentives to keep Iran in the deal. Earlier this month, Iran announced that if a way couldn’t be found within 60 days to shield it from U.S. sanctions targeting its economy and oil industry, it would ramp up its enrichment of uranium beyond the purity allowed under nuclear deal. And about a week ago, Iran said it had increased its uranium-enrichment production capacity, though only of the lower-enriched uranium permitted by the agreement. In its first quarterly report since those announcements, however, the Vienna-based IAEA found Iran continued to be in compliance and also said its inspectors had been given unfettered access to Iranian nuclear facilities. “Timely and pro-active co-operation by Iran in providing such access facilitates implementation of the additional protocol and enhances confidence,” the report stated, referring to the procedure detailing safeguards and tools for verification. The senior diplomat said Iran does have the capacity to quadruple uranium enrichment as it recently threatened, but that inspectors would have to wait until the next report to determine whether they had actually set that increase in motion. “They have the flexibility, they can increase and they can reduce, and they can do a number of things,” the diplomat said. “The capacity is always there, and we do verify this at a technical level, we are fully monitoring that.” Earlier this month, the U.S. ended deals allowing Iran to exchange its enriched uranium for unrefined yellowcake uranium with Russia, and to sell its heavy water, which is used as a coolant in nuclear reactors, to Oman. That will also make it difficult, if not impossible, for it to stay within stockpile limits if it increases production of both. The IAEA said Iran’s heavy water stockpile was 125.2 metric tons (138 U.S. tons) as of May 26, up from 124.8 tons in February but below the 130 ton limit. Its stock of low-enriched uranium was 174.1 kilograms (383.8 pounds) as of May 20, up from 163.8 kilograms in February; the limit is 202.8 kilograms. It added that Iran had not enriched any uranium above the level allowed by the JCPOA. “All centrifuges and associated infrastructure in storage have remained under continuous agency monitoring,” the IAEA said.

Nils Melzer, the UN special rapporteur on torture who visited Mr. Assange in a high-security London prison on May 9 along with two medical experts, said that he found him agitated, under severe stress and unable to cope with his complex legal case. “Our finding was that Mr. Assange shows all the symptoms of a person who has been exposed to psychological torture for a prolonged period of time. The psychiatrist who accompanied my mission said that his state of health was critical,” Mr. Melzer told Reuters in an interview in Geneva. “But my understanding is that he has now been hospitalized and that he is not able to stand trial,” he said. Mr. Assange was too ill on Thursday to appear via video link from a British prison in a hearing on an extradition request from the United States, his lawyer Gareth Peirce told Reuters. He is in a health ward. “Mr. Assange has been deliberately exposed, for a period of several years, to progressively severe forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, the cumulative effects of which can only be described as psychological torture,” Mr. Melzer said in a statement. The Swiss law professor declined to identify judges or senior politicians whom he accused of defaming Mr. Assange, saying “dozens if not hundreds of individuals” had expressed themselves inappropriately. “Here we are not speaking of prosecution but of persecution. That means that judicial power, institutions and proceedings are being deliberately abused for ulterior motives,” he added. British Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt, in a tweet posted within minutes of Mr. Melzer’s statement, said: “This is wrong. Assange chose to hide in the embassy and was always free to leave and face justice. “The UN Special Rapporteur should allow British courts to make their judgments without his interference or inflammatory accusations,” he said. Mr. Assange made headlines in 2010 when WikiLeaks published a classified U.S. military video showing a 2007 attack by Apache helicopters in Baghdad that killed a dozen people, including two Reuters news staff. Washington is seeking the extradition of Mr. Assange, who was dragged from the Ecuadorean embassy in London on April 11 after his seven-year asylum was revoked, for one of the biggest ever leaks of classified information. The Australian, now 47, had skipped bail and taken refuge there in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden over a sexual assault investigation later dropped. Sweden reopened the investigation in early May. Mr. Assange denies the rape allegation. The United States has charged Mr. Assange with espionage, saying he unlawfully published the names of classified sources and conspired with and assisted ex-Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning in obtaining access to classified information. He faces 18 U.S. criminal counts and decades in prison if convicted. “I am seriously, gravely concerned that if this man were to be extradited to the United States, he would be exposed to a politicized show trial and grave violations of his human rights,” Mr. Melzer said. “The main narrative in this affair really is the United States wanting to make an example of Mr. Assange in order to deter other people from following his example,” he said. Mr. Melzer did not expect U.S. authorities to subject Mr. Assange to physical torture such as waterboarding during interrogations. “I would much more expect him to be subjected to prolonged solitary confinement, to very harsh detention conditions and to a psychological environment which would break him eventually.” "|"UN expert says WikiLeaks’ Assange showed symptoms of ‘psychological torture,’ would face ‘show trial’ in U.S."|"2019-05-31T08:14:22-0400"|"WikiLeaks,Julian Assange,Assange extradition,UN,United States,news,world,Nils Melzer,British Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt,Ecuador embassy,united,assange,sweden,example,mr assange",

Ewold Horn, a wildlife photographer, was shot by his guards from the Abu Sayyaf group when he tried to flee during a clash between government troops and the militants, said Brigadier-General Divino Rey Pabayo, commander of a joint task force on Sulu island. Mr. Horn and a fellow photographer, Lorenzo Vinciguerra from Switzerland, were taken captive as they were sailing off an island called Tawi Tawi on a bird-watching trip more than seven years ago and later taken to Sulu. Mr. Vinciguerra escaped in 2014. Dutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok said the Netherlands had informed Mr. Horn’s family. “I am shocked by this terrible outcome,” Mr. Blok said, “I have been in contact with the family. I will ask my counterpart in the Philippines for further clarification.” Six militants were also killed in the firefight in the town of Patikul on Sulu, Brig.-Gen. Pabayo said. The circumstances of the firefight were not immediately clear. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte condemned Mr. Horn’s killing and sent condolences to his family. “We vow to pursue his killers to the ends of the earth until they are brought to justice,” the President’s spokesman, Salvador Panelo, said in a statement. Also killed during the clash on Friday was Mingayan Sahiron, the wife of Radullan Sahiron, a senior leader of the Abu Sayyaf, the military said. Radullan Sahiron has been on a U.S. State Department wanted list with a US$1-million reward for his capture since his involvement in the kidnapping of U.S. tourists in 2001. He was believed to have escaped the clash, another military spokesman said. The Abu Sayyaf, a small but violent group in the Muslim south of the largely Catholic Philippines, has been known for extortion, kidnappings, beheadings and bombings, and has pledged allegiance to Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.

"180"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-mexicos-president-says-country-will-overcome-trumps-threats-urges/"|"Dave Graham"|"Mexico’s president and the top U.S. business lobbying group called on President Donald Trump to back down from a threat to impose punitive tariffs on Mexican imports, in a dispute over migration that could shock Mexico’s economy. Trump said he will introduce the tariffs on June 10 if Mexico does not halt the flow of illegal immigration, largely from Central America, across the U.S.-Mexican border, battering Mexican financial assets and denting global stocks. The ultimatum from Trump is the biggest foreign policy test to date for Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and a tall order for Mexican security forces struggling not only to combat migrant flows but also to fight a record level of gang violence and homicide. Mexico’s economy, which is heavily reliant on exports to the United States, shrank in the first quarter and would reel under U.S. tariffs which could reach as high as 25 per cent under Trump’s plan. Veteran leftist Lopez Obrador predicted that Trump, who is also engaged in a worsening trade war with China, would ease up on his demand. “I tell all Mexicans to have faith, we will overcome this attitude of the U.S. government, they will make rectifications because the Mexican people don’t deserve to be treated in the way being attempted,” Lopez Obrador told reporters. In April, Trump took a step back from an earlier threat to close the southern border to fight illegal immigration, under pressure from companies worried that a shutdown would cause chaos for businesses. Global equities tumbled and safe-haven sovereign bonds surged Friday after Trump’s unexpected threat added to fears that escalating trade wars will push the United States and other major economies into recession. Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said he would attend talks with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Washington on Wednesday to try to resolve the tariff issue. The influential U.S. Chamber of Commerce is looking at ways to challenge Trump’s tariff move against Mexico, including legal options. “We have no choice but to pursue every option available to push back,” Neil Bradley, the business group’s executive vice president and chief policy officer, told reporters. Other industry groups also criticized Trump’s threat, saying it would cost American businesses, farmers and consumers who have already been bearing the brunt of the lingering U.S. trade dispute with China. The White House deflected the complaints, saying American companies should try to persuade their Mexican partners to lobby their government to co-operate on illegal immigration. “Industry should be in communication with their counterparts in Mexico to encourage the Mexican government to work with the administration and stave off the dangerous crisis at our southern border as quickly as possible,” spokesman Judd Deere said. Underscoring the interconnected nature of the U.S. and Mexican economies, the U.S.-based Beer Institute said most Mexican beer sold in the United States is actually made from U.S.-grown barley and hops. “Whether it be the truck driver, farmer, distributor, local retailer or favourite tavern, every community in America will be affected by this decision,” Jim McGreevy, the institute’s president and CEO, said of the proposed tariffs. In a news conference Friday, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said that U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat to impose tariffs on Mexican imports in a migration dispute does not involve Canada, which will press ahead to ratify the new North American trade deal in tandem with its allies. “Let me just emphasize that this border issue between Mexico and the United States is a bilateral issue, just as the border question or the management of our shared border with the United States is a bilateral issue between Canada and the United States,” Freeland told reporters. “Of course we are partners in a trilateral trade agreement and that is an important North American partnership, but each country also does have bilateral issues,” she said. She did not say, when asked, whether Canada had concerns about the impact on the ratification of the new trade deal. Trump, who has embraced protectionism as part of an “America First” agenda aimed at reshaping global trade, ignited fears in Mexico and on global financial markets on Thursday when he announced he would ratchet up tariffs on Mexico “until the Illegal Immigration problem is remedied.” The plan would impose a 5 per cent tariff on Mexican imports starting on June 10 and increase monthly, up to 25 per cent on Oct. 1. Such levies would deliver a heavy blow to Mexico’s economy, which is underpinned by exports to the United States of goods from avocados and tequila to televisions and cars made by companies such as Ford Motor Co and Nissan. Mexico sends around 80 per cent of its exports to the United States and is one of America’s top trading partners in goods. Mexico’s main stock index was down 1.3 per cent on Friday after opening the session sharply lower, and the peso currency was down more than 2.5 per cent against the dollar. Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard, who was due to travel to Washington on Friday, on Twitter called Trump’s treatment of Mexico “unfair” and said the tariffs made “no economic sense for anyone.” But Trump sought to turn up the pressure again on Friday. “Mexico makes a FORTUNE from the U.S., have for decades, they can easily fix this problem. Time for them to finally do what must be done!” Trump wrote on Twitter. Trump vowed frequently during his 2016 election campaign to make Mexico pay for construction of a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border to curb illegal immigration but successive Mexican governments have firmly rejected that idea. The U.S. Congress also refused a request from Trump for $5.7 billion to help build the wall, prompting him to declare a national emergency and try to divert funds from other areas of the U.S. government. The issue is now in the courts. Trump and his fellow Republicans say something needs to be done to stem the biggest migrant surge on the southern border in a decade. U.S. officials say 80,000 people are being held in custody, with an average of 4,500 mostly Central American migrants arriving daily, overwhelming the ability of Border Patrol officials to handle them. A senior White House official said Trump was particularly concerned that U.S. border agents apprehended a group of 1,036 migrants illegally crossing the border from Mexico on Wednesday. Officials said it was the largest single group since October. Before unveiling the tariff threat, Trump posted a video purporting to be of the crossing on his Twitter feed. Since taking office in December, Mexico’s Lopez Obrador has urged Trump to help him tackle migration by promoting economic development in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, where most of the migrants apprehended on the U.S. border come from. Pledging to exercise “great prudence” in seeking a resolution to the tariff dispute, the Mexican president said he did not want to involve the World Trade Organization for now.

"181"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-brazil-snubs-venezuelan-opposition-envoy-as-doubts-rise-on-juan-guaido/"|"Anthony Boadle"|"Brazil withdrew an invitation to the envoy for Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido to present her diplomatic credentials, she said on Friday, and the government in Brasilia said it would decide later whether to accept them. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro still recognizes Mr. Guaido as the legitimate president of Venezuela, his spokesman said. Mr. Guaido’s envoy, Maria Teresa Belandria, played down the idea that the snub reflected skepticism from Mr. Bolsonaro’s government. Diplomatic analysts said mounting evidence that a change of government in Venezuela is not imminent may have Mr. Bolsonaro and his aides wondering if they overplayed their support for Mr. Guaido. Former military officers making up about a third of Brazil’s cabinet have been wary of provoking Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, warning against moves that could tip an economic and political crisis into violence across Brazil’s northern border. Ms. Belandria had been invited to present her credentials at the presidential palace along with ambassadors from other countries next Tuesday, but the government changed its mind. “I was uninvited,” she told Reuters, but went on to dismiss any suggestion the snub reflected diminished support for Mr. Guaido. “There will be another opportunity,” she said. “Brazil’s support continues to be strong, solid and decisive. It’s merely a protocol matter.” Presidential spokesman General Otavio Rego Barros said Ms. Belandria was the representative of Venezuela’s “legitimate president” and denied an invitation had been withdrawn. “Reception or not of the letters of accreditation will be assessed at a more convenient moment,” he told Reuters. Brazilian newspapers Folha de S.Paulo and O Globo reported that Mr. Bolsonaro’s government had cancelled her invitation because ex-military aides want to pursue dialogue with Mr. Maduro, who also has an official representative in Brasilia. “They realize Brazil has to deal with the reality that Maduro is not going anywhere right now and, even if he leaves, Guaido will not be president and a general will likely take his place,” said Oliver Stuenkel, a professor of foreign relations at the Getulio Vargas Foundation in São Paulo. Mr. Guaido invoked Venezuela’s constitution in January to assume the interim presidency, saying Mr. Maduro’s re-election was not legitimate. Brazil and most Western countries have since backed him as head of state. However, the Brazilian government has not revoked the credentials of Mr. Maduro’s representatives in Brasilia. Mr. Guaido’s press team did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Venezuela recently reopened its border crossing to Brazil after a nearly three-month closure, and Mr. Bolsonaro’s aides are working to restore more regular power supply for the Brazilian state of Roraima, which depends on the Venezuelan grid. Mr. Bolsonaro, like many heads of state in the region, has been sharply critical of the Maduro government, and advisers to U.S. President Donald Trump have pressed him to take a harder line, raising speculation about positioning U.S. troops in Brazil. Mr. Bolsonaro’s top security adviser, retired General Augusto Heleno, told Reuters two weeks ago that Venezuela’s armed forces will decide Mr. Maduro’s future and could depose him to lead a transition to democratic elections. “Recognition of Guaido’s envoy was never agreed to by the military, who vetoed the idea of a U.S. base in Brazil from day one,” said Brazilian diplomat Paulo Roberto de Almeida.

"182"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-town-in-pakistan-struggles-to-cope-with-surge-in-hiv-infections/"|"Syed Raza Hassan"|"Doctors in a town in Pakistan are struggling to cope with a surge in patients infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, with nearly 700 cases since April, most of them children. Health officials suspect the outbreak is linked to reused syringes and needles and improperly screened blood transfusions. “For me it was impossible to imagine,” said Nazeer said, recalling the day a doctor said his 16-month-old girl had tested positive for HIV. “I told him ‘are you joking with me, how can she have HIV?’,” he said in his home in Ratodero, 480 km (298 miles) from Karachi, the capital of the southern province of Sindh. His daughter is receiving treatment, he said, adding he did not know how she was infected. Health officials say 681 people have tested positive for HIV in Ratodero, of whom 537 are children, since April 25. More than 21,00 people have taken an HIV test at Ratodero’s only screening centre in a government hospital. Others have been tested at private clinics. “I have identified the tip of the iceberg. This could be in the thousands, not hundreds,” said Imran Akbar Arbani, who operates a clinic in the town in Lakarna district. About 60 per cent of Ratodero patients were infected by reused needles and syringes, or through transfusions of blood that were not screened properly for HIV, said Sikander Memon, head of the AIDS control program in the province. Police and doctors conducted an initial investigation and found that 123 HIV patients had been treated by one doctor before they were infected. Muzaffar Ghanghro was arrested on April 30 and has been charged with unintentional murder, police said. “Negligence and carelessness of Dr. Muzaffar Ghanghro has been the prime reason behind the spread of HIV at the later stage,” the investigation team said in a report. Reuters was not permitted to contact Dr. Ghangro in jail and was not able to contact his lawyer. Imtiaz, a labourer, said he had taken his three children to Dr. Ghangro because there was no pediatrician in town. All three became infected with HIV. “He applied the same drip on 50 children without changing the needle,” he said. Pakistan has some 163,000 HIV and AIDS patients, of whom only 25,000 are registered with provincial and federal AIDS control programs, said Zafar Mirza, a health adviser to Prime Minister Imran Khan. At Pakistan’s request, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have sent a team of experts to the area. They are expected to visit Ratodero on Friday. “They will carry out a proper investigation into how this outbreak too place,” Mirza told reporters. “I hope in the coming few weeks we will know the reasons.” The government has ordered 50,000 HIV screening kits and is setting up three treatment centres. Adult patients are receiving antiretroviral drugs and medicines have been ordered for children, Mirza said. The Ratodero cases underscore the dire state of health care in Pakistan, a country of 208 million where almost a third of the population lives on less than $3.20 a day and where many people cannot afford expensive medical tests or drugs. Few families can afford proper treatment for HIV, which usually involves regular trips to Karachi. “I have sold all my valuables for treatment. Now I can’t afford to go Karachi for my children’s medicines every month,” said Tariq, who lives in a village near Ratodero. Tariq, his wife and daughter are HIV positive, and a nephew tested positive this month. He does not know how they became infected. “There are 16 HIV cases in our village alone. No one has come to see our plight,” he said.

"183"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-saudi-king-blasts-irans-terrorist-acts-at-islamic-summit/"|"Aya Batrawy"|"Saudi Arabia’s King Salman slammed Iran over recent attacks targeting the kingdom, describing the incidents on Saturday in a speech before Muslim leaders gathered in Mecca as “terrorist acts” that threaten global energy supplies. It was the monarch’s strongest words yet since tensions spiked in recent weeks between the two regional heavyweights. Iran had a representative present at the 57-nation summit of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, or OIC, but its top leadership did not attend. The Islamic summit drew political figures and heads of state from countries spanning Africa, the Middle East and Asia. They come with widely varying policies and priorities, but share a common reverence for the Al-Aqsa mosque in East Jerusalem, known as the first “Qibla” because Muslims prayed toward it before the cube-shaped Kaaba in Mecca. Despite sharp differences between OIC member-states on a gamut of issues, a final statement by the group stressed support for a future Palestinian state, as well as the rejection of any deal or plan that prolongs Israeli occupation and undermines the right of return for Palestinian refugees. The language stood in contradiction to the Trump administration’s decision to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in recognition of it as Israel’s capital, as well as a still undisclosed White House plan already rejected by the Palestinian leadership. Glimpses of the plan suggest it sidelines or ignores the long-standing goal of Palestinian independence. A meeting next month in Bahrain aimed at rallying Arab economic support for the plan is being boycotted by the Palestinian Authority, but Saudi Arabia and the UAE are attending amid growing ties with Israel in the face of shared enemy Iran. The U.S. recently sent an aircraft carrier and B-52 bombers to the Persian Gulf as tensions run high. The escalation stems from the Trump administration’s decision to withdraw the U.S. from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers last year and impose crippling economic sanctions on the country. Speaking to leaders from OIC countries, King Salman opened the summit saying the world must fight the sources and funding of terrorism around the world. He then said the alleged sabotage of four oil tankers off the coast of the United Arab Emirates in past weeks represents a “grave danger” to the security of maritime traffic and regional security. He blamed Iranian-backed terrorist militias of being behind a subsequent drone attack on a Saudi oil pipeline. “We emphasize that these subversive terrorist acts are aimed not only at the kingdom and the Gulf region, but also on the security of navigation and energy supplies to the world,” King Salman said. Iran denies being involved in the incidents. Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani had his own message for OIC leaders ahead of the summit, urging them to stay focused on the rights of Palestinians. In a letter published online Friday, Rouhani said Muslim leaders should not let the importance of Palestinian statehood be “marginalized” in the face of the Trump administration’s forthcoming Israeli-Palestinian plan. Rouhani also noted in the letter he was not invited to the Islamic summit, but expressed Iran’s readiness to work with all Muslim leaders to confront the White House’s so-called “Deal of the Century.” King Salman told OIC leaders that the rights of Palestinians remains the cornerstone issue of the organization, which was formed 50 years ago in response to an extremist arson attack on the Al-Aqsa Mosque in East Jerusalem, one of Islam’s most sacred sites. He said the mosque remains under occupation and threat. “We reiterate with emphasis the rejection of any measures that infringe upon the legal status of Al-Quds Al-Sharif,” King Salman said, referring to East Jerusalem and the mosque compound. Turkey’s Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said any peace deal that does not include an independent and sovereign Palestinian state along 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital will be rejected by the OIC body. “We shall not accept the rewriting of history, exchanging justice with economic benefits and disregarding dignity and legitimacy,” he told the OIC summit. The meeting began after midnight and ran into the early hours Saturday due to evening prayers and daylong fasting during the holy month of Ramadan. Saudi Arabia’s effort to bring leaders to Mecca reflects the kingdom’s desire to project a unified Muslim and Arab position on Iran to isolate it internationally. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said Tehran regrets “Saudi Arabia’s abuse of its privilege as the host” of the OIC “to sow division between Islamic and regional countries.” The summit follows two emergency Arab meetings the night before in Mecca criticizing Iran’s behaviour and influence in countries like Syria, Iraq and Lebanon. Presenting a unified stance on Iran faces obstacles within OIC member-states, which includes Iran. Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan, who is attending the summit, has sought good ties with both Saudi Arabia and Iran, for example. The leader of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah group told supporters in Lebanon on Friday the Mecca summits are a Saudi call for help from Arab countries after Saudi Arabia failed to win in Yemen, where the kingdom and its allies have been at war since 2015 against Iranian-allied Yemeni rebels. “It is a sign of failure,” Hassan Nasrallah said. “These summits are calls for help … that express the failure and the inabilities in confronting the Yemeni army, popular resistance and people.” "|"Saudi king blasts Iran’s ‘terrorist acts’ at Islamic summit"|"2019-05-31T20:48:00-0400"|"International,Saudi Arabia’s King Salman,Organization of Islamic Cooperation,Mecca,Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani,iran,summit,plan,world,mecca,security,kingdom,Iran,Kaaba,OIC",

Four other people were wounded in Friday’s shooting, including a police officer whose bulletproof vest saved his life, said Virginia Beach Police Chief James Cervera. The city’s visibly shaken mayor, Bobby Dyer, called it “the most devastating day in the history of Virginia Beach.” The shooting happened shortly after 4 p.m. when the veteran employee of the Public Utilities Department entered a building in the city’s Municipal Center, and “immediately began to indiscriminately fire upon all of the victims,” Cervera said. Authorities did not release the suspect’s name, instead choosing to focus on the victims during a news conference. Police entered the building and got out as many employees as they could, then exchanged fire with the suspect, who was armed with a .45-calibre handgun, the chief said. “It was a long gunbattle between those four officers and the suspect,” he said. He said officers gave the suspect first aid after he was shot, but he died. Police initially said the gunman shot and killed 11 people, including one who was found inside a vehicle outside the municipal building. Cervera later said one more died on the way to the hospital. The shooting sent shock waves through Virginia Beach, the state’s largest city and a popular vacation spot in southeastern Virginia. The building where the attack took place is in a suburban complex miles away from the high-rise hotels along the beach and the downtown business area. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam said in a statement he was devastated by the “unspeakable, senseless violence,” and is offering the state’s full support to survivors and relatives of the victims. “That they should be taken in this manner is the worst kind of tragedy,” the governor said during the news conference. The White House said President Donald Trump had been briefed and was monitoring the situation. Megan Banton, an administrative assistant who works in the building where the shooting happened, said she heard gunshots, called 911 and barricaded herself and about 20 colleagues inside an office, pushing a desk against a door. “We tried to do everything we could to keep everybody safe,” she said. “We were all just terrified. It felt like it wasn’t real, like we were in a dream. You are just terrified because all you can hear is the gunshots.” She texted her mom, telling her that there was an active shooter in the building and she and others were waiting for police. “Thank God my baby is OK,” Banton’s mother, Dana Showers, said. At a nearby middle school, friends and relatives were reuniting with loved ones who were in the building when the shooting happened. They included Paul Swain, 50, who said he saw his fiancee from across the parking lot, clearly in an agitated state. “I think she knew some of the people,” he said. Outside the school, Cheryl Benn, 65, waited while her husband, David, a traffic engineer with the city who was in the building where the shooting happened, gave a written statement to detectives. She said her husband initially called her from a barricaded room and said it sounded as if someone had been working with a nail gun. Then he saw the bodies. “This is unbelievable for Virginia Beach,” Cheryl Benn said. “By and large, it’s a pretty calm and peaceful place to live.” "|"At least 12 people killed in Virginia Beach mass shooting; suspect dead"|"2019-05-31T18:30:42-0400"|"shooting,guns,virginia shooting,U.S. shooting,violence,crime,virginia beach,U.S.,world news,building,suspect,people,city,police,virginia",

Williams failed to recover from a woeful start against fellow American Sofia Kenin as the 20-year-old motored into the last 16 with a 6-2 7-5 win, putting the former world number one’s quest for a record-equalling 24th singles major on hold. Williams, who suffered her earliest Grand Slam exit since Wimbledon 2014, was given a standing ovation as she walked off Court Philippe Chatrier while sections of the crowd jeered her conqueror. The 37-year-old Williams, seeded 10th, paid the price for her lack of match practice as she was playing in only her fifth tournament of the year, and her fightback in the middle of the second set was short-lived. Osaka, just like Williams, was a possible semi-final opponent for third seed Halep, who is looking to become the first woman to retain the Suzanne Lenglen Cup since Justine Henin won a third consecutive title in 2007. But the Japanese top seed, who had already been forced to go the distance in her first two rounds, was clueless in a 6-4 6-2 defeat to Czech Katerina Siniakova. The loss snapped Osaka’s 16-match winning streak in Grand Slams after she won the 2018 U.S. Open and this year’s Australian Open. With Osaka gone, five of the top six seeds are now out of the women’s singles draw, leaving Halep as the sole survivor. The Romanian showed her best side in a 6-2 6-1 dismissal of Ukrainian 27th seed Lesia Tsurenko. In the men’s draw, world number one Novak Djokovic strolled into the fourth round with a 6-3 6-3 6-2 victory against Italian qualifier Salvatore Caruso. Leading the charge of the young generation, Alexander Zverev continued to flirt with danger, the German fifth seed advancing with a 6-4 6-2 4-6 1-6 6-2 victory over Serbian Dusan Lajovic — his second five-setter of the tournament. The 22-year-old, who has now won all five-set matches he has played at Roland Garros, next faces Monte Carlo Masters winner Fabio Fognini after the Italian ninth seed dismissed Spain’s Roberto Bautista Agut 7-6(5) 6-4 4-6 6-1. Greek Stefanos Tsitsipas and Austrian Dominic Thiem both progressed with four-set victories. Last year’s runner-up Thiem will take on Gael Monfils, one of two Frenchmen left in the draw. Tsitsipas will be up against a resurgent Stan Wawrinka after the 2015 champion downed Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov in three tiebreaks.

"186"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-in-1989-china-extinguished-tiananmens-protests-but-lit-the-spark/"|"Nathan VanderKlippe"|"When Qi Zhiyong thinks back on the night violence descended on Tiananmen Square 30 years ago, his mind brings him back to the bloody unravelling. The moment the lights were turned off. The sight of tanks and armoured cars circling. The sound of loudspeakers warning students to leave. The warning from the man who cried, “they’re killing people!” The crippling sensation of bullets piercing his own skin. Mr. Qi’s body still bears the mark of that day. Both of his legs were amputated as a result of injuries sustained on June 4, 1989. Less visible is the change the shooting brought to his soul. “I was raised to believe in our government, but the government shot me in my legs,” he says. After June 4, “a lot of people lost confidence in the education, policy and ideology of the Communist Party. People no longer had any beliefs. “As a result, they rushed to church.” In the months and years that followed the Tiananmen violence, people across China sought solace and guidance in churches and temples, propelling a trend of religious adherence that has altered the social fabric of a country whose leadership remains officially atheist. Chinese authorities have for 30 years mounted an intense effort to eradicate the memory of the Tiananmen crackdown, purging it from the country’s internet and maintaining an authoritarian vigilance of students, workers and activists to ensure protests never again sweep the country. But the spark of spiritual interest that spread following 1989 has been one of the more lasting legacies of the student uprising, religious historians argue, a change that has altered the country despite the government’s ambition to condemn Tiananmen to the forgotten past. Western scholars estimate the total number of Christians in China today at roughly 70 million – some 23 times the official number of Christians in 1982. A surprising number of modern China’s most outspoken critics – human-rights defenders who carry on some of the students’ calls for change in the country – are Christian. Tiananmen was not alone in driving people to Chinese places of worship. Religious experts say other moments of tumult and dislocation had a similar effect, including, over recent decades, China’s conversion to a competitive market economy with its attendant subversion of state social welfare guarantees. ”But in the aftermath of the Tiananmen massacre, groups of mainland Chinese went to church,” says Fenggang Yang, a scholar at Purdue University who is a foremost researcher of the spiritual development of China. He travelled through China in the 1980s and the 1990s, and the change between those two decades was profound, he says. Churches that were once half-empty and attended by the elderly in the 1980s grew so full with young people in the 1990s that they ran out of space. He recalls people gathered outside the front steps for Sunday services, unable to find room inside. In Beijing, churches moved from a single Sunday service to “three and even four” services in the 1990s, and then eventually five in a day, says Xu Yonghai, a pastor who leads a small weekly service in his modest apartment in the capital city. “There were so many people that they had to find ways to accommodate those people.” He himself first went to church in 1989. At least four of the 21 student leaders declared “most wanted” for their roles in 1989 became Christians, according to Prof. Yang. June 4 became “a turning point, in that our previous belief system was more or less based on patriotism and worship of ancestors,” says Zhou Fengsuo, who was number five on the list. “The massacre at Tiananmen, I think, destroyed that connection for a lot of us. This was the moment we began to search in our hearts – is there a God? Is there truth? What can we do? Many influential Christian leaders in the house church movement today were converted after 1989.” (House churches in China operate outside officially sanctioned religious structures.) Christianity held other attractions for students who had sought democratic reforms in China. Some saw Christian ethics as inseparable from Western political values. At Peking University in the 1990s, Yu Jie didn’t attend church, but did begin to read through the Bible. “Most of our discussions at that time focused on the civilization aspects, for example, the connection between the democratic system and Christianity,” he says. A prominent dissident author and critic, he became a Christian in 2003. The Tiananmen protests themselves were religiously agnostic, motivated by philosophical ambition and demands for societal fairness, in keeping with the character of a country that worshipped Mao over divinity. Historian Timothy Brook’s Quelling the People, one of the most definitive histories of the movement, makes no reference to church – or even to God – although it clearly describes how 1989 formed a division point in China’s modern history. “The Beijing Massacre was the last straw breaking the thin bridge of trust that, until June 4, still stretched between the government and its people. It has changed everything,” wrote Prof. Brook, who is the Republic of China Chair at the University of British Columbia. “Many people, including those still living in mainland China, have gradually realized that the problem of China is not caused by one or two people,” says Yu Houqiang, who was a student leader in 1989. “It’s the absence of belief.” In the wake of the protests, Mr. Yu, who now lives in Toronto, adopted a pantheistic spirituality, calling himself both Christian and Buddhist. Soon after Tiananmen, other factors also emerged to draw people to Christianity. Pastor Xu, for example, recalls rural women in the 1990s seeking religious community as an escape from isolation in traditional marriages. The Chinese state, as well, has encouraged some forms of spiritual observance, particularly of Daoist practice, with its use of meditation and nutrition to enhance personal wellbeing. At the same time, authorities across China have overseen a sweeping process of “Sinicization” of religion, which has included tearing down crosses, breaking up house churches, removing domes from mosques and, in the western Xinjiang region, instilling fear that praying or possessing a Koran could be grounds for internment. Even in Beijing, “for me, going to church has become a luxury. A lot of churches are gone,” says Mr. Qi, the man who lost both legs after the Tiananmen violence. He speaks from the back of a police car, as authorities attempt to constrain the movements and conversations of people ahead of the 30th anniversary. Yet the country’s Christians continue to grow in number, Western scholars believe. Among the faithful are a small group that can be counted as some of the most direct successors of the student protesters of 30 years ago – human-rights advocates still willing to publicly critique Chinese society and exercise of power. Christian observance is surprisingly prominent among Chinese human-rights lawyers, many of whom have become prominent figures because of a sweeping crackdown that has seen some jailed and tortured in recent years. Roughly 15 per cent of the 300 people caught up in a 2015 crackdown on the legal profession are Christian. Five of nine people subsequently sentenced to jail were Christian, according to a human-rights lawyer who spoke on condition of anonymity, because the Chinese government has barred the person from speaking with foreign media. Some were drawn to the profession by Tiananmen. “After June 4, a group of human rights lawyers suddenly appeared, and they accepted cases of ordinary people,” says Liu Fenggang, a church activist who spent three years in a Chinese prison for his advocacy. He now lives in Fort St. John, B.C. “These lawyers choose to believe in God out of a sense of justice,” says Mr. Liu, who remembers walking in downtown Beijing, seeing tanks, soldiers and bloodied people – and smelling gunpowder. He was baptized Nov. 19, 1989. ”What the government did in that year disappointed a lot of Chinese people,” he says. “And this provided Christianity enough space to develop.” "|"In 1989, China extinguished Tiananmen’s protests – but lit the spark for a religious revival"|"2019-06-02T09:58:29-0400"|"tiananmen square,tiananmen massacre,tiananmen anniversary,china christianity,christianity asia,religion china,state religion china,china,world news,Tiananmen,people,number,church,country,government", 
"187"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-dwyane-wade-honours-graduates-at-florida-high-school-where-mass/"|""|"Retired NBA star Dwyane Wade was a surprise guest speaker Sunday at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School’s graduation ceremony, leading cheers and recalling how nervous he was to meet students following the on-campus shootings last year that claimed 17 lives. It comes two days after another mass shooting, this time in Virginia Beach. Wade called himself “part of this MSD family” and told graduates that it was understandable if they feel unsure about their futures – because in some ways, after 16 years in the NBA, he also is unsure exactly what his future entails. “I’m so proud to say the words ‘MSD Strong,’” Wade said. “Today, you will close a chapter in your lives and embark on new experiences and journeys and memories. And it’s a time to celebrate and be proud of everything you’ve done to make it to this moment. As you know, I, too, recently closed a pretty significant chapter in my life. So in a way I feel like I can relate to what’s going on in your minds right now.” Wade’s appearance was not publicly disclosed before it happened. The same thing happened when he visited the school the day it reopened following the shootings on Feb. 14, 2018. He relayed the story of what went into that visit, and how he was unsure if his remarks would have any real impact on a grieving student body. “What started going through my mind was, ‘How do I dare come here and act like I know what you guys have been going through? How narcissistic of me to think I can come here and make a difference because I’m good at my sport?’” Wade said. “I remember walking slowly to the cafeteria. As I was walking in, students started seeing me, started seeing smiles, people running, pulling out their phones. “And I remember thinking, ‘Wow,’” Wade said. Wade has spoken of that day often and has remained an advocate of improved school safety. One of the shooting victims, Joaquin Oliver, was a huge fan of the three-time NBA champion and was buried in a Wade jersey. Wade closed his remarks by asking those in attendance to join him in a cheer that he used to spur on the Miami Heat in the 2013 NBA Finals, something he borrowed from one of his favourite films, “Red Tails,” which tells the story of the Tuskegee Airmen during World War II. He would lead the Heat in the cheer, punctuated by the words “to the last man, to the last minute, to the last second, we fight! We fight! We fight!” And once he led the graduates and their guests in the cheer Sunday, he wrapped up his speech by again saying “MSD Strong” — the school’s mantra since the tragedy.

He was 92. His death was confirmed on Thursday by Riccardo Pavoncelli, his son-in-law. Mr. von Bulow was charged with the attempted murder of his wife, Martha von Bulow, known as Sunny, by injecting her with insulin to aggravate her hypoglycemia, a low-blood-sugar condition. Martha von Bulow, the heiress to a US$75-million utilities fortune, went into a coma in December 1979, from which she recovered, and a second, irreversible coma in December 1980. She remained in a vegetative state until her death in 2008. A jury in Newport, Rhode Island, found Mr. von Bulow guilty of attempting to induce his wife’s death, and he was sentenced in 1982 to a 30-year prison term. He continued to maintain his innocence and was freed on US$1-million bail. An appeal, masterminded by Harvard law professor Alan M. Dershowitz, was successful and paved the way for a new trial. Mr. von Bulow was represented at his second trial, in Providence, Rhode Island, by Thomas Puccio, a former U.S. attorney, and acquitted of all charges in 1985. In his best-selling book “Reversal of Fortune” (1986), Mr. Dershowitz recounted his role in aiding Mr. von Bulow. He began the book with a quote from a prosecutor involved: “This case has everything. It has money, sex, drugs; it has Newport, New York and Europe; it has nobility; it has maids, butlers, a gardener.” Indeed, the von Bulow case became one of the most publicized legal contests in the second half of the 20th century. Television offered gavel-to-gavel coverage of the trials. And Mr. Dershowitz’s book became the basis for a popular 1990 film of the same name, directed by Barbet Schroeder, which starred Jeremy Irons, in an Oscar-winning performance, as Mr. von Bulow, Glenn Close as his wife and Ron Silver as Mr. Dershowitz. Mr. von Bulow was born Claus Cecil Borberg in Copenhagen, Denmark, on Aug. 11, 1926, the son of Jonna and Svend Borberg. His parents divorced when he was 4. His father, a theatre critic, was an admirer of the Third Reich, and when World War II ended, he was arrested in Denmark as a Nazi collaborator. He was sentenced to four years in prison, was released on appeal after he had served 18 months, and died a year later. During the early years of the war, young Claus was spirited out of Denmark by way of Sweden and sent to Britain to live with his mother, who had taken up residence there. He adopted the name of his maternal grandfather, Frits Bulow, a former Danish minister of justice. The “von,” usually used only by members of noble families, was added later. Mr. von Bulow told Mr. Dershowitz that his wife was the one who had insisted he add it. Mr. von Bulow entered Cambridge University when he was 16 and graduated in 1946 with a law degree. He then spent a year in Paris attending classes at the École des Sciences Politiques. On his return to London, he worked in banking before joining the law offices of Quintin Hogg, a noted British barrister who later became Lord Hailsham. During this time, Mr. von Bulow, a charming and handsome man with a military bearing, became a highly visible social figure in London while living with his mother in a fashionable apartment in Belgrave Square. In the early 1960s, he was hired as an administrative assistant by the oil tycoon J. Paul Getty, who had moved his business to London. Mr. von Bulow remained with Mr. Getty, one of the world’s richest men, until his marriage. The US$1-million bail he posted pending his appeal was thought to have come from a Getty family member. Mr. von Bulow married Martha Crawford von Auersperg in 1966. Her father, George Crawford, was the founder of the Columbia Gas and Electric Co. Her annual income at the time was said to be in the neighbourhood of US$3.5-million. Little more than a year earlier, she had divorced Prince Alfred von Auersperg of Austria, her first husband. The couple settled in a palatial Manhattan apartment. Mr. von Bulow stopped working, and Martha von Bulow began looking for oceanfront property in Newport, where her mother, Annie Laurie Crawford Aitken, and stepfather, Russell Aitken, had an estate. She bought Clarendon Court, a Georgian mansion set on 10 acres overlooking the sea, which had been used as the house of the character played by Grace Kelly in the 1956 film “High Society.” It was there that Ms. von Bulow was found in a coma on both occasions. Mr. von Bulow was prosecuted as a result of an investigation initiated by the children of Ms. von Bulow’s first marriage, Prince Alexander von Auersperg and Princess Annie Laurie von Auersperg Kneissl, known as Ala. The accusations pitted the siblings against their stepfather and their half sister, Cosima von Bulow Pavoncelli, the daughter of Claus and Martha von Bülow, who was born in 1967. A principal prosecution witness against Mr. von Bulow was Maria Schrallhammer, Martha von Bulow’s maid. She testified that shortly before Christmas 1979 she had heard Ms. von Bulow moaning behind a locked door, and that Mr. von Bulow refused to call a doctor as his wife sank into a coma. Mr. von Bulow said he had thought his wife was sleeping. When Ms. von Bulow was later admitted to Newport Hospital, tests indicated a high level of insulin in her system. Almost a year later, on Dec. 21, 1980, Ms. von Bulow was again found unconscious and taken to the hospital in a coma. The two von Auersperg children consulted Richard Kuh, a former Manhattan district attorney, and hired him to investigate the circumstances of both incidents. A maid later testified that she had found a small black bag containing syringes, yellow paste and white powder in a closet in Claus von Bulow’s study. She said she passed these on to Ms. Kneissl, who had the contents analyzed. It was determined that the paste was a form of Valium and the powder was Seconal. Ms. Schrallhammer also said that she later found insulin in the bag. After his acquittal, Mr. von Bulow’s stepdaughter said that despite the verdict, “we know and he knows that he tried to murder our mother.” Mr. von Bulow said his stepchildren were “misguided” but added, “I have no feeling of vindictiveness.” The stepchildren then filed a US$56-million civil suit against him. It was settled in 1987 with the stipulation that Mr. von Bulow agree to a divorce and that he not discuss the case publicly. Also settled at the same time was a suit instituted by Cosima von Bulow Pavoncelli, who supported her father through his trials and who claimed that family members had exerted undue influence in turning her grandmother against her. Martha von Bulow’s mother, Annie Aitken, had died in 1984, and her will denied Ms. von Bulow Pavoncelli any share of her US$100-million estate. In the settlement, Mr. von Bulow renounced all claims to his wife’s fortune in return for his daughter’s receiving an equal share of Ms. Aitken’s estate with her half sister and half brother. In addition to his daughter, Mr. von Bulow is survived by three grandchildren.

"189"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-pompeo-says-us-ready-to-talk-to-iran-with-no-preconditions/"|"Matthew Lee"|"U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday that the Trump administration is ready for unconditional discussions with Iran in an effort to ease rising tensions that have sparked fears of conflict. But the United States will not relent in trying to pressure the Islamic Republic to change its behaviour in the Middle East, the United States’ top diplomat said. Mr. Pompeo repeated long-standing U.S. accusations that Iran is bent on destabilizing the region, but he also held out the possibility of talks as President Donald Trump suggested last week. Mr. Trump had first raised the idea of talks “without preconditions” in July, 2018, although that was well before tensions had reached their current point. In the 11 months since then, the United States has imposed crippling sanctions on Iran, first in November and then again last month, targeting the most lucrative sectors of its economy. The action has drawn Iran’s ire and strong words of threatened retaliation. Iran’s President, Hassan Rouhani, said the United States must return to the historic 2015 nuclear deal, which Mr. Trump withdrew from in May, 2018. He was quoted by Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency as saying that if the U.S. “realizes that the way it chose was incorrect, then we can sit at the negotiating table and solve any problem.” Otherwise, he said, Iran has no choice but resistance. While the latest offer may not pan out, Mr. Pompeo made it during a visit to Switzerland, the country that long has represented U.S. interests in Iran, as part of a European trip aimed at assuring wary leaders that the United States is not eager for war . “We’re prepared to engage in a conversation with no preconditions,” Mr. Pompeo told reporters at a news conference with his Swiss counterpart. “We’re ready to sit down with them, but the American effort to fundamentally reverse the malign activity of this Islamic Republic, this revolutionary force, is going to continue.” Iran’s Foreign Minister dismissed Mr. Trump’s invitation for Iranian officials to contact him about possible talks. “It’s not very likely because talking is the continuation of the process of pressure. He is imposing pressure. This may work in a real estate market. It does not work in dealing with Iran,” Javad Zarif told ABC’s This Week. Separate from Mr. Pompeo’s remarks about Iran, the Washington Post reported Sunday that the U.S. Secretary of State recently told a private gathering of Jewish leaders in New York that the administration’s long-awaited Mideast peace plan might be argued to be “unexecutable” and might not “gain traction.” Citing an audio recording of the remarks delivered Tuesday, the Post reported that Mr. Pompeo expressed his hope that the peace deal isn’t simply dismissed out of hand. The plan that Mr. Trump has called “the deal of the century” has been delayed several times, as Mr. Pompeo noted to the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. Downplaying expectations for finding the key to an agreement ending the conflict, he told the group there are “no guarantees that we’re the ones that unlock it.” In Switzerland, Mr. Pompeo’s meeting with Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis in the southern Swiss town of Bellinzona came amid concerns about the potential for escalation and miscalculation with Iran — a situation that has many in Europe and the Middle East on edge. Mr. Cassis, whose country has been an intermediary between the two before, made no secret of that nervousness. “The situation is very tense. We are fully aware, both parties are fully aware, of this tension. Switzerland, of course, wishes there is no escalation, no escalation to violence,” he said. “Both parties are now increasing the pressure, and for the rest this is a matter of worry, but we cannot do anything unless we get a mandate from both parties.” Mr. Cassis said Switzerland would be pleased to serve as an intermediary, but not a “mediator,” between the United States and Iran. To do so, however, would require requests from both sides, he said. Neither he nor Mr. Pompeo would say if such requests had been made of the Swiss. Mr. Pompeo thanked Switzerland, which serves as the “protecting power” for the United States in Iran, for looking after U.S. citizens and residents detained there. Trump administration officials have suggested they would look positively at any move to release at least five U.S. citizens and at least two permanent U.S. residents currently imprisoned in Iran. Mr. Pompeo declined to comment on whether he had made a specific request to the Swiss about the detainees. But, he said the release of unjustly jailed U.S. nationals in Iran and elsewhere is a U.S. priority. Mr. Pompeo was in Switzerland on the second leg after Germany of a four-nation tour of Europe in which he is both trying to calm nerves and stressing that the United States will defend itself and not relent in raising pressure on Iran with economic sanctions. Despite the firm stance, Mr. Trump has signalled a willingness to talk with Iran’s leadership. Iranian officials have hinted at the possibility but also insisted they will not be bulled. “If they want to talk, I’m available,” Mr. Trump said last week, even as Mr. Pompeo and the White House national security adviser, John Bolton, were stepping up warnings that any attack on U.S. interests by Iran or its proxies would draw a rapid and significant U.S. response. The United States is sending hundreds of additional troops to the region after blaming Iran and Iranian proxies for recent sabotage to tankers in the Persian Gulf and drone attacks on Saudi Arabia’s oil infrastructure. Some analysts believe Iran is acting to restore leverage it has lost since Mr. Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal and the U.S. reimposed sanctions that have hobbled Iran’s economy. Last month, the administration ended sanctions waivers that had allowed certain countries to continue to import Iranian oil, the country’s main source of revenue, without U.S. penalties. The U.S. also designated Iran’s Revolutionary Guards a “foreign terrorist organization,” adding new layers of sanctions to foreigners that might do business with it or its affiliates. Despite the U.S. withdrawal, Iran has remained a party to the nuclear deal that involves the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, Germany and the European Union. Iran has continued to broadly comply with the terms, which called for it to curb its nuclear work in exchange for sanctions relief. On Friday, however, the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog reported that Iran may be in violation of limits on the number of advanced centrifuges it can use. Mr. Pompeo declined to comment on the findings of the International Atomic Energy Agency other than to say the United States is “watching closely” what is going on in Iran. “The world should be mindful of how we are watching closely how Iran is complying with the requirements that were set out,” he said.

The Pope made the comment during a meeting with Roma people at the last event of his three day trip to Romania, saying his heart was made “heavy” by the meeting. “It is weighed down by the many experiences of discrimination, segregation and mistreatment experienced by your communities. History tells us that Christians, too, including Catholics, are not strangers to such evil,” he said. With an estimated population of 10-12 million, approximately six million of whom live in the European Union, Roma people are the biggest ethnic minority in Europe and rights groups say they are often the victims of prejudice and social exclusion. Mr. Salvini, who has clashed with the pope repeatedly on migration issues, reacted angrily last month when Pope Francis received a group of Roma at the Vatican last month. Mr. Salvini, head of the far-right Lega party and a deputy prime minister, responded by repeating his promise to close all Roma camps in Italy. “I would like to ask your forgiveness for this,” the Pope told the Roma. “I ask forgiveness – in the name of the Church and of the Lord – and I ask forgiveness of you. For all those times in history when we have discriminated, mistreated or looked askance at you ...” A Roma youth, Razaila Vasile Dorin, told reporters: “It’s an honour that a person like the pope comes to our community. We are proud.” “It’s important that the pope is asking forgiveness. There is racism in every country. When we go out everyone looks at us and we don’t like that. I am proud to be a gypsy.” Earlier on Sunday, the Pope said a mass for about 100,000 people during which he beatified seven Communist-era bishops of the Eastern Rite Catholic Church who died in prison or as a result of their harsh treatment during Romania’s communist era. “[The bishops] endured suffering and gave their lives to oppose an illiberal ideological system that oppressed the fundamental rights of the human person,” Pope Francis said. After the Second World War, Romania’s Communist authorities confiscated properties of the Eastern Rite Catholic Church and ordered its members to join the majority Orthodox Church, which was easier for the party to control. Historians say about half a million Romanians including politicians, priests, doctors, officers, landowners and merchants were sentenced and jailed in the 1950s and early sixties, and a fifth of them perished in prisons and labour camps. Many Catholic properties taken by the Communist dictatorship or given by the government to the Orthodox have yet to be returned 30 years after the fall of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.

"191"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-virginia-beach-gunman-notified-boss-of-resignation-hours-before/"|"Ben Finley Michael Kunzelman"|"The gunman who attacked his colleagues at a Virginia Beach government office building resigned by e-mail hours before the shooting, a city official said Sunday as authorities sought a motive in the assault that killed 12 people. Officials gave no indication why 40-year-old DeWayne Craddock had notified a superior of his intention to leave his job as a civil engineer in the utilities department. He was an employee “in good standing” and showed “satisfactory” job performance, City Manager Dave Hansen said. Police Chief James Cervera described a chaotic scene as officers entered the building and pursued the assailant through a tightly packed warren of offices that the Chief likened to a maze or a honeycomb. They exchanged fire in a protracted gun battle. Chief Cervera did not know how many rounds were fired but said it was “well into the double digits.” “In the police world, anything more than three to five shots is a long gun battle,” he said. At one point, the suspect fired at officers through a door and a wall and hit one officer, who was saved by a bulletproof vest. Then the firing stopped, and police realized the gunman was holed up in an office. When they got into the office, they took the wounded shooter into custody and gave him first aid, Chief Cervera said. He was taken from the scene by ambulance 36 minutes after officers arrived and he died at a hospital. A medical examiner will determine whether he was killed by an officer’s bullet or his own, the Chief said. There was no indication he targeted anyone specifically. Mr. Cervera said investigators are retracing the gunman’s activities on the day of the attack, using his electronic keycard to track his movements through secure areas of the building. They are also reviewing his personal and professional lives trying to find a motive. “Right now we do not have anything glaring,” he said. “There’s nothing that hits you right between the eyes. But we are working on it.” Mr. Craddock appeared to have had no felony record, making him eligible to purchase guns. Government investigators identified two .45-calibre pistols used in the attack, and all indicators were that he purchased them legally in 2016 and 2018, said Ashan Benedict, the regional special agent for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The police chief said at least one had a noise suppressor. City officials uttered the gunman’s name just once and said they would not mention it again. Officers found victims throughout the building, on three floors. Among the dead were four other engineers who worked to maintain streets and protect wetlands and three right-of-way agents who reviewed property lines. Others included an account clerk, a technician, an administrative assistant and a special projects co-ordinator. In all, they had served the city of Virginia Beach for more than 150 years. The 12th fatality was a contractor who was in the building seeking a permit. At least four other people who were wounded remained in hospital in critical condition Sunday. A handwritten note was posted Saturday at the suspect’s home expressing condolences to the shooting victims on behalf of his family. Co-workers described him as quiet, nice and polite, and neighbours said he was into cars and bodybuilding. Two city workers said Sunday that they are lucky to be alive after coming face-to-face with the gunman during his rampage. Terry Inman, an account clerk in the city’s public utilities department, said he turned around and saw Mr. Craddock standing there with a gun. Mr. Inman said he told him, “DeWayne, stop!” “He turned and looked straight at me, but he didn’t see me. He looked straight in my face, and he did not see me standing there because he didn’t raise the gun. He didn’t even make an indication that he saw anyone there,” Mr. Inman told The Associated Press. “To me, that was the Holy Spirit inflecting something on that man to the point where he didn’t see Terry Inman standing there.” Mr. Inman’s colleague, Ned Carlstrom, crossed paths with the gunman three times and made eye contact twice. He can only guess that Mr. Craddock spared him because they parked near each other and often had lighthearted conversations during the morning walk to the building. “He had the gun down at his side. He was so close to me. He swung his arm out. He damn near hit me with the gun. That’s how close we were,” Mr. Carlstrom said. “But he never raised the gun at me. He looked up at me briefly.” Mr. Inman said he did not know of any turmoil in Mr. Craddock’s life. “It’s so cotton-picking cliche you almost hate to say it, but he has always been rock-solid kind of positive guy. He always had a smile on his face,” Mr. Inman said. “Nothing in [his] character would cause you to think, ‘This guy is going to come in and kill 11 of my colleagues ... 12 people that work in the same building.“’ "|"Virginia Beach gunman told boss of resignation hours before shooting"|"2019-06-02T12:13:52-0400"|"DeWayne Craddock,Virginia beach attack,Virginia beach shooter,Virginia beach,Shooting,gun,chief,gunman,building,officer,guy,people,indication,Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms,Virginia Beach",

Baldor"|"U.S. Acting Defence Secretary Patrick Shanahan on Saturday denounced China’s efforts to steal technology from other nations and militarize man-made outposts in the South China Sea as a “toolkit of coercion,” saying Beijing’s bad behaviour must end. In his first major speech on the international stage, Shanahan mixed sharp criticism of China and warnings of North Korea’s “extraordinary” threat with vows that the U.S. will remain strongly committed to the Indo-Pacific region and is ready to invest billions of dollars in securing its stability. While he didn’t specifically name China in early parts of his speech, he made clear who his target was, making pointed references to Beijing’s campaign to put advanced weapons systems on disputed islands in the region. “If these trends in these behaviours continue, artificial features in the global commons could become tollbooths. Sovereignty could become the purview of the powerful,” Shanahan said. His remarks underscore America’s frayed relations with China, as the Trump administration wages a trade war with Beijing, imposes sanctions on Chinese tech giant Huawei and approves a weapons sale to Taiwan, the self-ruled island the Communist mainland claims as its own territory. And they reflect America’s new national defence strategy that declared great power competition with China and Russia as top priorities. Shanahan’s speech on Saturday is also arguably an audition to both the world and U.S. top leaders in Congress, as his nomination for permanent secretary has still not been sent to Capitol Hill by President Donald Trump. And listening closely in the audience were nervous allies and partners in the region who are worried about the economic impact of the U.S.-China trade dispute and the political blowback of America’s complaints about Beijing’s rapid progress in hypersonic weapons, nuclear technology and space launches. Shanahan told reporters Friday that he would use his speech to the Shangri-La Dialogue conference to criticize Beijing’s use of coercion to advance its interests. And after his remarks, during questions from the audience, he suggested that his speech was more directly critical than those of other U.S. defence secretaries in the past. “I won’t apologize for the way I framed some of my remarks, but we’re not going to ignore Chinese behaviour,” Shanahan said. “I think in the past people have kind of tiptoed around that. It’s not about being confrontational, it’s about being open and having a dialogue.” He added that the U.S. is willing to co-operate with China and welcomes competition, but said behaviour that erodes other nations’ sovereignty and sows distrust of China’s intentions must end. “Competition does not mean conflict,” he said. “Competition is not to be feared. We should welcome it, provided that everyone plays by internationally established rules.” He also rejected suggestions that the U.S. is in a “faceoff” or trade war with China and said economic negotiations with Beijing are ongoing and the Pentagon is building relations with the Chinese military. But he went on to restate America’s distrust of Huawei, the world’s No. 1 network equipment provider and second-largest smartphone maker. The U.S. claims Huawei is legally beholden to China’s ruling Communists, which could use the company’s products, including its next-generation wireless network known as 5G, for cyberespionage. Shanahan said Huawei is “too close to the government” of China, which has laws requiring data be shared. “That’s too much risk for the department,” said Shanahan. “You can’t trust that those networks are going to be protected. China on Friday warned that it was drawing up a list of “unreliable” foreign companies, organizations and individuals for targeting in what could signal retaliation for U.S. sanctions on Huawei. Much of Shanahan’s speech centred on America’s work with partners across the region. “The Indo-Pacific is our priority theatre,” he said. “We are where we belong. We are investing in the region. We are investing in you, and with you.” But he also called on the Pacific nations to invest in their own futures. On North Korea, Shanahan said the U.S. is focused on negotiations to achieve full denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, adding that the North “has neared a point where it could credibly strike regional allies, U.S. territory and our forward-deployed forces.” He credited China for its co-operation on enforcing UN sanctions against Pyongyang. In a departure from past conferences, however, Shanahan faced little backlash from the Chinese leaders in the audience during the question-and-answer session. On Friday, Chinese defence ministry spokesman Wu Qian was both conciliatory and challenging. Speaking to reporters after Chinese Defence Minister Wei Fenghe met with Shanahan, Wu noted that the U.S. has recently “had a series of negative words and deeds” on Taiwan issues. “On the issue of safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity, the U.S. should not underestimate the determination of the Chinese military, will or ability,” he said. But he also said Shanahan and Wei found room for agreement on the need for denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and efforts to improve communication between the U.S. and China. Shanahan told reporters Friday that the U.S. needs to do a better job of describing its level of commitment to the region, including military exercises, training and other activities.

"193"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-taiwan-says-china-must-sincerely-repent-for-tiananmen-square/"|"Yimou Lee Ben Blanchard"|"China must “sincerely repent” for the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in and around Tiananmen Square three decades ago, Taiwan said on Monday, as a Chinese newspaper said nobody in China was interested in dragging up the past. Tuesday marks 30 years since Chinese troops opened fire to end the student-led unrest. Chinese authorities ban any public commemoration of the event on the mainland and have never released a full death toll. Estimates from human rights groups and witnesses range from several hundred to several thousand. “China has to sincerely repent for the June 4 incident and pro-actively push for democratic reforms,” Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council said in a statement likely to infuriate China. “We earnestly admonish the Chinese authorities to face up to the historical mistake, and sincerely apologize as soon as possible.” The council said Beijing had been telling lies to cover up the events of 1989 and distorting the truth. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang, asked about Taiwan’s statement, said the great achievements since the People’s Republic of China was founded 70 years ago “fully prove that the development path we have chosen is completely correct”. China’s widely read tabloid the Global Times said in a Monday editorial on the website of its English-language edition that June 4 had “immunized China against turmoil”. “Merely afflicting China once, the incident has not become a long-term nightmare for the country,” the paper, published by the ruling Communist Party’s official People’s Daily, said. “It has become a faded historical event, rather than an actual entanglement,” it added, blasting dissidents and those outside the country who keep talking about it. “However, all these noises will have no real impact on Chinese society. The actions of the external forces are completely in vain.” The far more well-read Chinese-language version of the paper did not carry the editorial. The newspaper has previously written about Tiananmen – in English – so the editorial is not unprecedented, but still rare as public discussion of the event is taboo in China. Beijing has increased government suppression of rights activism, pushing the demonstrators’ original goals further away than ever. Democratic Taiwan tends to use the Tiananmen Square anniversary to criticize China and call for it to face up to what it did. China claims self-ruled Taiwan as its sacred territory, to be taken back by force if necessary. Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said June 4, 1989, was a “historic turning point” for China, which had since taken a different path for democratic development. “Very unfortunately, although China had made progress in economic development in recent years, its human rights and freedom were still greatly oppressed,” she said in a meeting with overseas rights activists. “We also care a lot about the development of democracy and human rights in mainland China, and hope China could walk toward that path,” she was cited as saying in a statement from the Presidential Office. Chinese Defence Minister Wei Fenghe on Sunday defended Beijing’s handling of Tiananmen, saying the government “was decisive in stopping the turbulence,” a rare official acknowledgment of the events of June 4. Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council said such remarks in defence of the Chinese military’s handling of the protests were “incredible”. “It proves that them keeping saying ‘Chinese people don’t attack Chinese people’ is a gargantuan lie.” China has been ramping up the pressure on Taiwan, which holds presidential elections in January, whittling away at its few remaining diplomatic allies and regularly sending air force jets close to the island. Beijing suspects Tsai and her ruling Democratic Progressive Party of pushing formal independence for Taiwan, a red line for China. Tsai repeatedly says she wants to maintain the status quo but vows to defend the island’s democracy. China’s defence minister, also speaking on Sunday, said the military would fight “if anyone dares to split Taiwan from China”. Taiwan’s defence ministry labelled Wei’s remarks “bellicose” and a clear threat to peace and security.

The 69-year-old Brigitte Bierlein, previously the head of Austria’s top court, will lead a Cabinet of non-partisan experts. “I am particularly glad … that for the first time in history we will have a female chancellor at the head of the government, and secondly that women and men are equally represented in this government,” President Alexander Van der Bellen said as he swore in the new team. “In the future, no one will be able to say ‘unfortunately that’s not possible.“’ Bierlein was named as interim leader after Sebastian Kurz lost a confidence vote a week ago, following the collapse of a governing coalition of his right-wing People’s Party and the far-right Freedom Party. That followed the publication of a video showing Freedom Party leader Heinz-Christian Strache appearing to offer lucrative government contracts to a purported Russian investor. Bierlein pledged stability and assured Austrians that they were in good hands. She said a government needed to have transparent rules, be open to dialogue and constructive disagreement, and to entertain a diversity of opinion. “That was my core belief as a judge, and it remains my belief as chancellor,” she said. As he swore in the new Cabinet, Van der Bellen called on Austrians not to “turn away” from politics. Bierlein appealed specifically to the country’s youth, particularly young women, to help make a “strong, livable and tolerant Austria.” “Our land, our democracy needs all of you, your creative strength and your belief in Austria,” she said. “Your engagement is irreplaceable for the health of our republic and all of Europe.” Bierlein’s deputy at the constitutional Court, Christoph Grabenwarter, took over the leadership of the tribunal following her nomination as chancellor.

"195"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-german-spd-leader-resigns-in-blow-to-merkels-ruling-coalition/"|"Holger Hansen Edward Taylor"|"Andrea Nahles said on Sunday she would resign as leader of Germany’s Social Democrats (SPD), raising new doubts about the durability of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s ruling coalition with the centre-left party. Merkel’s Christian Democrats and the SPD both bled support in last week’s European elections as voters turned away from mainstream political parties, undermining a ruling coalition that already came close to falling apart last year. Nahles, whose SPD is a junior coalition partner in Merkel’s ruling alliance, said she would resign as party leader on Monday and step down as head of the SPD’s parliamentary group on Tuesday. “The discussions within the parliamentary faction and feedback from within the party have shown me that I no longer have the necessary support to carry out my duties,” Nahles said in a statement released by the SPD. The “grand coalition” is due to rule until 2021 but Nahles’ resignation could trigger the SPD’s early exit, forcing Merkel to call snap elections, to lead a minority government, or to seek an alliance with the Greens and liberal Free Democrats. “The election for the party leadership is likely to be a vote on the grand coalition,” said Henrik Enderlein, president of the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin. “Whoever runs will have to answer the crucial question of whether to participate in the government. “New elections later this year are not excluded,” Enderlein added. “A minority government at the end of the era Merkel could possibly be an interim solution.” The turmoil within the SPD comes as Merkel’s conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) faces its own struggles. Germany’s Greens have overtaken the conservatives to become the country’s most popular party, an opinion poll showed on Saturday, with SPD support sinking to an all-time low. CDU leader and Merkel’s heir apparent Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer called on the SPD to ensure Germany has a stable and functioning government. “I am assuming that the SPD will make its personnel decisions quickly and that the grand coalition’s ability to act will not be impaired,” she said on Sunday. Alexander Dobrindt, a lawmaker from the CSU Bavarian party in Merkel’s coalition, echoed her view. “I expect a clear commitment from the SPD to back the coalition,” Dobrindt said. Nahles had been due to face a vote on her leadership position on Tuesday after her decision to stay in coalition with Merkel’s conservative bloc following the European elections setback was criticized by the SPD’s left. The SPD also failed to win the most votes in the state of Bremen for the first time in 73 years last Sunday. Earlier, German Vice Chancellor Olaf Scholz, a Social Democrat, told Germany’s Tagesspiegel that he had ruled out entering another grand coalition as the SPD seeks to regroup. “I am very sure that it would not be justifiable for us to have a fifth grand coalition,” Scholz told the German paper in an interview published on Sunday before Nahles announced she would resign. “Three grand coalitions in a row would not do democracy in Germany any good,” he was quoted as saying. The ruling coalition is due for a midterm review in the autumn, which could be an opportunity for the SPD to pull the plug on the alliance. The SPD is now scrambling to put an end to infighting to stabilize its leadership. Speaking on the “Anne Will” political talk show on Sunday evening, Scholz ruled himself out as an interim or full-time replacement for Nahles. Last week, German weekly Bild am Sonntag reported that former SPD leader Martin Schulz wanted to replace Nahles as head of the parliamentary party. Schulz told Germany’s Welt am Sonntag newspaper that he would not stand against Nahles in the leadership vote on Tuesday but declined to answer whether he would seek to be re-elected leader thereafter. “Wow, another earthquake in German politics,” said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING Germany, referring to the upheaval within the SPD party.

"196"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-senior-north-korean-official-appears-in-state-media-days-after-purge/"|"Kim Tong-Hyung"|"A senior North Korean official who had been reported to be sentenced to hard labour over the failed nuclear summit with Washington was shown in state media on Monday enjoying a concert near leader Kim Jong-un. North Korean publications on Monday showed Kim Yong Chol sitting five seats away from a clapping Kim Jong-un in the same row along with other top officials during a musical performance by the wives of Korean People’s Army officers. A report by Pyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency named Kim Yong Chol among the attendees of the event, which it said “impressively represented the ideological and mental features of KPA officers’ wives, who make every moment of their life honourable with ardent yearning for the leader.” Kim Yong Chol has been North Korea’s top nuclear negotiator and the counterpart of U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo since Kim Jong-un entered nuclear talks with the U.S. early last year. He travelled to Washington and met President Donald Trump twice before Kim’s two summits with Trump. Negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang have been at a standstill since February, when the second summit between Trump and Kim broke down over what the United States described as excessive North Korean demands for sanctions relief in exchange for only a partial surrender of its nuclear capabilities. Last week, South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo cited an unidentified source in reporting that Kim Yong Chol had been sentenced to hard labour and ideological re-education over the failed summit in Hanoi, Vietnam’s capital. The newspaper also reported that senior envoy Kim Hyok Chol, who was involved in pre-summit working-level talks with American officials, was executed with four other officials from the North’s Foreign Ministry for betraying Kim Jong-un after being won over by the United States. None of the allegedly executed officials have appeared in state media since the report. But as ever with North Korea, a country that closely guards its secrets, there are reasons to be cautious about the purported purge. South Korea’s government and media have a mixed record on tracking developments among North Korea’s ruling elite, made difficult by Pyongyang’s stringent control of information about them. When asked about Kim Yong Chol’s reappearance in public, Lee Sang-min, spokesman for Seoul’s Unification Ministry, which deals with inter-Korean affairs, said the ministry would not comment on a “specific internal event in North Korea or its participants.” Seoul’s spy service has said it could not confirm Friday’s report of a possible purge, while the presidential Blue House cautioned against “hasty judgments or comments.” Pompeo said after the report came out that he had seen it and the U.S. was “doing our best to check it out.” The report came at a delicate time for diplomacy as North Korea in past weeks has tested short-range missiles and issued belligerent rhetoric toward American and South Korean officials. Kim Jong-un declared in April that the Trump administration has until the end of the year to come up with mutually acceptable terms for a deal to salvage the nuclear negotiations. Experts say the North is using measured brinkmanship aimed at increasing pressure on Washington without actually causing the negotiations to collapse. North Korea has previously executed scapegoats to atone for high-profile political flops. But while many experts believe Kim Yong Chol was pushed to a back seat in negotiations with the United States, there were doubts about the report of a purge. Cheong Seong-Chang, an analyst at South Korea’s Sejong Institute, said Kim Yong Chol, who is also rumoured to have health problems, wouldn’t have appeared in public this quickly if he was undergoing political re-education. Cheong said it wouldn’t make sense for Kim Jong-un to execute Kim Hyok Chol when Kim Yong Chol, the more senior official, would be seen as more responsible for the failure in Hanoi. “If Kim Jong-un sentences senior officials to hard labour, executes them, or puts them in political prison camps over the collapse of meetings, then no official would be willing to step up in external negotiations,” Cheong said. “It’s unlikely that Kim would issue extreme punishment unless he’s giving up on the talks with the United States.” Kim Yong Chol’s rise during the nuclear negotiations had baffled many North Korea watchers because he handled South Korea ties, not international or U.S. relations. Previously, he was a military intelligence chief believed to be behind a slew of provocations, including two deadly attacks in 2010 that killed 50 South Koreans and an alleged 2014 cyberattack on Sony Pictures. Both Seoul and Washington imposed sanctions on him in recent years. Many experts in South Korea believe experienced foreign ministry hands such as Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho and First Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui are likely to take the lead in North Korea’s nuclear diplomacy as it prepares for the possibility of protracted and highly complicated negotiations with Washington.

"197"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-palestinian-classes-nearly-double-in-size-as-un-budget-dries-up/"|"Isabel Debre"|"Majed Jameel was overwhelmed. This wasn’t the kind of pressure he’d grown accustomed to as a teacher in the volatile West Bank city of Hebron. On a recent, not uncommon occasion, clashes erupted between students and Israeli soldiers, sending volleys of tear gas into the playground. That he could handle. This was a different stress. After the Trump administration slashed funding last year to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, Jameel saw his classes nearly doubled in size. His disciplined social studies class at the Hebron Boys’ School had become a crowded, unruly scene: Four children squeezed at desks made for two, dozens of hands shooting in the air at the same time, noise snowballing when he paused for questions. He said the classroom is louder and filled with distractions. “You spend most of the class time restraining student interactions or fights and have no time left to track their homework and classwork … or give one-on-one help.” The effects of U.S. aid cuts have rippled throughout UNRWA’s operations, but its sprawling school system, serving 500,000 children across the Middle East, has been hit hardest. With money dried up and widespread austerity measures in place, the agency says it can no longer accommodate a natural influx of students, recruit new teachers or expand to larger facilities. Peter Mulrean, the agency’s New York representative, said average class sizes in the West Bank have grown from 30 students a year ago to 50. “There’s a huge difference between correcting exams for 27 students and for 47 students,” said Jameel. “I just want things go back to how they were last year.” Students, too, say they’ve felt a major shift. “It’s been really hard for me to understand what’s going on in class this year,” said Suhail Jaber, a ninth-grader at the Hebron school. “If the teacher stops to explain things when we’re confused, I feel class is suddenly over and I won’t ever understand.” Ali Azazmeh, 10, said he’s stopped even trying. “With all the heads in front of me I can’t see the board anyway.” In early 2018, the U.S., which was UNRWA’s biggest donor for decades, cut its contributions from $360-million to $60-million. In 2019, U.S. contributions are zero. In a recent address to the UN Security Council, U.S. Mideast envoy Jason Greenblatt said the UNRWA model “has failed the Palestinian people.” “The UNRWA model cannot provide to Palestinians what they deserve – a life where they can plan for their future and the future of their children, and one where they know whether schools and health clinics will remain open,” he said. He called for “host governments” and other aid organizations to fill the void. UNRWA was established in the wake of the 1948 Mideast war surrounding Israel’s creation to aid the estimated 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were forced from their homes in the fighting. In the absence of a political solution, the UN General Assembly has repeatedly renewed UNRWA’s mandate. Today, the agency serves some 5 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, as well as Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, who view it as a vital safety net, providing services that governments do not. Symbolically, Palestinians see UNRWA as sustaining their core demand that refugees have the “right of return” to their lost homes in what is now Israel – a prospect that Israel rejects. Critics in the U.S. and Israel accuse the agency of perpetuating the conflict and promoting a culture of welfare dependency by maintaining an ever-growing population of refugees. Instead of working to resettle the refugees, critics say UNRWA allows refugee status to be passed down for generations, even in cases where they have gained citizenship elsewhere, such as Jordan. UNRWA rejects the criticism, pointing out that refugees in other conflicts also maintain their status. It says it is carrying out a UN-mandated mission that reflects the will of the international community. The best way to solve the refugee problem, it says, is to find a political solution to the conflict that addresses the fate of the refugees. After the U.S. cuts, an aggressive fundraising push hauled in major contributions from European and Gulf countries, which filled a $1.2-billion shortfall so that schools, health clinics and food distribution centres could stay afloat. But UNRWA is still reeling from the U.S. funding lapse. “When you hear that we’ve maintained our programs and reduced our deficit, what you don’t see is that the quality of our services is under threat,” said Mulrean, noting that UNRWA has saved over $92-million last year in internal cuts. “There already wasn’t much fat to cut. Now we’re at the bone.” Beyond crowded classes, casualties of the cutbacks include layoffs to hundreds of part-time helpers and substitutes, intensifying pressure on overworked teachers who “now no longer have the luxury of getting sick, unless their colleague takes on an additional 50 students,” said Tamara Alrifai, an UNRWA spokeswoman. The agency also cut psychosocial counselling, adding to concerns that the neediest kids will bear the brunt of austerity, especially in Gaza, which has gone through repeated rounds of bloody clashes with Israel. UNRWA says 81 per cent of Gazan children struggle in school due to conflict-related stress. Long before the U.S. cuts, the school system in the crowded Gaza Strip had been vexed by an excess of kids and lack of buildings, the majority of which are shared in double or triple shifts. Since the spending freeze, a handful of students have been added to classes that already contained between 40-50 students, said Adnan Abu Hasna, the agency’s media adviser in Gaza. After the U.S. recognized contested Jerusalem as Israel’s capital in December 2017, the Palestinians cut off ties with the White House. The Palestinians believe the cuts to UNRWA, along with an end to hundreds of millions of dollars in other aid, are part of a broader U.S. effort to deal them a political blow. Later this month, the White House is scheduled to unveil the first stage of its long-awaited Mideast peace plan at an economic conference in the Gulf state of Bahrain. The aim is to raise funds from wealthy Arab countries and other donors for large-scale investment in the Palestinian territories. Palestinian politicians have rejected the forum’s parameters, saying they won’t give up their national aspirations in exchange for economic incentives. In his address to the Security Council, Greenblatt noted the “irony” that the Bahrain conference had been scheduled for the same days as UNRWA’s annual fundraising conference. “I acknowledge I have not brought with me today a solution,” he said. “What we do know is that what we have today is not the answer.” But in the absence of answers, Mulrean said millions of Palestinians are suffering. “The U.S. has set a precedent, and at the end of the day, it’s the most vulnerable people who pay the price,” he said.

"198"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-applications-for-asylum-in-canada-for-syrian-white-helmets-stalled/"|"Mark MacKinnon"|"Ten members of Syria’s White Helmets and their families are still living in a refugee camp in the Jordanian desert, with their applications for asylum in Canada stalled over security concerns, nearly a year after the federal government won plaudits for leading the operation to save them. They were among 422 people who escaped southern Syria last July in a one-day operation that was concluded just as President Bashar al-Assad’s forces, who have repeatedly targeted the White Helmets throughout the conflict, recaptured the rebel-held Daraa region. The White Helmets, a volunteer rescue group, gained fame for their collective bravery while trying to save victims of Syria’s eight-year-old civil war. The international rescue, which saw Israel open its heavily militarized border in the Golan Heights so that the White Helmets could be whisked to safety in neighbouring Jordan, was a diplomatic triumph for Ottawa, with Canadian diplomats – including Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland – heralded for helping make it happen. But nearly a year later, Ms. Freeland finds herself at the centre of another complicated diplomatic endeavour: trying to resolve the fate of the 10 families who remain in Jordan’s Azraq refugee camp, long after the Jordanian government had been promised they’d be resettled to one of Canada, Germany or Britain. Germany and Britain have each taken in their agreed share of the 422 evacuees, and Canada resettled 117 of the Syrians last year (Ms. Freeland’s office declined to say how many refugees total Canada agreed to resettle). But 10 families – at least 42 people – remain in Azraq, an austere tent city 80 kilometres east of Amman that’s also home to more than 30,000 other Syrians. Four sources with direct knowledge of the situation, who were granted anonymity by The Globe and Mail because they were not authorized to speak publicly, said the 10 families were rejected by Canada over security concerns that were uncovered by Canadian officials who travelled to Jordan to interview the White Helmets and their families. Canada, the sources said, was now trying to find another country or countries willing to accept the families. However, Ms. Freeland said in a phone interview that saying the 10 families had been rejected by Canada was “putting the cart before the horse.” She said the cases were still under review. “The reality is these are people who survived in an incredibly difficult, incredibly chaotic environment,” she said. “They were living really in the cauldron of a civil war, and they had to flee, very many of them, with just the clothes on their backs. Those two realities mean, I think quite understandably, that doing due diligence can take a long time.” “One thing that we have found is other partner countries from around the world have become aware of the situation of the White Helmets, and have real sympathy for that situation. So, we are also working with other countries who are interested in being part of this effort.” One source with knowledge of the situation said in at least two of the 10 cases, the families were denied entry to Canada because immigration screeners found photographs of armed individuals – something many Syrians would have simply from living in a war zone since 2011 – on their mobile phones. Ms. Freeland said she couldn’t talk about specifics of the cases or confirm the exact number of White Helmets still waiting in Jordan. Jordan is showing signs of exasperation with the delay. The country already hosted 655,000 registered Syrian refugees on its soil before the White Helmets arrived, but the actual number of Syrians in Jordan is often estimated to be twice as large. Foreign Affairs Minister Ayman Safadi said earlier this year the White Helmets had only been allowed into the country “on a transit basis, after some Western countries made binding written commitments they would relocate them out of the kingdom.” Mr. Safadi told Russia’s Sputnik news agency that 42 members of the White Helmets and their families were still in the country as of January, a number that one source said had grown closer to 50, as children have been born in the refugee camp. “From the very beginning, we said that we will not accept them as refugees. We said they will not stay in Jordan,” Mr. Safadi said. The situation risks turning a diplomatic triumph into something of an embarrassment for Canada, given that it was Ms. Freeland who embraced the cause of the trapped White Helmets last summer, making an impassioned speech to a gathering of NATO foreign ministers that helped rally support for the international rescue mission. “Everyone who’s involved in the process is very keen this doesn’t become an issue that languishes,” James Le Mesurier, a former British army officer who helped found the White Helmets in 2014, said of the 10 families still in Jordan. “There’s a lot of diplomatic engagement, a lot of personal commitment.” The fact the 10 cases were rejected by Canada because of security concerns awkwardly fits with a narrative advanced by Mr. al-Assad’s regime and its allies: that the White Helmets are not the civilian heroes that Western governments have made them out to be. The Assad regime and Russia have both claimed for years that the White Helmets were de facto participants in Syria’s war, with ties to Islamist fighters opposed to Mr. al-Assad. Ms. Freeland said the Syrian and Russian propaganda regarding the White Helmets was intended to discredit one of the few groups able to shine a light on the brutal methods that Syrian and Russian forces have used to crush the anti-Assad opposition. The group’s practice of making videos of its rescue operations and posting them online helped stir international outrage against the Assad regime over the course of the war. Videos made by the White Helmets also provided the initial evidence – later substantiated by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons – that the regime had used chemical weapons against its opponents. “In a way, those smears [by Russia and the Assad regime] are a badge of honour for the White Helmets organization, because they are a direct result of their work in rescuing civilians, and also of their work in documenting atrocities and war crimes,” Ms. Freeland said. The war, meanwhile, grinds on. While Mr. al-Assad’s forces have recaptured much of Syria, Turkish-backed opposition forces still control most of Idlib province, in the northwest of the country, while U.S.-allied Kurdish fighters have carved out a de facto autonomous zone east of the Euphrates River. Mr. al-Assad’s forces, supported by Russian warplanes, have recently launched an assault on rebel-held Idlib, meaning that the White Helmets who remain in the country are once more on the front lines of a conflict that has already killed more than 500,000 people and driven millions more from their homes. Mr. Le Mesurier said there were about 2,800 volunteer White Helmets still active in Syria, 2,300 of whom are in and around the Idlib region. On Thursday, the group posted one video of its rescuers pulling the dead bodies of a father and his infant daughter from the ruins of a building in southern Idlib. The group said the video was taken “after air strikes by regime warplanes.” Another video posted Thursday showed White Helmets working to rescue a young boy from the aftermath of another air strike while his brother lay dead in the rubble beside him. Earlier this month, a White Helmets’ rescue centre in Idlib was destroyed in another air strike that the group believes was intentional. “The Syrian regime and its allies continue to target rescue workers and medical facilities as an essential part of their military campaign,” Mr. Le Mesurier said. “The White Helmets continue doing whatever they can, whenever they can, for as long as they can.” "|"Applications for asylum in Canada for Syrian White Helmets stalled over security concerns"|"2019-06-02T19:45:13-0400"|"Syria,White Helmets,refugee camp,Jordan,asylum,Bashar al-Assad,Golan Heights,Chrystia Freeland,foreign policy,civil war,white,canada,jordan,syria,country",

Twenty-eight people are presumed to have died when The Mermaid, a pleasure boat carrying 33 South Korean tourists and two Hungarian crew, capsized and sank after being hit by a cruise liner in the centre of Budapest on Wednesday. South Korean and Hungarian divers worked as a team on Monday in an attempt to recover bodies from the wreck, the first day they have been able to approach it after currents and storm waters kept them away. Seven bodies were recovered on the night of the accident and seven Koreans were rescued alive. The authorities have said the other 21 people on board are all presumed to have been killed in the worst disaster on the Danube for more than half a century. Hungarian divers found a body in the morning during an exploratory dive at the wreck, and later in the day South Korean divers pulled it from the river, the Hungarian counterterrorism unit TEK, which is in charge of the rescue, said in a statement. It released no further details. Police said another body found earlier on Monday near a village 115 km downriver from the capital had been identified as the eighth victim of the disaster. Authorities were still working to identify the body pulled from the river in Budapest. The Mermaid capsized after being struck from behind by a large cruise liner near a bridge in the centre of Budapest in driving rain. After days in which Hungarian divers were unable to reach the wreck, South Korea sent its own recovery team which joined the operation on Monday. “We are co-operating with Korean colleagues; this is a joint operation now,” Janos Hajdu, the chief of Hungary’s TEK, told a news conference. The South Korean rescue team aims to recover bodies while the shipwreck is still on the river bed. The Hungarians say that is a possibility but they have also considered lifting the hull out of the water first. TEK’s Hajdu said conditions had improved enough to launch several exploratory missions a day to the wreck but that entering it was potentially very dangerous. “If we find bodies we will do everything to respect funerary aspects,” Hajdu said. Lifting the ship would be possible only once the waters subside enough for Hungary’s largest crane to fit under Budapest’s bridges and approach the site, he added. The Ukrainian captain of the Viking Sigyn cruise liner which collided with The Mermaid has been detained and faces a criminal investigation. He denies wrongdoing. Video footage from surveillance cameras show the bigger ship bearing down on the smaller vessel as they both pass under the bridge. A captain of another boat on duty nearby at the time of the accident told private news channel TV2 on Sunday that the captain of the cruise liner never radioed the smaller vessel. “We heard nothing of any kind of an attempted overtaking manoeuvre, warning, or danger signal on the radio,” Zoltan Tolnay said. After the crash, the Ukrainian captain spoke on the radio in an unintelligible mix of Russian, English and German words, Tolnay said. “I only learned from a later Hungarian shipping statement that there had been a disaster,” he added.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the number of cases of the highly contagious and sometimes deadly disease rose 4 per cent in the week ended May 31 from the prior week. The 2019 outbreak, which has spread to 26 states, is the worst since 1992, when 2,126 cases were recorded. Federal health officials attribute this year’s outbreak to U.S. parents who refuse to vaccinate their children. These parents believe, contrary to scientific evidence, that ingredients in the vaccine can cause autism. The disease has mostly affected children who have not received the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, which confers immunity to the disease. On Thursday, CDC officials said the outbreak had surpassed the total number of cases per year for the past 25 years, topping the 963 cases that were confirmed in 1994. Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000, meaning there was no continuous transmission of the disease for a year. Still, cases of the virus occur and spread via travellers coming from countries where measles is common. CDC officials have warned that the country risks losing its measles elimination status if the ongoing outbreak, which began in October 2018 in New York, continues until October 2019. “Measles is preventable and the way to end this outbreak is to ensure that all children and adults who can get vaccinated, do get vaccinated,” CDC Director Robert Redfield said in a statement on Thursday. “I want to reassure parents that vaccines are safe, they do not cause autism.” The outbreak has escalated since 82 people in 2018 and more than 40 people in 2019 brought measles to the United States from other countries, most frequently Ukraine, Israel and the Philippines, federal officials said.

"201"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-italian-pm-giuseppe-conte-threatens-to-resign-tells-coalition-to-end/"|"Giuseppe Fonte Crispian Balmer"|"Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte threatened on Monday to resign, telling his two coalition partners to end their constant feuding or seek new elections. Conte, an academic with no political support base, called a news conference to make the extraordinary ultimatum after months of bickering inside his year-old coalition of right-wing populists and anti-establishment lawmakers. “I’m not here just to scrape by or drift,” Conte told reporters at his official residence. “If they do not clearly assume their responsibilities … then I will resign.” The leaders of both the League and 5-Star Movement, Matteo Salvini and Luigi Di Maio respectively, swiftly issued statements reaffirming their commitment to the government, while denying that they were to blame for the political turmoil. The two parties have been squabbling over everything from major infrastructure projects and immigration to the historical significance of national holidays and who was to blame for a cruise ship accident in Venice at the weekend. The feud has intensified since European parliamentary elections last month in which the League won 34 per cent of the vote, leapfrogging above 5-Star and fuelling speculation that Salvini could ditch his struggling coalition partner. Salvini took to Twitter even as Conte was talking, saying he wanted to carry on. “We are ready, we want to move forward and don’t have any time to lose. The League is in,” he tweeted. Di Maio responded shortly afterwards, saying he was ready for a government meeting as early as Tuesday to discuss issues such as tax cuts dear to the League and the introduction of a minimum wage, which 5-Star wants. “This is the only government possible which can best serve the nation,” he wrote on Facebook. Conte told reporters his cabinet faced a complex 2020 budget and said Italy needed the confidence of financial markets. During the recent government infighting, investors sold off Italian bonds, raising fears for Rome’s ability to manage its enormous public debt of around €2.3-trillion ($2.6-trillion). “We must not let sterile controversies and pointless arguments waste our precious energy or distract from government objectives,” Conte said. Italy faces the possibility of European Union disciplinary procedures this week for a breach of EU fiscal rules, which Salvini says are outdated and harmful to the Italian economy. Conte said any EU sanctions would be very harmful, adding that the government had to abide by EU budget rules until such time as they could be changed. Repeated sniping from within coalition ranks only undermined his position, he said. “All problems, even the thorniest, can be tackled, but a climate of co-operation and mutual help is needed. Without this, it is difficult to face such delicate challenges.” Since the EU election, Salvini has demanded swingeing tax cuts for Italy and dismissed EU calls for fiscal discipline. Italian media reported on Monday that if Conte could not restore order to his government, President Sergio Mattarella would probably dissolve parliament in July and set a new election for September.

He was 71. Mr. Erickson’s sinuous lead guitar and wailing vocals didn’t turn him into a chart topper, but they cemented his role as a musician’s musician. Fans included everyone from Lenny Kaye and the Swedish metal group Ghost – who covered his If You Have Ghosts – to ZZ Top’s Billy Gibbons. A 1990 tribute album to Mr. Erickson, Where the Pyramid Meets the Eye, attracted the likes of R.E.M., T-Bone Burnett, the Jesus and Mary Chain, Julian Cope, the Mighty Lemon Drops, Primal Scream and ZZ Top. Mr. Erickson’s death on Friday was announced by his brother, Mikel Erickson, on Facebook and confirmed by his agent, Dave Kaplan. The cause and location of death were not revealed. “It’s almost unfathomable to contemplate a world without Roky Erickson. He created his own musical galaxy and early on was a true inspiration,” Mr. Gibbons said in a statement. After the trippy 13th Floor Elevators dissolved in the face of drug arrests and instability, Mr. Erickson in the early seventies entered an insanity plea to a marijuana possession charge and ended up spending some time in an institution. A short-lived effort to reunite the Elevators followed. Mr. Erickson put out a book of poetry – Openers – and continued making music, including the songs Two Headed Dog and the LP The Evil One. In 1986, he released the album Don’t Slander Me, and a 2005 documentary by Keven McAlester about him was called You’re Gonna Miss Me. His later albums include the mid-1990s effort All That May Do My Rhyme, and a 2010 collaboration with Okkervil River, True Love Cast Out All Evil.

Trump posted a message on Twitter about the alleged Russian drawdown while on a state visit to London but did not provide any further details. The Trump administration, which backs opposition leader Juan Guaido as the country’s legitimate interim president, has insisted that Russian and Cuban support for Maduro has been essential to keeping him in power and has called for them to withdraw security personnel. Moscow sent nearly a hundred Russian special forces and cybersecurity personnel to Caracas in March, U.S. officials have said. Private military contractors who do secret missions for Russia flew into Venezuela in late January to beef up security for Maduro, according to people close to them. “Russia has informed us that they have removed most of their people from Venezuela,” Trump tweeted. It was unclear exactly who Trump was referring to or how this was communicated to him, and the White House did not provide any clarity. There was also no immediate word from Moscow. However, if true, it could mark a significant setback for Maduro. Trump’s tweet followed a Wall Street Journal article on Sunday that said Russia’s state defence contractor Rostec had cuts its staff in Venezuela to just a few dozen, citing a person close to the Russian defence ministry. Most other Western countries also support Guaido, who invoked the constitution in January to assume the interim presidency, arguing that Maduro’s 2018 re-election was illegitimate. Maduro has the backing of Russia, China and Cuba and continues to control most state institutions, including the military. Trump, who had previously called for Russia to “get out” of Venezuela, said following a phone call with President Vladimir Putin last month that the Russian leader was “not looking at all to get involved in Venezuela.” Trump’s comments appeared to contradict his aides’ harsher assessments of Russia’s role in the crisis-stricken South American country.

"204"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-china-warns-students-academics-about-studying-in-us/"|"Nathan VanderKlippe"|"The Chinese government has issued a warning to students and academics about studying in the United States in what observers called the latest reprisal in a deepening set of frictions between the world’s two largest economic powers. China’s Ministry of Education cited a series of difficulties for those travelling to the United States for studies, including rising rates of visa rejections and declining visa durations. In a brief warning posted to its website, the ministry said it “wants to remind all students and academics to reinforce risk assessment, improve the awareness of prevention and prepare accordingly before going abroad to study.” More than 360,000 Chinese students were registered to study in the United States in the 2017-18 school year – a third of all foreign students there – and the announcement sent a chill through the education sector in China on Monday. “I cannot emphasize enough what a major sea change this represents,” said Jiang Xueqin, a Harvard researcher and education consultant in China. “This warning is an official declaration that China will use both formal and informal mechanisms to decrease the number of Chinese students studying in the United States.” The stakes, he said, are high. “The government is saying that in a time of war – because they see this as a war between the U.S. and China – everyone is a soldier,” students included. Chinese education authorities have, in recent years, issued warnings about studying in a series of countries – last year, for example, urging students in Australia to be “vigilant” after several students were assaulted. But the cautionary note about the United States comes as Beijing and Washington take increasingly punitive measures against each other, as the trade war escalates into new attempts to inflict economic damage. The United States has raised tariffs and placed tech giant Huawei on a trade blacklist that means it cannot do business with U.S. companies without special permission. China has responded with its own tariffs, and is preparing an “unreliable entity list,” while state media have taken aim at Fedex, the shipping company, after several packages addressed to Huawei in China were diverted to other countries. Foreign students add US$42.4-billion to the U.S. economy, according to an estimate by the Institute of International Education and the U.S. Department of State. Chinese students alone brought US$13.9-billion in economic activity. But Xu Yongji, a spokesperson at China’s education ministry, said Monday that the U.S. rate of rejection of students funded by the China Scholarship Council has risen from 3.2 per cent last year to 13.5 per cent this year. He described accusations of “non-traditional espionage” levelled against Chinese students and scholars. China remains willing to “strengthen educational exchanges and co-operation,” he said. But “all of the actions mentioned above have caused damage to the dignity of Chinese students studying abroad and also seriously hurt the feeling of Chinese people,” Mr. Xu said. On China’s Twitter-like Weibo social network, people voiced bitterness toward the United States. ”It’s better to not go to the U.S. at all,” one wrote. “Chinese companies no longer consider overseas students attractive so it might be better to study and make one’s living in China.” “When does U.S. plan to publish its next Chinese Exclusion Act?” wrote another. “We are standing on the turning point of history,” added a third person. “I’m worried for other students who don’t yet have their visas,” said Katherine Zhang, 22, a finance major at Suzhou University. She has been accepted to a master’s program at a U.S. university – she declined to name which one – but said she expects other students to begin more seriously considering other countries for overseas study. For herself, meanwhile, “Personally, I will follow the steps suggested by [the] government – that is to get prepared and do risk evaluation,” she said. The United States, however, has long held a potent allure for Chinese students. Institutions such as Harvard, Yale and MIT define the “famous brand” of schools that are the object of educational ambition for many Chinese families. Even the daughter of President Xi Jinping studied at Harvard. For now, the desire to study in the United States ”will stay the same more or less,” said Shiny Wang, the director of college counselling at Tsinghua University High School in Beijing. Counsellors emphasize fit, steering students toward schools and programs best suited to their needs, regardless of country. However, he said, ”In the U.S., there are more choices with more opportunities and possibilities.” With reports from Alexandra Li "|"China warns students, academics about risks of studying in U.S. amid deepening tensions"|"2019-06-03T08:27:11-0400"|"china,u.s.,students,education,Huawei,U.S.-China trade war,international students,U.S. colleges,China’s Education Ministry,Xi Jinping,united,United States,student,war,harvard",

Olsen"|"WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange should not be extradited to Sweden for a revived rape investigation, but should still be questioned in the case while he is imprisoned in Britain, a Swedish court ruled Monday, The ruling by the Uppsala District Court doesn’t mean the preliminary investigation must be abandoned, only that Mr. Assange doesn’t face extradition to Sweden any time soon. Eva-Marie Persson, Sweden’s deputy director of public prosecutions, said she has not decided whether to appeal. “I will also issue a European Investigation Order in order to interview Julian Assange,” Ms. Persson said, adding that she hasn’t picked a possible date for the questioning in England. Mr. Assange’s lawyer in Sweden, Per E. Samuelsson, said his client would “be happy, we are happy” to learn he won’t be extradited to Sweden. The 47-year-old Mr. Assange was evicted on April 11 from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he had been holed up with political asylum since 2012. He was immediately arrested by British police and is currently serving a 50-week sentence for jumping bail in 2012. He is also fighting extradition to the United States, which accuses him of violating the Espionage Act by publishing secret documents hacked from the Pentagon containing the names of confidential military and diplomatic sources. Last week, Mr. Assange missed a court session in Britain, reportedly because of health problems. The allegations two Sweden women made against Mr. Assange stem from a trip to Stockholm he made in August, 2010. One of the women was involved in organizing a political event and offered to host Mr. Assange at her apartment. The other woman was in the audience. A police officer who heard the women’s accounts decided there was reason to suspect they were sex crime victims and handed the case to a prosecutor for further investigation. Mr. Assange has denied wrongdoing, asserting that the allegations were politically motivated and that the sex was consensual. The part of the probe dealing with sexual misconduct was dropped in 2017 when the statute of limitations for charging Mr. Assange with that crime expired. The rape allegation still could be prosecuted; the statute of limitations expires in August, 2020. Swedish authorities shelved the case while Mr. Assange was living at the Ecuadorian Embassy since there was no prospect of bringing him to Sweden for questioning. Mr. Assange is wanted in Sweden on suspicion of “intentionally having carried out an intercourse” with an unnamed woman “by unduly exploiting that she was in a helpless state because of sleep,” according to court documents. Mr. Assange faces a maximum of four years in prison in Sweden if he is convicted of rape.

"206"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-filing-blames-eu-migrant-policy-for-crimes-against-humanity/"|"Lori Hinnant"|"More than 40,000 people have been intercepted in the Mediterranean and taken to detention camps and torture houses under a European migration policy that is responsible for crimes against humanity, according to a legal document asking the International Criminal Court to take the case Monday. The request filed with the ICC alleges that European Union officials are knowingly responsible for deaths of migrants at land and sea, and their widespread rape and torture at the hands of a Libyan coast guard funded and trained at the expense of European taxpayers. It names no EU official but cites an ongoing ICC investigation into the fate of migrants in Libya. Officials with the European Commission, Germany and Spain defended EU policy and efforts to help migrants in Libya. France dismissed the accusations as “senseless” and lacking “any legal foundations.” The legal document cites public EU documents, statements from the French president, the German chancellor and other top officials from the bloc. “We leave it to the prosecutor, if he dares, if she dares, to go into the structures of power and to investigate at the heart of Brussels, of Paris, of Berlin and Rome and to see by searching in the archives of the meetings of the negotiations who was really behind the scenes trying to push for these policies that triggered the death of more than 14,000 people,” said Juan Branco, a lawyer who co-wrote the report and shared it with The Associated Press. The ICC is a court of last resort that handles cases of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide when other countries are unwilling or unable to prosecute. It is up to the prosecutor, who receives many such requests, to decide whether to investigate and ultimately bring a case. The EU spokeswoman in charge of migration, Natasha Bertaud, declined to comment directly on the court filing, but she and Germany’s government spokesman, Steffen Seibert, each placed blame for deaths at sea firmly on smugglers. “The EU’s track record on saving lives in the Mediterranean speaks for itself, saving lives has been our top priority and we have been working relentlessly to this end,” Bertaud said. The first crime, according to the document, was the decision to end the Mare Nostrum rescue operation near the end of 2014. In one year, the operation rescued 150,810 migrants in the Mediterranean as hundreds of thousands crossed the sea. The operation cost more than €9-million a month, nearly all paid for by Italy. It was replaced by an operation named Triton, financed by all 28 EU nations at a fraction of the cost. But unlike the earlier operation, Triton ships didn’t patrol directly off the Libyan coast, the origin of most of the flimsy smuggling boats that were taking off for Europe. Deaths in the Mediterranean then soared. In 2014, around 3,200 migrants died in the sea. The following year, it rose to over 4,000, and in 2016 peaked at over 5,100 deaths and disappearances, according to figures from the International Organization for Migration. “The objective of this new policy was to sacrifice the lives of many in order to impact the behaviour of more,” according to the complaint. “It also failed. Crossings did not decrease as predicted, because the risk had little deterrent effect on those who have little to lose to begin with.” Bertaud said the EU quickly realized its mistake in ending the Mare Nostrum operation and tripled its rescue capacity in 2015, helping save the lives of 730,000 since that year. But EU countries leaned heavily on the Libyan coast guard to do so, sending money and boats and a degree of training to units of the loosely organized force linked to various factions of Libya’s militias. For Alpha Kaba, a Guinean detained in slavelike conditions in Libya before ultimately making the crossing in 2016, that decision is a travesty. Kaba was rescued by a ship operated by humanitarian organizations. Those are all but gone now from the Mediterranean, after Italy, Malta and other countries repeatedly refused to allow them to dock with migrants on board. And in the past two years migration has dropped considerably to Europe. The total for the first four months of 2019 was around 24,200 for irregular migration, 27 per cent lower than a year ago, according to Frontex, the EU’s border agency. “Yes, there’s no more migration, but where are all those young people that they picked up? They’re in the prisons. They’re in Libya and in prisons, and they’re being tortured over there. If they aren’t allowed in Europe, then let them go back to their countries quickly and under good conditions,” said Kaba, who has received asylum in France. “There are no more entrances or exits.” Spanish Foreign Minister Josep Borrell said Libya’s migrant holding cells “cannot be referred to as torture detention centres.” Borrell, who is manoeuvring to become the EU’s next foreign policy chief, told reporters in Morocco, “We are trying all means to help Libya provide migrants with the best possible conditions.” Libya’s role in the migrant crisis is already on the radar of the court’s chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda. In a statement to the Security Council in May 2017, she said that her investigators were studying the issue, adding: “I am deeply alarmed by reports that thousands of vulnerable migrants, including women and children, are being held in detention centres across Libya in often inhumane conditions. Crimes, including killings, rapes and torture, are alleged to be commonplace.” The court receives many similar requests every year for formal investigations into war crimes and crimes against humanity. “The more detailed the communication, the more likely the prosecutor will take it seriously,” said Dov Jacobs, a defence lawyer at the ICC who is not connected to the 243-page request. Branco said he believed the details in the report, co-written with lawyer Omer Shatz, would leave the court little choice. “(European officials) pretended that this was a tragedy that nothing could be done against it that they had no role in it,” he said. “And we demonstrate very carefully that, on the contrary, they triggered this so-called tragedy.” "|"Filing blames EU migrant policy for crimes against humanity"|"2019-06-03T09:45:35-0400"|"EU,migrants,Libya,migrant policy,Mediterranean Sea,International Criminal Court,Europe,news,world,crimes against humanity,operation,libya,migration,icc,mediterranean", 
"207"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-sudan-protesters-killed-in-gunfire-as-security-forces-launch-crackdown/"|"Geoffrey York"|"Security forces armed with assault rifles have launched a deadly attack on pro-democracy protesters in Sudan’s capital Khartoum, targeting supporters of a protest site that has remained outside Sudan’s military headquarters for the past two months. At least 35 people have been killed so far in the assault that began at dawn on Monday, according to reports from Khartoum. It was the worst violence since Sudan’s military seized power in a coup in April. Leaders of the pro-democracy movement vowed that the protests will continue. They said their supporters were shutting down Khartoum’s airport as part of a widening strike action to put pressure on the military council that now controls the country. Video clips, posted on social media, showed hundreds of protesters fleeing in terror as sustained bursts of gunfire erupted. In one video, an unarmed protester was shot and injured, falling to the ground after he confronted the attackers. Hospitals in Khartoum were filled with the dead and injured. Photos showed dead bodies on hospital floors, covered in shrouds. In some cases, security forces burst into hospital compounds to pursue the protesters, reports said. There was immediate criticism from Western leaders, who had been urging the military regime to refrain from violence. “Condemn the attack on protesters by Sudanese security forces,” said British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt in a tweet on Monday. “This is an outrageous step that will only lead to more polarization and violence,” he said. “The military council bears full responsibility for this action, and the international community will hold it to account.” The U.S. embassy in Khartoum, in a tweet, said the military council bears responsibility for the attacks. It said the assault on protesters and other civilians “is wrong and must stop.” The military council took control of Sudan in April after ousting the long-ruling president, Omar al-Bashir, in a coup. Military leaders have held weeks of negotiations with pro-democracy leaders on how to move toward civilian rule, but the talks collapsed when the military council insisted on retaining a large amount of control in the planned new government. The street protests began last December, triggered at first by the rising price of bread and fuel in a country gripped by soaring inflation and high unemployment. The protests spread across the country, and by April they were focused on a round-the-clock sit-in outside the military headquarters. The military and police have repeatedly tried and failed to clear away barricades around the site. The attacks on Monday were reportedly led by soldiers, police and a notorious paramilitary group called the Rapid Support Forces, formerly known as the “Janjaweed” when it committed massacres and other atrocities against rebels in the Darfur region of Sudan. The RSF commander, General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, is deputy leader of the military council. He is a close ally of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Last month, on his first international visit since the coup, he travelled to Saudi Arabia and pledged to continue Sudan’s military support for the Saudi Arabian military campaign in Yemen. Pro-democracy protesters fear he has gained Saudi Arabia’s support for a plan to crush the street demonstrations. In Khartoum, as the violent crackdown against protesters continued on Monday afternoon, Sudanese authorities reportedly ordered cellphone companies to halt their mobile internet services, making it more difficult for protesters to communicate. Some services were later restored. A spokesman for the military council denied that the security forces were clearing away the protest camp, saying that the forces were merely trying to disperse “unruly” elements near the sit-in camp area. The military council said early Tuesday it had cancelled all previous agreements with the main opposition coalition and called for snap elections. Lieutenant General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan said in an address that elections would be held within nine months. With files from Reuters.

Trump tweeted on Monday that Russia had told the United States it had removed “most of their people” from Venezuela, where Moscow has maintained close military and economic ties with socialist President Nicolas Maduro. His statement caused a stir because, if true, it would mark a significant setback for Maduro, whom Washington is keen to dislodge and whom the Kremlin has steadfastly stood by. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, however, told reporters that Moscow had not been in touch with Trump on the subject. He said Trump had apparently got his information from newspaper reports, which Russian officials have already denied, or from somewhere else. “By all appearances, it’s a circumstantial reference to newspaper sources of information, because there was no official message about this from the Russian side and there couldn’t be one,” Peskov said of Trump’s statement. “There really are (Russian) specialists who service hardware that’s been previously delivered and that process is going according to plan.” Trump’s tweet followed a Wall Street Journal article on Sunday that said Russian state defence contractor Rostec had cut its staff in Venezuela to just a few dozen, citing a person close to the Russian defence ministry. Rostec said the report had exaggerated the number of staff it had in Venezuela “dozens times over,” that the number of permanent staff there had remained unchanged for years, and that technical staff rotated in and out of the country to repair and service military hardware. It said technical specialists had recently finished servicing a batch of aircraft and that it remained committed to deepening its cooperation with the Venezuelan ministry of defence and honouring its commitments to Caracas. Peskov said on Tuesday that the Kremlin didn’t know what Trump meant when he asserted that Russia had withdrawn some military personnel from Venezuela and had no idea what information he was responding to. “I don’t know what it’s a reaction to, better to find out from the American side,” he said.

"209"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-mounting-climate-change-fears-push-us-investors-to-assess-3/"|"David Randall"|"With an above-average percentage of its power generated from renewable sources and one of the largest battery storage operations in the United States, utility Sempra Energy seemed to check all the boxes for portfolio manager Todd Ahlsten, who manages more than $18 billion for Parnassus Investments based on each company’s environmental, social and governance attributes. But he sold his shares in the San Diego-based company earlier this year because of his conviction that its location in California will put it in the crosshairs of increasingly severe weather patterns, no matter how environmentally responsible it may be. “They were doing all the right things, but the risks were too high on the physical side so we exited the position,” Ahlsten said. Ahlsten’s decision to factor in the geographical risks of climate change is becoming increasingly familiar in the fast-growing world of so-called ESG investing, which has long focused more on avoiding companies with poor environmental track records than assessing which face the greatest risk of physical damage or business disruptions from more volatile climate. The bankruptcy of California utility company Pacific Gas and Electric in January following devastating wildfires caused in part by climate change is prompting investors to recognize what had been one of the biggest blind spots of environmentally driven investing: the reality that even companies that pledge to combat climate change could be negatively affected by it. As a result, ESG investors are increasingly judging companies based on what sort of physical risks they will face as global temperatures continue to rise and storms become more severe. Firms including Parnassus, Hermes Investment Management and Eaton Vance’s Calvert Research and Management are avoiding companies ranging from retailers with large footprints in Florida to utilities in Southern California to barge shipping companies that may have to deal with more frequent Midwestern floods. PG&E faces liabilities that it estimates at over $30 billion in the aftermath of November’s Camp Fire, which killed more than 85 people and destroyed more than 14,600 homes, making it the most destructive wildfire in California history. The risks of physical damage, liabilities or business disruptions from climate change do not currently factor into ESG-ratings by index-providers, which often shape the investable universe for fund managers or exchange-traded funds. “The industry is turning more to try to understand and embed and measure the physical risks associated with climate change, but that’s still an evolving area,” said Tony Campos, head of ESG, Americas, at FTSE Russell. More accurate analytics and modelling programs that help predict the specific impacts of different weather scenarios on individual companies are prompting more fund managers to take the impact of climate change into consideration, said Louise Dudley, portfolio manager of the Federated Hermes Global Equity fund in London. “In terms of physical risk up, until now we’ve looked at the type of companies that are the most exposed. But now with more data we’re able to get more specific, more accurate insights and therefore more useful outputs,” she said. Over the last year, Hermes has spent more time on modelling the likely outcomes for each company it evaluates based on global temperatures rising by 2, 4, or 6 degrees Celsius, she said. Global temperatures are on course to rise between 3 and 5 degrees Celsius (5.4 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of this century, according to a 2018 estimate by the U.N. World Meteorological Organization. Brian Ellis, portfolio manager of the Calvert Bond fund and the Calvert Green Bond fund, said his fund is increasingly focusing on the geographical footprint of companies, ranging from retailers to hotel operators to real estate investment trusts that may be concentrated in areas that could get hit by severe storms or high temperatures. That focus on recognizing which companies may be more likely to bear the physical brunt of climate change is relatively new, he said, and is a step up from crediting companies that had been investing in renewable energy or decreasing their carbon emissions. “I think people are recognizing more so that you can do all that but you can still have very large impacts to your infrastructure” due to more volatile weather patterns, Ellis said. As a result, he is increasingly demanding more enticing potential returns to compensate for the risks of physical damage from climate change, he said.

Police did not reveal a motive for the shotgun attack, but ruled out terrorism. It was Australia’s third mass shooting since the country introduced tough gun laws in response to a 1996 massacre in which a lone gunman armed with two semi-automatic assault rifles killed 35 people in Tasmania state. Mass shootings are usually defined as those resulting in at least four deaths excluding the shooter. In Tuesday’s rampage, four men were killed and a woman was wounded at five places around Darwin, said Northern Territory Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw. The 45-year-old suspect was released from prison on parole in January and was wearing an electronic monitoring bracelet, Kershaw said. Police did not say why he had been in prison or whether the bracelet helped police arrest him. “He is an individual who’s well known to police and has a number of interactions adverse with the police,” Kershaw said. The woman who was wounded did not have serious injuries, he said. The Health Department had earlier said two people were taken to a hospital with gunshot wounds and both were in stable condition. It was not immediately clear if the second victim had been injured in an unrelated shooting. Kershaw said the man was arrested after he contacted a senior police officer. An Australian Broadcasting Corp. reporter said she saw police tackle and taser the gunman at a busy intersection. Kershaw did not explain why the suspect was being held under police guard in a hospital. The suspect had yet to be charged. Northern Territory Chief Minister Michael Gunner described the incident as an “incredibly difficult night.” “This is not the Darwin we know,” Gunner said. “This may be an event you prepare for, but this is never an event you want to respond to.” Witnesses described the shooter using a pump action shotgun to fire multiple blasts at the Palms Hotel and Buffalo Club. A victim was killed at each. Kershaw confirmed that the suspect was armed with a shotgun, but could not confirm what type. Pump action shotguns have been virtually banned from private ownership in Australia along with other rapid-fire weapons under the country’s tough gun laws designed to prevent mass shootings.

"211"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-kim-jong-uns-sister-makes-first-public-appearance-in-more-than-5/"|"Kim Tong-Hyung"|"The powerful younger sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un attended a public event in Pyongyang for the first time in more than 50 days, casting further doubt on media speculation that he had ordered her to lay low over the failed nuclear summit with Washington. North Korea’s state media on Tuesday showed Kim Yo-jong clapping aside her brother, his wife and other top officials at the 150,000-seat May Day Stadium, where thousands of gymnasts, dancers and flip-card-wielding spectators worked in precise unison to perform “The Land of the People.” The official Korean Central News Agency said the performers on Monday showed “beautiful and graceful rhythmic movements, high-spirited gymnastics, interesting national emotion and rich artistic depiction,” but also that Kim Jong-un was quite unhappy about their display. He seriously criticized the creators for their “wrong spirit of creation and irresponsible work attitude” and set forth “important tasks” to correctly implement the country’s revolutionary policy on literature and art, KCNA said. State media often reports on Kim scolding factory officials, educators and others perceived as not performing to his standards. The mass games events were once routine in North Korea but were on hiatus for several years during the mourning for Kim’s father and only returned last year. Kim Yo-jong is a senior official of North Korea’s ruling party and is believed to be her brother’s closest confidant. She had accompanied him to his summits with President Donald Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in and had joined other dignitaries in the stands at last year’s Winter Olympics in South Korea. But speculation about her status grew after she was left out from her brother’s trip to Vladivostok, Russia, in April for a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. North Korean media had last shown her at a meeting of the North’s rubber-stamp parliament on April 12. South Korea’s conservative Chosun Ilbo newspaper last week cited an unidentified source in reporting that Kim Jong-un had ordered his sister to lay low following the collapse of his summit with Trump in February over what the Americans described as excessive North Korean demands for sanctions relief in exchange for only a partial surrender of its nuclear capabilities. The newspaper also reported that Kim had punished his former top nuclear envoy, Kim Yong-chol, who North Korean media showed at the mass games and at a weekend concert of military wives. Senior envoy Kim Hyok-chol, who the Chosun reported had been executed along with four Foreign Ministry officials for betrayal, has not been seen by the media since the end of the Trump-Kim summit in Hanoi, Vietnam, in February. Nuclear negotiations have been at a standstill since the summit’s collapse and Kim in recent weeks has dialled up pressure on Washington by resuming weapons tests and setting an end-of-year deadline for the Trump administration to offer mutually acceptable terms for a deal to salvage the diplomacy. Kim and Trump initially met in Singapore last June, signing a vague statement on improved bilateral relations and a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula without describing how or when it would occur. In a statement issued Tuesday by an unidentified foreign ministry spokesman, North Korea accused the United States of betraying the Singapore agreement and causing the breakdown in Hanoi by demanding that the North unilaterally surrender its nuclear weapons. The spokesman called for the United States to change its “current method of calculation” and warned there was a limit to the North’s patience. “At the second DPRK-U.S. summit talks held in Hanoi amid the great interest and expectation of the entire world, the United States made the biggest mistake of having missed a lifetime opportunity by insisting on ‘dismantlement of the nuke first,“’ the statement said, referring to North Korea by its formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. “This overshadows the future of the DPRK-U.S. talks.” South Korea’s government and media have a mixed record on tracking developments among North Korea’s ruling elite, made difficult by Pyongyang’s stringent control of information about them. Although North Korea has previously banished or executed scapegoats to atone for major political flops, experts doubted the recent reports, saying such extreme punishments were unlikely unless Kim Jong-un was abandoning negotiations with the United States. Cheong Seong-Chang, an analyst at South Korea’s Sejong Institute, said Kim Yo-jong would not have been seen at the Supreme People’s Assembly meeting in April had she been disciplined over the summit failure. Cheong said it’s more likely she was reappearing after a period of rest.

"212"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-airline-conflict-alert-system-remains-patchy-five-years-after-mh1/"|"Jamie Freed Allison Lampert"|"When Pakistan closed its airspace during conflict with India in February, Malaysia Airlines was not one of the carriers left scrambling to reroute flights because it had already done so two weeks earlier, the carrier’s chief executive said. Nearly five years after Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 was shot down by a missile over Ukraine, killing all 298 people on board, carriers like Malaysia Airlines are increasingly taking steps to uncover any threats to their planes. But concerns persist over inadequate government intelligence sharing and a reluctance by countries involved in conflict to divulge information or sacrifice overflight fees by shutting their skies, safety experts said. “The wound is still here in the whole organization and we take safety very seriously,” Malaysia Airlines chief executive Izham Ismail told Reuters on the sidelines of an International Air Transport Association (IATA) conference in Seoul. In the aftermath of the shooting down of MH17, the aviation industry backed the creation by a UN agency of a conflict zone website as a one-stop repository for route planning. But when the site was later closed after complaints from some countries over information-sharing, airlines turned elsewhere for advice. “For the big 50 airlines, they have the resources to dedicate a security department to the job,” said Mark Zee, founder of OPSGROUP, which launched the free website Safe Airspace to provide guidance after MH17. “For everyone else – and that is thousands of operators, I can tell you that many of them have a really hard time making a decent risk assessment. I see it in the emails we get every day.” Airlines are spending millions of dollars a year on extra fuel flying roundabout routes in the Middle East and Africa to avoid conflict zones. And carriers still see routes above war-torn countries differently, just like before MH17, when British Airways and Air France avoided eastern Ukraine, but Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines flew over it. “This is where we need better information,” IATA Senior Vice President, Safety and Flight Operations Gilberto Lopez-Meyer said in Seoul. Qatar Airways, for one, recently returned to flying over Syria as part of its efforts to grapple with a two-year Gulf dispute that has blocked it from using the airspace of many of its neighbours. CEO Akbar al-Baker said the airline would not fly anywhere that is not safe. The United States and other countries ban their airlines from flying over Syrian airspace at any altitude due to safety risks, according to a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) conflict zone website set up after MH17. Yet the resources that are available to airlines often communicate changing threat levels too slowly and informally to be of use, according to the Dutch Safety Board, which led the MH17 investigation and released post-crash recommendations in February this year. While the Netherlands shares confidential information on threats to its own carriers on a formal basis, other countries remain reluctant to do so. The site set up after MH17 by the UN’s International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) closed after “states objected to anybody but themselves publishing information about hazards in their airspace,” said a source involved with the creation of the site who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter. Instead, the use of commercial services like OPSGROUP grew among airlines polled after MH17, the Dutch Safety Board said. “I think after MH17 people became more aware of the problem. They seek information,” said Mohammed Aziz, a former Lebanese air accident investigator who is now a consultant with Aviation Strategies International. “The problem is before they weren’t seeking information. They were waiting for information to come their way.” Montreal-based ICAO has also called for air traffic service authorities to report conflict zone hazards in notices to pilots. But these new requirements do not take effect until November 2020 and still put the onus on countries to share information. “Rules alone do not change the behaviour of states,” said Jeff Poole, director general of the Civil Air Services Navigation Organization (CANSO). “However, we see that more and more states take the correct responsibility.” "|"Airline conflict alert system remains patchy five years after MH17 downing"|"2019-06-04T11:58:00-0400"|"Malaysia Airlines,MH17,MH17 downing,Ukraine,Russia,airline conflict alert system,aerospace,IATA,news,world,information,airspace,site,carrier,conflict",

Yesterday, stunned tourists stood on their balconies smoking cigarettes and watching tanks run right past the hotel. They were kept up all night by machine-gun fire. Yesterday morning, they saw soldiers deliberately fire into the backs of fleeing crowds. "They are crazy, absolutely crazy," shrieked a French tourist watching in horror. Life goes on. Yesterday, after the army staged a full-scale military assault on Tiananmen to clear it of student protesters, hotel guests awoke to find the dining room serving only coffee. Some people made a fuss. The cook, a man in his late 30s, came out of the kitchen crying. "I've seen too many people killed last night," he said, his shaking hand resting on the doorknob. A floor attendant showed a guest to her room. He was also crying. "Why is the army shooting people?" he asked. Saturday night, police at the door frisked anyone who looked like a foreign correspondent. They seized film and videotapes. The hotel also locked its outer gates, forcing guests to hop over the metre-high fence. By 3 a.m., they locked everyone in. It was just as well, as the troops outside started shooting in earnest. The hotel is within firing range. Melissa Ennen, a professor of social studies in New York, decided to get down off the roof after a bullet smashed into the neon light next to her. A U.S. tourist standing on his balcony was nicked in the neck by a ricocheting bullet. From the higher floors of the hotel, there is a clear view of the Avenue of Eternal Peace, and part of Tiananmen Square. This is what the view to a kill looked like. 1 a.m. Armored personnel carrier, sounding as loud as a freight train, drives right over a barricade fashioned from an iron fence. 1:04 a.m. Crowds halt the armored carrier in its tracks. 1:18 a.m. Crowds set armored carrier on fire. Two soldiers inside are rescued by student demonstrators. 1:20 a.m. The first gunfire shot, somewhere south of the square. 2:10 a.m. Troops visible on the east side of the square. 2:15 a.m. Much heavier gunfire. 2:16 a.m. Mass panic. Another armored personnel carrier set on fire in front of the Central Committee headquarters. 2:20 a.m. Five ambulances race by. 2:23 a.m. Tanks rumble into square. A lone cyclist tries to race beside one. Truckloads of troops roar by, with soldiers firing indiscriminately at the crowds. Pandemonium. 2:35 a.m. Intense gunfire. A row of soldiers, about 120 abreast, marches across the square, firing at the crowds. Tens of thousands of people run screaming toward the hotel. Some hop over the fence but are turned away at the door. 2:48 a.m. Soldiers have cleared huge swath in the square. 3 a.m. Pedicab furiously peddles past, a wounded man in the back. 3:07 a.m. Shooting right in the square. 3:12 a.m. Heavy gunfire; another mass stampede. More volunteer pedicabs race by with wounded. Other cyclists help clear a path. 3:30 a.m. Crowds try to push buses across the Avenue of Eternal Peace to form a barricade. They fail. 3:45 a.m. Heavy gunfire to the south and east. Another stampede. People run all the way past the hotel. 4 a.m. The lights suddenly go off in the square. People expect the students to be flattened. Some lights are on in the Great Hall of the People. Are China’s leaders watching? 4:40 a.m. Lights go back on in the square. Loudspeakers order students to clear the square, or face the consequences. 5 a.m. The sky is beginning to lighten. Gunfire in the square. Are the students being shot? 5:23 a.m. Dawn breaks. Huge convoy approaches from the east. People desperately try to make a barricade with buses. There isn’t enough time. About 10 bodies on the ground. People still bicycle toward the square. 6:15 a.m. Angry crowd starts chanting, “Strike, strike!” 6:20 a.m. Eleven armored personnel carriers and 15 more tanks come tearing down the west side of the hotel. Some tanks go right through a barricade formed of three earth-movers. 6:52 a.m. People set fire to a second bus, in front of the hotel. Luckily the wind is right. The thick black smoke blows away from the hotel. 7 a.m. Procession slowly carries five bodies by on stretchers. A person at the front holds a Red Cross flag. 8:15 a.m. Soldiers chase people and fire automatic weapons. 9:15 a.m. People set fire to third bus. 9:30 a.m. Crowd growing. 9:46 a.m. People panic and run toward hotel. 10:09 a.m. One shot fired; thousands flee. 10:22 a.m. Soldiers advance eastward toward hotel, shooting into the backs of the people as they flee. Bullets whiz by the hotel balcony. 10:25 a.m. Shooting stops. Twenty bodies lie on the ground. One cyclist is shot in the back, right in front of the hotel. There are two puddles of blood in the parking lot. 10:55 a.m. People approach gingerly, trying to rescue wounded. Soldiers fire again and send them fleeing. Crowd is outraged. 11:22 a.m. Bodies still there an hour later. No ambulances arrive. 11:48 a.m. Soldiers fire another three-minute volley into crowds. Unclear how many hit. 1:57 p.m. Crowd has returned. Soldiers fire again. Unclear how many hit. People scatter. 3:30 p.m. Crowd has returned. Soldiers fire again. Unclear how many hit. 4:15 p.m. Rain starts, crowd disappears. 7:35 p.m. Crowd has returned. Soldiers fire again. Unclear how many hit. 8:50 p.m. Soldiers shoot into crowd for five minutes. 10:35 p.m. Ten tanks and 10 armored personnel carriers rumble down the Avenue of Eternal Peace, occasionally firing machine guns. They roar up and down the main drag like a motercycle gang on Saturday night, to no apparent purpose. 1 a.m. Streets are deserted. But that is more likely because of the thunderstorm than the tanks. A thunderclap brings tourists scurrying out on their balconies. It sounds like mortar fire. (Return to top)   by Jan Wong (published June 2, 1999) No one died at Tiananmen Square, the Chinese government declared shortly after the 1989 massacre. At the time, everyone scoffed at the Big Lie. After all, hundreds of foreign journalists and millions of Chinese had witnessed the army shooting its way into Beijing. There is footage of soldiers firing in the square. There is film of tanks rolling through the streets. There are pictures of the wounded, the dying and the dead. But there weren't photographs of everything. Did tanks really crush the students? As the years passed, some Chinese began to have doubts. Show us the pictures, they said. Today, The Globe and Mail publishes these pictures, photographic evidence that corroborates oral reports that students were mowed down by tanks on June 4, 1989. "We have pictures," said a caller to my voice mail late Monday afternoon. I called back. We agreed to meet the next day. Yesterday morning, a slender Chinese woman in a navy suit arrived eight minutes early. She pulled four black-and-white photos from her shoulder bag. She also had the negatives. A friend had taken them, she said. She had smuggled them out in 1990, one year after the massacre. Neither she, nor her friend, can be identified. He was a Chinese journalist and remains in Beijing. She is known to be his close friend. She's a Canadian citizen now. Back in 1989, she was a schoolteacher. She went daily to Tiananmen Square, except for that fateful night. Her friend, sensing there would be trouble, told her to go home. But he stayed, huddling with the students in the centre of the square, at the Monument to the People's Heroes. Premier Li Peng had declared martial law on May 19. But Beijing residents, by their sheer numbers, had prevented the army from coming into the city. Now, on the evening of June 3, the troops stormed in from all directions, killing anyone who stood in their way. The first soldiers arrived at Tiananmen Square around 12:50 a.m. June 4. By 4 a.m., they had occupied the square. The terrified students were allowed to leave by the south end. They straggled westward, then north, heading for their campuses. As they turned onto the Avenue of Eternal Peace, they saw a row of tanks. "The students shouted slogans: 'Down with fascism! Down with violence!' " the schoolteacher recalled. "They never dreamed the tanks would come from behind." One tank ran over 11 students, killing seven instantly. I had never understood why more weren't able to escape. The schoolteacher's pictures explain that for the first time. On the far left of one photo, you can see a white iron fence, erected to thwart Beijing's notorious jaywalkers. The students were caught between the tanks and that fence. "The pedestrian barrier prevented them from scattering onto the sidewalk," the schoolteacher said. Her friend was one of the last to leave the square. About half an hour after the students had retreated, he also walked out through the south side, in a wide arc that brought him back to the Avenue of Eternal Peace. That's when he saw the crushed bodies. He happened to have a camera, loaded with black-and-white film from his newspaper. He took a picture with soldiers marching past. He took another, with a tank rolling by. "He said his hands were shaking, but he just did it. The soldiers were shooting people who took pictures," the schoolteacher said. That afternoon, the reporter went to his newspaper. He gave the film to the darkroom technician, a friend, who developed it. Many people saw the photos that day – his fellow reporters, several senior editors. They had all been sympathetic to the students. Then the most senior editor spoke up, according to the schoolteacher. "He said, ‘None of you should say anything about these pictures. Just forget about it.’ " The reporter panicked. The next day, June 5, he slipped out of Beijing with the schoolteacher and two other friends. "The soldiers were still shooting in the street. We felt we were at risk," she said. They fled by train to a distant province where a friend, another journalist, copied the negatives. The originals remain with that friend. The reporter took the copies back to Beijing. Other Chinese took photographs, too. But in the ensuing crackdown, some people destroyed them. Others buried them. The reporter mixed them up with ordinary negatives and kept them at home. In 1990, the schoolteacher obtained a visa to Canada. The reporter decided to give her a few precious negatives. She tucked them in a letter, stuck it in a book and carried it onto the plane. All these years, she has hoped to present them as evidence if Li Peng is ever brought to trial. This week, more than 100 relatives of the dead petitioned Beijing to open a criminal investigation into the massacre. They assert that Li Peng, now the No. 2 leader of the Communist Party and current head of the national parliament, is the primary suspect. Deng Xiaoping, who ordered the army into Beijing, died in 1997. But the schoolteacher is pessimistic that justice will be served. She decided to come forward on the 10th anniversary of the Tiananmen massacre because so many young people question whether it ever happened. "Look at the new generation," she said sadly. "They only believe the government." She also thinks her friend is probably safe. He was fired as a reporter for his pro-democracy ideas and is now a businessman. I never thought to tell her that The Globe would pay for the photos. I called her a few hours later. "I will give the money," the schoolteacher said, "to the people in China who are working to find and help the families of the victims." (Return to top)   by Mark MacKinnon in Beijing (published June 5, 2009) To stand on Tiananmen Square yesterday, surrounded by hundreds of plainclothes security men clutching dainty umbrellas – watching you watching them – was to witness the absurdity of an unreformed police state mixing freely with the confidence of a rising superpower. If they hadn't all worn matching red pins on their lapels, the agents, almost all of them male, might almost have passed for businessmen in their golf shirts and sunglasses. But there were other dead giveaways too: Some wore walkie-talkies on their hips, others had tiny earpieces. At the sight of a foreign journalist – or anyone they thought was behaving suspiciously at all – they'd rush into action, demanding identification and using their umbrellas to interfere with photographers taking pictures of a square that is open to the public nearly 365 days a year. Amid such covert-but-obvious security, none of this country's 1.3 billion citizens dared to so much as lay a flower or light a candle on the square for the hundreds, perhaps thousands, of students, workers and ordinary citizens who were massacred here by their own country's army on June 4, 1989. Foreign journalists were obstructed and harassed, with crowds of umbrella-wielding agents inserting themselves into yesterday's coverage on BBC World and CNN. Dissidents connected with the 1989 uprising, and some who weren't, were this week jailed without charge or placed under house arrest. Several online discussion forums, including both Twitter and its Chinese equivalent, Fanfou, were blocked ahead of the anniversary. While some see the regime's over-the-top crackdown on any hint of dissent as a sign of weakness, it could as easily be interpreted as a display of its strength. Whether you were standing on Tiananmen Square amid the men with umbrellas, or trying to find information on the Internet around the government's Great Firewall, or watching foreign television channels go blank with every mention of the anniversary, you felt the government's presence and its ability to insert itself into your day. In a very unsettling way, it was impressive. For all the economic reforms and social progress of the past two decades, it was the Chinese government's sheer, unreformed authoritarianism that was on display. The same political system the students were protesting against is very much in place – overseen by leaders who inherited power from those who directed the Tiananmen crackdown, still willing to go to extreme lengths to preserve their power. But unlike Deng Xiaoping, who worried the country would collapse if he didn't order his army's tanks and troops to fire on the protesters in 1989, President Hu Jintao and his coterie directed their bloodless crackdown from a position of confidence and strength. Twenty years of economic reforms and rapid progress have created a more content citizenry, most of whom wouldn't have protested even if they could. And the country's rising economic strength has blunted the outside world's willingness and ability to challenge China's rulers about how they treat their subjects. When the United States and other Western countries issued old-fashioned statements about the need for China to repent and confront its ugly past, Mr. Deng's successors made it clearer than ever that they were long past caring what foreign governments think of their political system. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton issued a strong call for China to “examine openly the darker events of its past and provide a public accounting of those killed, detained or missing, both to learn and to heal.” Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon also called on Beijing to account for those who lost their lives in pursuit of democracy. But in a week where a Chinese company emerged as the likely buyer of the iconic Hummer automobile brand, and the world looked to Beijing to solve the spiralling crisis over North Korea's nuclear program – not to mention potentially lead the world out of recession – the words rang empty. Beijing knew it, and responded by effectively telling Ms. Clinton, who had carefully avoided the topic of human rights on her first official visit here earlier this year, that she should know better. “We urge the United States to forsake its prejudices, correct its erroneous ways and avoid obstructing and damaging China-U.S. relations,” Qin Gang, a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry, told a press conference. In other words, the rules of the game have long since changed: ‘We're not the backwards state you could look down your nose at 20 years ago. You need us.' In an effort to remind the world that China is indeed changing, the English-language edition of the state-controlled Global Times newspaper stunned readers yesterday morning with a front-page article that for the first time in years referred to both “the June 4 Tiananmen incident” (though with few details of what happened that day) and the fact the topic remains officially taboo 20 years later. But the article, which highlighted the economic changes over the intervening two decades, was absent from the Chinese-language edition of the same newspaper, and was therefore seen as having limited impact. “The Global Times is speaking to an international audience and endeavouring to convince that audience that this event is already being re-examined. But there's absolutely no evidence in the more important Chinese-language media that anything like that is happening,” said Russell Leigh Moses, a Beijing-based political analyst. “It's a more sophisticated, but no less strident, effort to show the government is not going to back down.” The only crack in Beijing's armour was an astonishing crowd – organizers estimated it at 150,000 people – that turned out for a candlelight vigil in Hong Kong's Victoria Park to mark the Tiananmen anniversary. Hong Kong, a British colony until it was reunited with the mainland in 1997, remains the only part of China where free speech is guaranteed and dissent is largely tolerated. “This rally will tell the world … that we still remember the Tiananmen Square democracy movement,” said Xiong Yan, one of the student leaders of the 1989 protests. Beijing, however, seemed unconcerned. Mr. Qin, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, made it clear that the government has long since moved on, and doesn’t plan to look back. “Today is like any other day. Stable.” (Return to top)   For China’s elite students, Tiananmen is a dangerous topic – scrubbed from memory by patriotic education In 1989, China extinguished Tiananmen’s protests – but lit the spark for a religious revival Editorial: You can’t read this editorial in China "|"‘Why is the army shooting people?’ Tiananmen in 1989, 1999 and 2009, as seen by The Globe"|"2019-06-04T09:02:15-0400"|"tiananmen square,tiananmen massacre,tiananmen anniversary,tiananmen 30th anniversary,tiananmen globe and mail,tiananmen jan wong,tiananmen mark mackinnon,people,beijing,friend,hotel,square,schoolteacher,reporter,government",

The rare shooting, in which the gunman used a motorcycle to move around, opening fire on police and army vehicles, shook the predominantly Sunni Muslim coastal city on the eve of the Eid al-Fitr holiday, which marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan. Interior Minister Raya El Hassan told reporters that the gunman, identified as Abdul-Rahman Mabsout, is a former member of the Islamic State group and now a “lone wolf.” She said the situation was under control. The shooting began late Monday with Mabsout first firing at a branch of the Lebanese Central Bank, then driving around, shooting at police and later at an army vehicle, killing four. With police in hot pursuit, opening fire and using tear gas, Mabsout then drove to a residential building, where he shot his way up the stairs and into an empty apartment on the fourth floor and barricaded himself inside. An hours-long standoff ensued, culminating with security forces storming the apartment. Cornered, Mabsout detonated his explosives vest, killing himself instantly. On Tuesday, there were multiple signs of battle. At least four civilian cars and one police car were heavily damaged, their windshields smashed and pocked by bullet holes. Military police and forensics removed bullets from the street. Tear gas canisters were still on the ground. The nine-floor apartment building where Mabsout died was shell pocked and the apartment itself partially destroyed. Mabsout left a message, apparently for the apartment’s owner, on a mirror. “Forgive me my Muslim brother. ... God willing. I love you in God, I didn’t mean it.” The owner of the apartment said he and his family were not in the house when the gunman stormed the building, but that his flat was left largely destroyed by the explosion. He said the attacker entered his building after shooting one person in the street. “Thank God there was nobody in the house, and my door is not made of steel, it is a wooden door so I think he broke the door and he walked in,” Kamal Ferri told The Associated Press. Mabsout is a former member of the Islamic State group who fought with the extremist movement in Syria. He had been detained when he returned to Lebanon in 2016 and was released a year later. The attack occurred on the eve of Eid el-Fitr, the feast that marks the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan of fasting. The Lebanese army announced earlier that it has increased security around the country because of the holiday, when people go out to celebrate. Tripoli, which is Lebanon’s second largest city, has in the past sen clashes between rival groups that support or oppose the Syrian government of President Bashar Assad. The city is also home to some extremists who fought against the Lebanese army in the past. The Islamic State group and al-Qaida-linked militants have claimed responsibility over the past years for attacks in different parts of Lebanon that killed dozens of people. Such attacks have been rare recently.

The accord came a day after Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte threatened to quit unless the two parties stopped their constant feuding which pushed the government to the edge of collapse just a year after it was formed. Spurred on by Conte’s ultimatum, the leaders of the League and 5-Star, Matteo Salvini and Luigi Di Maio, spoke by telephone for the first time in weeks, looking to bring an end to the mutual recriminations and public dissent. “The return to dialogue is a good sign,” Conte’s office said in a brief statement. Di Maio later called the public tender deal a “common sense” agreement struck in the interests of political stability. “In coming days it will be important to work at full capacity,” Di Maio told reporters. “The moment has arrived to give the country stability.” Relations between the two coalition parties deteriorated dramatically in the buildup to last month’s EU parliamentary election, which saw the League become Italy’s most popular party while the 5-Star lost half its support in barely a year. Since the vote, the League’s Salvini has been behaving as the de facto prime minister, promising major tax cuts and demanding changes to European Union budget rules that impose limits on the debt and deficits run up by governments. The deal on public work contracts was the first sign that the two parties were willing to forge ahead with their often troubled partnership. “You see, we have survived another day,” said a youthful 5-Star parliamentarian after the accord was announced. League politicians had criticized the current tender code, which is hugely complex in an effort to shut out mafia businesses, as a hindrance to the lacklustre economy and demanded it be suspended for two years. 5-Star rejected the proposal as “stupid” and Transport Minister Danilo Toninelli accused the League of wanting to use the dispute as a pretext to bring down the government. In the end, the two parties agreed to a freezing of certain, unspecified parts of the regulations. Many other disputes still need to be resolved between the two parties – including Salvini’s demand that Italy ignore EU deficit and debt rules as he seeks resources to pay for ambitious tax cut plans. The European Commission is likely to begin disciplinary procedures against Italy on Wednesday over its failure to reduce public debt. Speaking to reporters on Monday, Conte said Italy would have to respect EU fiscal rules until it managed to change them, effectively telling Salvini that Rome could not afford the spending splurges he has promised voters. Salvini told supporters on Monday evening that last month’s EU vote had shown that Italians wanted to break with EU rules. “If I realize after a couple of weeks that we are still saying the same things, with the same delays and the same postponements, then we would have a problem,” Salvini told RTL radio on Tuesday ahead of his call to Di Maio.

During a joint news conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday, Mr. Trump offered a ringing endorsement of Brexit and said the United States was eager to strike a trade deal with Britain once it was outside of the European Union. “This is a great, great country and it wants its own identity, it wants to have its own borders, it wants to run its own affairs,” Mr. Trump said when asked about Brexit. “I would think that [Brexit] will happen and it probably should happen.” Mr. Trump went on to suggest that the future of the National Health Service, or NHS, would be up for negotiation. “I think everything with a trade deal is on the table. When you are dealing on trade everything is on the table, so NHS or anything else, a lot more than that, but everything will be on the table. Absolutely,” he said. In Photos: Pageantry, policy and protests: Donald Trump's state visit to the UK Opinion: Before sneering at Trump, Britons should take a long, hard look in the mirror Later Tuesday, however, Mr. Trump said he did not see the NHS as falling under the realm of trade. “I don’t see it being on the table. Somebody asked me a question today and I say everything is up for negotiation, because everything is,” the President said in an interview broadcast on ITV News. “That’s something that I would not consider part of trade. That’s not trade.” The fate of the NHS after Brexit is a sensitive topic in Britain, where access to public health care is considered sacrosanct. Once Britain leaves the EU, the British government will be free to negotiate trade deals with other countries and there are fears the NHS could be opened up to private players. Teams of negotiators from the United States and Britain have been discussing a possible trade deal, but British officials said Tuesday that those discussions were in the early stages and nothing could be signed until after Britain left the EU, which is now slated for Oct. 31. Ms. May had offered a careful response to Mr. Trump’s comments, telling reporters that “both sides negotiate and come to an agreement about what should or should not be in that trade deal for the future.” However, she is stepping down as Conservative Party Leader on Friday and a new leader will take over as prime minister next month. Several leadership candidates were quick to shoot down Mr. Trump’s suggestion. “Dear Mr President. The NHS isn’t on the table in trade talks – and never will be. Not on my watch,” one of the leadership hopefuls, Health Secretary Matt Hancock, said on Twitter. “I want to see the U.K. get fair deals on trade with the U.S. and many other countries when we leave the EU. But the NHS is not for sale to any country and never would be if I was Prime Minister,” added Dominic Raab, a former Brexit secretary who is also running for leader. Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn blasted Mr. Trump and criticized Ms. May for not standing up to the President. “They all need to understand: our NHS is not for sale,” Mr. Corbyn said on Twitter. Mr. Trump is in the midst of a state visit to Britain that began Monday with a series of events at Buckingham Palace. Tuesday’s news conference came after an hour-long meeting with Ms. May and her officials at No. 10 Downing Street. The leaders covered a range of issues, including whether Britain will allow Chinese telecommunication giant Huawei to play a role in the development of the country’s 5G network. Mr. Trump has been urging allies to cut ties with Huawei over concerns the company could share information with the Chinese government. Britain has yet to make a decision on Huawei and officials said a review is under way. Mr. Trump offered effusive praise to Ms. May, the Queen and Britons in general. He called the Queen “fantastic” and said Ms. May had been “a tremendous professional” who didn’t get enough credit for trying to reach a Brexit deal with the EU. His only sharp words were reserved for London Mayor Sadiq Khan and Mr. Corbyn, who he said were “negative forces.” And while he fit in time on Tuesday to chat with some of the candidates aiming to replace Ms. May – notably former foreign secretary Boris Johnson and Environment Secretary Michael Gove – Mr. Trump kept his comments about them low key and shied away from a strong endorsement. He also brushed aside thousands of noisy protesters who flooded central London Tuesday and flew a giant balloon depicting him as a baby in a diaper. The public had welcomed him with open arms, he insisted, in a “tremendous spirit of love.” “I said where are the protests? I don’t see any protests. I did see a small protest today when I came, very small, so a lot of it is fake news, I hate to say it.” With a report from Reuters "|"‘That’s not trade’: Trump backpedals on British health care remarks after backlash"|"2019-06-04T15:33:31-0400"|"Donald Trump,Brexit,Brexit deal,Post-Brexit trade deal,U.S.-Britain trade,Theresa May,NHS,Jeremy Corbyn,news,world,Trump state visit,britain,table,everything,brexit",

Iran and the United States have been drawn into starker confrontation in the past month, a year after Washington pulled out of a deal between Iran and global powers to curb Tehran’s nuclear program in return for lifting international sanctions. Trump has condemned the nuclear deal, signed by his predecessor Barack Obama, as flawed for not being permanent and for not covering Iran’s ballistic missile program and its role in conflicts around the Middle East. He has called on Iran to come to negotiating table to reach a new deal. Trump said last week that Iran “has a chance to be a great country, with the same leadership. We’re not looking for regime change. I just want to make that clear. We’re looking for no nuclear weapons.” Reacting to those comments, Khamenei said in a speech broadcast on state television: “The U.S. president recently said Iran can achieve development with its current leaders. That means they do not seek regime change … But this political trick will not deceive Iranian officials and the Iranian nation.” “In the missile program, they know we have reached a point of deterrence and stability. They want to deprive us from it, but they will never succeed,” Khamenei said, speaking at a ceremony marking the 30th anniversary of the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Khamenei said U.S. sanctions have created hardship for Iranians and called on the government to make improving economic conditions its top priority. President Hassan Rouhani, who has taken a softer stance, suggested last week that Iran might be willing to hold talks if the United States showed it respect and lifted sanctions. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday the United States was prepared to engage with Iran without preconditions about its nuclear program. Iran dismissed the offer as “wordplay”.

The National Health Service (NHS) is a cherished institution for many Britons. Created after World War Two, it provides a wide range of services ranging from routine consultations to life-saving operations. “I think everything with a trade deal is on the table,” Trump told reporters during a visit to London. “So NHS or anything else, or a lot more than that. But everything will be on the table, absolutely.” Later, however, he said that while nothing would be off the table in talks, he did not see the NHS as falling under the realm of trade. “I don’t see it being on the table.

The NHS isn’t on the table in trade talks – and never will be. Not on my watch,” Hancock, who is a contender to replace May as prime minister, said on Twitter.

"221"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-anniversary-of-tiananmen-square-crackdown-draws-silence-in-beijing/"|"Steven Chase Nathan VanderKlippe Robert Fife"|"Ottawa used the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre to urge Beijing to reveal how many Chinese citizens were killed and imprisoned in the crackdown on demonstrating students that shook the world in 1989. “Canada asks Chinese authorities to break the silence on these events by openly accounting for the Chinese citizens who were killed, detained or went missing,” Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said in a statement released Tuesday, three decades after Chinese troops attacked students and civilians in Beijing, mowing them down with automatic weapons or crushing them with tanks. “Canadians join others around the world in commemorating the 30th anniversary of the violent crackdown against unarmed and peaceful citizens in and around Beijing’s Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989,” Ms. Freeland said. China has never provided a death toll for the 1989 violence. Rights groups and witnesses say it could run into the thousands. The Chinese embassy in Ottawa issued a strongly worded condemnation of Ms. Freeland’s statement, saying she made “gross accusations on China’s human rights and religious situation.” The embassy said the Canadian government has flagrantly interfered in China’s internal affairs and trampled on the norms of international relations. “The Chinese side firmly opposes it and has made stern representations to the Canadian side. Any attempt to interfere in China’s internal affairs or destabilize our country is doomed to fail,” the embassy said. Beijing’s success in rejecting foreign criticism of its conduct 30 years ago was perhaps most evident in the heart of the capital Tuesday, where crowds began to gather at Tiananmen Square in the early hours, as they do every day. But the people who came showed no obvious sign of assembling to commemorate those who died here. Instead they came bearing selfie sticks, bright red ball caps and bags of deep-fried dough sticks – tourists from across the country who raised their arms for smiling pictures, mimicking the gesture made famous by Chairman Mao Zedong. Others joined a lengthy queue to gaze in reverence at his preserved body in an adjacent mausoleum. One tourist from Shaanxi province, nearly 1,000 kilometres away, when asked what the crowd would be commemorating on this day, said he did not know. “What happened 30 years ago?” a reporter suggested. “You mean, to commemorate 70 years,” he responded. It’s a reference to the anniversary of the founding of Communist China in 1949, an event that will be marked with much fanfare in October. The events of 1989 – the student protests across the country, the sudden appearance of critical reporting on state media, the grisly end to it all – received no such attention on Tuesday in China. Marks of quiet remembrance circulated between friends using coded language on chat apps. But internet searches for June 4, 1989, and related terms yielded no information. Censors blocked CNN’s website, while Reuters articles about Tiananmen were purged from financial terminals. Police acted weeks ago to place former student protesters and other activists under house arrest, keeping them from making public displays. Ms. Freeland’s comments come as Canada-China diplomatic relations are at a “freezing point," as Beijing’s envoy to Ottawa recently phrased it. This follows Canada’s arrest of a senior Huawei Technologies executive after an extradition request from the United States and the arrest of two Canadians by Beijing for allegedly violating China’s national security. China has also banned imports of Canadian canola and other farm products. The Foreign Affairs Minister’s statement is the strongest on the anniversary of Tiananmen Square by Canada since Stephen Harper was prime minister. That’s because of the inclusion of the call for Beijing to account for the numbers of killed, detained or missing. Former Conservative foreign affairs minister Rob Nicholson urged the same in 2015. Ms. Freeland’s declaration fell short of the U.S. statement on the Tiananmen anniversary. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said hopes of China becoming a more open and tolerant society “have been dashed.” He added that “China’s one-party state tolerates no dissent and abuses human rights whenever it serves its interests.” The European Union said it “continues to mourn the victims and offers its condolences to their families.” David Mulroney, a former ambassador to China, said he welcomes Canada’s statement but said Ottawa should also use the occasion to speak up about specific abuses in China, such as the mass detention of as many as one million Chinese Uyghurs, who are mostly Muslim. “I am happy to see a statement … but it’s useful to update it because China isn’t staying the same and in many ways it’s getting worse,” he said. “The country that 30 years ago shot its own students is now in the process of rounding up and detaining and destroying the culture of a whole minority people within China." The United States also used its statement to criticize Beijing over the treatment of Uyghurs in Xinjiang province. China’s Foreign Ministry rebuked critics, accusing Mr. Pompeo of “lunatic words and idiotic nonsense” and the European Union of making groundless accusations while interfering in China’s internal affairs. “The development path China has chosen is totally correct and is firmly supported by public,” spokesman Geng Shuang said Tuesday. Ms. Freeland said that 30 years after Tiananmen Square, “the struggle for basic freedoms continues for human-rights defenders in China, including lawyers and journalists.” She said that “under the Chinese constitution, Chinese citizens should enjoy freedom of speech, assembly, association and belief. Canada supports these fundamental human rights and stands with all those prevented from exercising their rights." Foreign criticisms were kept from Chinese audiences, as were a pair of unusual official mentions of Tiananmen history. On Sunday, Defence Minister Wei Fenghe told a Singapore audience that China’s measures to stop the “political turbulence” were the “correct policy,” saying “China has enjoyed stability and development” as a result. On Monday, the Global Times, a Communist Party-owned newspaper, published an English-language editorial that called the bloody suppression of the protests a “vaccination for the Chinese society” that “will greatly increase China’s immunity against any major political turmoil in the future.” On Tuesday, the only visible sign of something unusual stood on the streets around Tiananmen Square, where men in shirtsleeves kept watch. A taxi driver said they were plainclothes police. In China, few “even realize this is a day that should be remembered,” said Louisa Lim, author of The People’s Republic of Amnesia: Tiananmen Revisited. Those who do remember “have been so cowed into submission by very visible punishment of acts of remembrance that people don’t dare any more.” The force of forgetting is profound. Earl Drake, Canada’s ambassador to China in 1989, now lives in Vancouver, where he hangs on his wall an enlargement of a picture of an unknown man standing in front of a line of tanks. But when young Chinese people have come to his home, they often stare blankly at the image, even though they are university students in a country with open internet. “They look at this picture and they say, ‘What is this?’ They have no idea about that picture or what it’s about,” Mr. Drake said. Yet even at Tiananmen Square, a place rigorously policed to prevent any act of remembrance, police blocked numerous journalists from entering. The Globe and Mail was briefly detained and told not to publish photos and a few people whispered that they knew the importance of the date. “A major event took place on this day in the past,” one man said.

"222"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-former-german-nurse-accused-of-killing-100-patients-apologizes-to/"|"David Rising"|"A former nurse on trial on allegations he killed 100 patients at two hospitals in northern Germany apologized to his victims’ relatives in a final statement to the court Wednesday, saying he realized how much pain and suffering he had caused with his “terrible deeds.” “To each and every one of you I sincerely apologize for all that I have done,” Niels Hoegel, 42, told the Oldenburg regional court after his defence attorneys had made their closing arguments, according to the dpa news agency. His defence attorneys argued for acquittals in 31 of the 100 counts of murder against him, suggesting there was not enough evidence in those cases. In total, the deaths – which took place at a hospital in Oldenburg between 1999 and 2002 and another hospital in nearby Delmenhorst from 2003 to 2005 – are thought to be the largest string of serial killings in postwar Germany. Hoegel’s alleged victims ranged in age between 34 and 96. “Neither we nor Mr. Hoegel deny that he is the perpetrator in many cases,” one of his defenders, Ulrike Baumann told the court. “But he can only be convicted for crimes he committed and not for crimes he could have committed.” Hoegel was convicted in 2015 of two murders and two attempted murders. He said at his first trial that he intentionally brought about cardiac crises in some 90 patients in Delmenhorst because he enjoyed the feeling of being able to resuscitate them. He later told investigators that he also killed patients in Oldenburg. Authorities subsequently investigated hundreds of deaths, exhuming bodies of former patients. Pleas are not entered in the German legal system but during the seven-month trial, Hoegel admitted to 43 of the killings, disputed five and said he couldn’t remember the other 52. Both the defence team and prosecutors have asked for a sentence of life in prison, but prosecutors have also asked the court to recognize the “particular seriousness of the crime,” making it likely he’d have to serve more than the standard 15-year sentence. Prosecutors are asking for a conviction on 97 counts of murder, saying that in three cases insufficient evidence was presented. During the trial, Hoegel testified that he had a “protected” childhood, free of violence. He said his grandmother and his father, who were both nurses, had been his role models for going into the profession. “Now I sit here fully convinced that I want to give every relative an answer,” Hoegel said during the trial. “I am really sorry.” But Christian Marbach, a spokesman for the affected families whose grandfather was among the victims, doubted Hoegel’s sincerity. “Hoegel is and remains a liar,” Marbach said. “He tactically only admitted what could already 100 per cent be proven against him.” A verdict is expected on Thursday.

"223"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-rescue-helicopter-unable-to-reach-five-bodies-spotted-on-himalayan/"|"Emily Schmall"|"Indian officials on Wednesday were reconsidering a plan to retrieve five bodies believed to be members of a team of international climbers that went missing on a notoriously dangerous Himalayan mountain that a rescue helicopter was unable to reach. All eight of the climbers who disappeared May 26 on Nanda Devi East are presumed dead, and the five bodies photographed by air Monday are thought to be from the missing expedition, said Vijay Kumar Jogdande, an official in Uttarakhand state, where the mountain is located. The mountaineers, led by veteran British climber Martin Moran, had set out to reach the top of an unclimbed, unnamed 6,477-metre ridge, but lost contact with their base camp after an avalanche swept through a section of the mountain. Nanda Devi East is a twin peak of Nanda Devi, India’s second-highest mountain, and the two are connected by a razor-sharp 2-kilometre ridge at an elevation of 6,666 metres. Indo-Tibetan Border Police, who are responsible for rescues in the range where the peaks are located, called off the operation because of the high elevation, which a helicopter was unable to reach after three attempts, spokesman Vivek Pandey said. Officials had devised a plan to use helicopters and a ground team to retrieve the bodies, spotted at an altitude of 5,000 metres, and to search for the three other mountaineers. Pandey said the rescue team returned to the town of Pithoragarh on Wednesday afternoon to reconsider its strategy. “It is not feasible to hover in the air and land near the site of the avalanche where bodies can be seen,” according to a status report seen by The Associated Press. The report said the challenges include the “bowl-like” geography of the terrain, wind turbulence and the risk of further avalanches. It recommended an expedition on foot, though it would take the rescuers a week to acclimate first. The mountaineers began their ascent on May 13, according to Moran Mountain, Moran’s Scotland-based company. The team includes four Britons, two Americans, an Australian and an Indian liaison officer. Before attempting to reach the peak of Nanda Devi East, the team had set out to climb the slightly smaller ridge. Maninder Kohli, a mountaineer who runs a trekking company from New Delhi that has taken groups to Nanda Devi East base camp, said the snow level in the Indian Himalayas this year has been abnormally high. “Apparently the walk-up to the base camp alone was a tedious task because of the snow accumulation,” he said. Kohli said the typical route to the peak is along the southeast ridge, which Polish mountaineers used on the first documented ascent in 1939. Moran and another mountaineer made an unsuccessful attempt over an unproven northeastern route in 2015.

"224"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-chinas-ambassador-to-canada-to-leave-post-later-this-month/"|"Nathan VanderKlippe"|"China’s outspoken ambassador to Ottawa is leaving in the midst of the worst diplomatic crisis between the two countries in decades. Lu Shaye, 54, will leave Ottawa later this month, four people with knowledge of his departure confirmed to The Globe and Mail. China’s Foreign Ministry had no immediate comment. A fluent French speaker whose rhetoric has been called “strikingly undiplomatic,” Mr. Lu has been nominated as China’s ambassador to Paris, according to multiple diplomatic sources in Beijing, who were granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Canada, meanwhile, does not have a permanent ambassador to Beijing, following the firing of John McCallum in January. Relations between Canada and China have grown strained following the December arrest in Vancouver of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou and China’s subsequent arrest of two Canadians. Chinese authorities have also blocked imports of a series of Canadian agricultural products – including canola and pork – and stonewalled requests for high-level communications with the Canadian government. As China’s chief representative in Canada, Mr. Lu raised eyebrows – and, occasionally, anger – for his plainspoken speech, a departure from the cautious public comments made by many of his predecessors. He once lashed out at “white supremacy” in Canada. “Ambassador Lu has been a very undiplomatic diplomat,” said Margaret McCuaig-Johnston, a senior fellow with the China Institute at the University of Alberta. “Instead of trying to work with Canada to understand our position, he has bullied us and given us ultimatums. Of course none of that has worked.” In Canada’s China-watching community, Mr. Lu’s posture received widespread condemnation. On the Internet, some used a play on Chinese characters based on the sound of his name to call him “Behaves Wildly Lu.” (Mr. McCallum came in for similar wordplay, receiving the moniker “Sells Out Canada.”) But his posting to France suggests his work has been favourably received in Beijing, which is rewarding him with a promotion to a major European power. “His hard line tone surely pleased people in the Chinese Communist Party, but it did not work well for him here,” said Guy Saint-Jacques, Canada’s former ambassador to China. Mr. Lu delivered high-profile speeches and sat down for numerous media interviews in which he criticized “unjust and unfair” Canadian media coverage of China – including by The Globe – and delivered Beijing’s rebuttal to foreign commentary, often in direct terms. “The reason why some people are used to arrogantly adopting double standards is due to Western egotism and white supremacy,” he wrote in an opinion piece for The Hill Times in January. “What they have been doing is not showing respect for the rule of law, but mocking and trampling the rule of law.” In a speech at an event sponsored by BMO Financial Group and The Globe in late May, he lashed out at allegations that China is “an ’autocracy’ with ’no freedom’ and ’violating human rights.’” Instead, he argued, “China has realized its modernization and become the second largest economy in the world in only a few decades while it took its Western counterparts several hundred years to achieve the same.” In defending Huawei, he has also spoken out against what he called “a stale cold-war mentality” among those who believe “that China – a socialist country led by the Communist Party of China – is an abnormal country. They are worried that China is catching up to Western countries too quickly, and that it will surpass them in terms of the economy as well as science and technology.” In his willingness to attack critics, Mr. Lu adopted language that has been used by a growing number of Chinese diplomats – including, most prominently, Wang Yi, China’s state councillor and Minister of Foreign Affairs. Mr. Wang, in 2016, berated a Canadian journalist for a question he called “full of prejudice against China and arrogance.” Chinese ambassadors in Sweden, South Africa and Britain have been similarly outspoken. “The strikingly undiplomatic Lu Shaye was indeed not an aberration, but is rather a symptom of a Chinese Communist Party that, confident in its status as a major international player, has been in lecturing mode in recent years,” said J. Michael Cole, a senior fellow at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute. “We are increasingly being lectured to by Chinese representatives who will no longer countenance the view that our system – liberal democracy, with rule of law and transparency – is superior to theirs.” Indeed, the rhetoric from China’s diplomatic corps has only served to highlight what Hervé Lemahieu, director of the Asian Power and Diplomacy Program at Australia’s Lowy Institute, calls “the end of the age of tolerance,” between China and the West, and in particular the U.S. ”It could be that they’re trying to intimidate Canada into submission,” he said. “But it’s more likely they’re trying to make an example of Canada to third countries and say, ’this is what happens when you decide to mess with us. And there are consequences to taking the U.S. side on issues.’” It’s not clear who will replace Mr. Lu, or even whether he will be immediately replaced. Canada has yet to select someone to replace Mr. McCallum, and it would make sense for China to “have the same protocol” in Canada, said Cheng Li, director of research and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Still, he warned that it’s not clear any successor to Mr. Lu would adopt a warmer tone. In Mr. Li’s conversations with Chinese diplomats, many are “even more angry” in private than they are in public. There is a widespread sense that foreign criticism of China “is very unfair,” he said.

"225"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-more-than-2-million-people-could-die-of-starvation-in-somalia-amid/"|""|"A United Nations emergency relief co-ordinator says more than 2 million men, women and children could die of starvation in Somalia by summer’s end if international aid is not sent quickly to the drought-stricken African country. UN Undersecretary-General Mark Lowcock says about $700-million is needed after a rainless season that has killed both livestock and crops. He said Tuesday that the UN’s Central Emergency Response Fund has allocated $45-million to cover food shortages, water and daily necessities in Somalia as well as parts of Kenya and Ethiopia affected by droughts. Of a Somali population of 15 million people, more than 3 million are struggling just to meet minimum food requirements, he said, and the shortages are about 40 per cent worse now than this past winter. “What was forecast to be an average rainy season in Somalia is now one of the driest on record in over 35 years,” he said. “Communities that were already vulnerable due to past droughts are again facing severe hunger and water scarcity and are at risk from deadly communicable diseases.” The UN aid complements efforts by governments of the three countries to assist their people, especially those with disabilities or who are internally displaced. Somalia’s humanitarian fund is currently depleted. If financial aid is delayed, the cost of saving lives on the margin of death are much higher, Lowcock said, adding that the option then is to turn to expensive, therapeutic feeding programs. “We could have a quick response now, which would be cheaper, reduce human suffering and more effective, or we can wait for a few months until we get all those horrible pictures on our TV screens and social media of starving kids,” Lowcock said. Lowcock, who heads the UN Office for Humanitarian Affairs, said that in past decades droughts came about every half dozen years but recently they have hit every two or three years. “There’s not really any question in my mind that these more frequent droughts are related to global warming and climate change,” the UN official said. “So the only middle– and longer-term response is to look at alternative livelihoods – a different way to make a living.” "|"More than 2 million people could die of starvation in Somalia amid drought: UN"|"2019-06-05T14:41:16-0400"|"Somalia,Somalia drought,famine,UN,Mark Lowcock,UN’s Central Emergency Response Fund,humanitarian aid,news,world,somalia,lowcock,aid,season,response,people", 
"226"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-perfect-jump-97-year-old-d-day-veteran-parachutes-into-normandy/"|"John Leicester"|"No murderous hails of gunfire this time. No D-Day objective that had to be taken, whatever the cost. This time, 75 years almost to the hour after he parachuted into Nazi-occupied France, Tom Rice again found himself floating down through Normandy’s skies, now a grizzled 97-year-old thrilled as a little kid. “Woo-hoo!” the ex-paratrooper yelped after hitting the ground, carrying the memories of comrades lost in battle and on a new mission – of remembrance this time – for the ever-shrinking numbers who sacrificed so much in the Second World War. “I represent a whole generation,” Rice said. Engines throbbing, C-47 transport planes dropped string after string of parachutists, a couple of hundred in all – including Rice, who jumped strapped to a partner, not alone and laden with weapons as he did on June 6, 1944. “It went perfect, perfect jump,” Rice said after catching his breath. “I feel great. I’d go up and do it all again.” The clouds of jumpers, with round ‘chutes akin to those used by D-Day soldiers, were honouring the thousands of paratroopers who leapt into gunfire and death 75 years ago. Their landing zone Wednesday was fields of wildflowers outside Carentan, one of the targets of the airborne forces that were dropped in darkness on perilous missions to take strategic objectives and disrupt German defences so that the greatest amphibious invasion in history, on the D-Day beaches, would have a greater chance of success. Rice, of San Diego, jumped into roughly the same area he landed in on D-Day. He said it was dark in 1944 when he hit the ground in hostile territory and he can’t be sure exactly where he was. Rice jumped with the U.S. Army’s 101st Airborne Division on that momentous day 75 years ago, landing safely despite catching himself on the exit and a bullet striking his parachute. He called the 1944 jump “the worst jump I ever had.” “I got my left armpit caught in the lower left hand corner of the door so I swung out, came back and hit the side of the aircraft, swung out again and came back, and I just tried to straighten my arm out and I got free,” he told The Associated Press in an interview. His jump on Wednesday was an altogether different story. Still buff and sprightly, and having prepared for six months with a physical trainer, Rice swooped down with an American flag fluttering beneath him and landed to a wave of applause from the crowd of thousands that gathered to watch the aerial display. Other parachutists jumped with Second World War souvenirs, some carrying items their grandfathers took into battle. Many spectators wore war-era uniforms, and music of the time played over loudspeakers. Robert Schaefer, a retired lieutenant colonel with the U.S. Army’s Green Berets who served in Afghanistan, carried whisky, cigars and the dog tag and wallet his grandfather, George J. Ehmet, had with him when he fought as an artillery man in France. “I feel like I got to jump with my grandpa,” Schaefer said afterward. British parachutists jumped later Wednesday en masse over Sannerville. D-Day veterans were expected to be among them. The jumps were part of events marking the 75th anniversary of the D-Day invasion . Asked how his D-Day comrades would have felt about him jumping, Rice said, “They would love it.” “Some of them couldn’t handle it. Many of them are deceased. We had 38 per cent casualties,” he said. Like many other veterans, he said he remains troubled by the war. “All the GIs suffer from same blame and shame,” Rice said. “It bothers us all the time for what we did. We did a lot of destruction, damage. And we chased the Germans out, and coming back here is a matter of closure. You can close the issue now,” he said.

"227"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-raids-on-public-broadcaster-put-australia-in-a-league-of-its-own-among/"|"Damien Cave"|"One journalist is being investigated for reporting that several boats filled with asylum-seekers recently tried to reach Australia from Sri Lanka. Another reporter had her home raided by authorities this week after reporting on a government plan to expand surveillance powers. Then on Wednesday, the Australian federal police showed up at the main public broadcaster with a warrant for notes, story pitches, emails, and even the diaries for entire teams of journalists and senior editors – all in connection with a 2017 article about Australian special forces being investigated over possible war crimes in Afghanistan. The aggressive approach – which Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, has defended – fits with a global trend. Democracies from the United States to the Philippines are increasingly targeting journalists to ferret out leaks, silence critics and punish information sharing – with President Donald Trump leading the verbal charge by calling journalists “the enemy of the people.” Canadian journalists continue to face reporting barriers as global press freedom deteriorates: report Opinion: The silencing of journalists is an attempt to silence us all But even among its peers, Australia stands out. No other developed democracy holds as tight to its secrets, experts say, and the raids are just the latest example of how far the country’s conservative government will go to scare officials and reporters into submission. “To be perfectly frank, this is an absolute international embarrassment,” said Johan Lidberg, an associate professor of journalism at Monash University in Melbourne who works with the United Nations on global press freedom. “You’ve got a mature liberal democracy that pursues and hunts down whistleblowers and tries to kill the messenger.” The symptoms of what Lidberg describes as a national illness go beyond the latest investigations, and the causes are rooted in Australia’s history, law and public complacency. Australia does not have a constitutional protection for freedom of speech. But its criminal code does have Section 70, which makes it a crime for any public official to share information without “lawful authority or excuse.” That “secrecy foundation” – the law cited in the warrant against the Australian Broadcasting Corp., the target of Wednesday’s raids – essentially states that no one in government can share information without a supervisor’s permission. It has been on the books since 1914, just after the outbreak of World War I, and is modelled on Britain’s draconian Official Secrets Act of 1911. Layered on top of that are a wide range of measures and court cases involving privacy – a web of legal restrictions that, among other things, keep trials like the sexual abuse conviction of Cardinal George Pell out of public view. Defamation law adds another hurdle. Sexual assault cases are especially rare in Australia because of the risks to accusers – and to journalists who cover such cases. The journalists who report such accusations can easily be sued (and lose), as Geoffrey Rush’s recent court victory in a defamation case clearly shows. But none of this may be as significant as the squeeze around national security. Since the 9/11 attacks, Australia has passed or amended more than 60 laws related to secrecy, spying and terrorism, according to independent studies. “That’s more than any other mature liberal democracy on the globe,” Lidberg said. “A lot of countries have amended terrorism laws, but none like Australia.” The most recent expansion of governmental secrecy came last year with an espionage bill that increased criminal penalties for sharing information deemed classified, even if a document happened to be as harmless as a cafeteria menu, and broadened the definition of national security to include the country’s economic interests. Even before the law was passed, the broadening of the national security apparatus was causing a stir with a case involving an anonymous whistleblower known only as “Witness K.” An Australian secret intelligence service agent, Witness K revealed Australia’s bugging of East Timor’s cabinet room during sensitive negotiations in 2004 over an oil and gas treaty worth billions of dollars. The whistleblower had his passport seized in 2013 as he was preparing to give evidence at The Hague, and he and his lawyer were charged with conspiracy for violating the Intelligence Services Act for passing on sensitive national security information – even though the spying on a poor regional ally mainly involved business interests. The investigations that emerged this week appear aimed mainly at other current or potential whistleblowers in government. Police have signalled to the journalists involved that they are looking for the leakers who passed on information to reporters, and Morrison said this week that the federal police were simply trying to enforce “clear rules protecting Australia’s national security.” This is a familiar justification, the same one used by the Obama administration in its cases against American journalists. But in Australia’s case, authorities have enormous scope and few checks on their power. The journalist whose home was raided Tuesday, Annika Smethurst of The Sunday Telegraph of Sydney, had authorities rifling through her belongings for more than seven hours. At the Australian Broadcasting Corp. on Wednesday, police downloaded more than 9,000 documents based on a warrant giving them authority to examine phones and notebooks of many journalists that had nothing to do with the articles in question. “No turf, no terrain is off the books,” said Joseph Fernandez, a media law expert at Curtin University in Perth. “The law is very, very wide reaching, and it is very disturbing.” He added that it was hard to imagine how any of these articles could have been construed as a threat to national security rather than simply an embarrassment for officials and politicians. Take the investigation into the revelation about boats with asylum-seekers trying to reach Australia from Sri Lanka. Just a few years ago, the Australian government sent out news releases when smugglers’ boats tried to reach the country, critics noted, but now that the home affairs minister wants to keep such attempts secret, they are considered a threat to national security. Or consider the investigative article about Afghanistan from the Australian Broadcasting Corp., which explored the impact of at least 10 episodes from 2009 to 2013 in which Australian special forces troops shot and killed not just insurgents, but also unarmed men and children. The journalists involved were careful not to identify certain operational details that appeared in the documents they had obtained, and their report mainly highlighted the rift between elite military units and leaders trying to grapple with where to draw the line in grisly combat. Many of the journalists involved have asked why information from so long ago would be a threat to national security now when Australia has only a few hundred troops in Afghanistan playing more minor roles. “What they’re trying to do, I think, is essentially send a message to people doing their job, journalists, that ‘From now on, you’re on notice that anyone you talk to, anyone you have text contact with, any digital footprint at all, we will know about it,’” said John Lyons, the head of investigative journalism at the Australian Broadcasting Corp., who chronicled the raids on Twitter. The risk, he and others added, is that the pressure silences people who have information that serves the public interest. It might be the teacher who sees children abused, or the spy who has evidence of corrupt colleagues. And some say the ripples could be global. “Countries with a much worse track record with freedom of expression and democracy, it gives them a free go,” said Fernandez, a former newspaper editor in Malaysia, where crackdowns on the press have become more common. “Countries who were looked up to for moral authority are the very ones who are now committing the sort of egregious assaults on freedom of expression and democracy itself,” he added. “They have undermined their moral authority.” "|"Raids on public broadcaster put Australia in a league of its own among secretive democracies "|"2019-06-05T16:40:19-0400"|"Australia,Australian Broadcasting Corp.,Scott Morrison,journalists,freedom of speech,national security,secrecy,press freedom,whistle-blowers,democracy,australia,journalist,authority,information,security",

You don’t think you’re going to get killed. The only thing you think is ‘I hope this boat doesn’t get hit here, because I don’t swim very well and it’s too far to go back.' ” He paused and added: “Anybody who tells you they weren’t scared on D-Day, they weren’t on this planet. Because that fear is always there. It’s hard to explain.” D-Day confidential: How four Canadian soldiers made it through their longest day Postcards from the past: Remembering the Canadian soldiers who died in Normandy Mr. Boon was among more than 300 D-Day veterans from Canada, the United States, Britain and a dozen other Allied countries who gathered on Southsea Common on Wednesday for a stirring ceremony to mark the 75th anniversary of the invasion. Most of the preparation for Operation Overlord, as D-Day was known, was done at Southwick House in Portsmouth, and the city’s open fields along the waterfront were key launching points. The veterans were joined by the Queen and a host of world leaders including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, U.S. President Donald Trump, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The ceremony was broadcast on giant screens to thousands of people in a nearby park, cut off from the dignitaries for security reasons. It began with video messages from three veterans, including Canadian Bob Roberts, who was among the first soldiers to land on Juno beach that morning. “I was never brought up for killing people,” Mr. Roberts said in the video. “Thinking back now, I don’t know how I survived it.” The event mixed singing, dancing and readings to tell the story of the buildup to D-Day, touching on everything from the roles of the soldiers, sailors and airmen to the fighters in the French resistance and the women who worked in factories building bombers. There was also a reading from the diary of a German soldier, which captured the terror he felt waiting for the onslaught he knew was coming. One portion of the program covered the failed 1942 raid on Dieppe, France; of the almost 5,000 Canadian soldiers in the operation, 3,400 were killed, wounded or captured. The lessons learned from Dieppe proved critical to the planning of D-Day, which involved more than 130,000 ground troops, including 14,000 Canadians; 7,000 ships; and more than 14,000 aircraft missions. Mr. Trudeau read a passage from the Victoria Cross citation for Lieutenant Colonel Cecil Merritt, who won the medal for his bravery at Dieppe. The citation noted how Lt. Col. Merritt led his unit’s advance through heavy shelling and how he kept fighting despite being wounded twice. “Waving his helmet, Lieutenant-Colonel Merritt rushed forward shouting ‘Come on over! There’s nothing to worry about here,’ ” Mr. Trudeau read from the citation. Mr. Trump, Mr. Macron and British Prime Minister Theresa May also gave readings. Mr. Trump recited Franklin D. Roosevelt’s famous prayer, The Mighty Endeavor, which was delivered in a national radio broadcast the night of the invasion. Mr. Macron read the last letter written by 16-year old Henri Fertet, a resistance fighter who was executed. The French President was also the only leader to veer off script. Before his reading, Mr. Macron offered his thanks to the veterans. Ms. May read a letter from Captain Norman Skinner to his family, which was found in his pocket after he died on Sword Beach on June 6. “My thoughts at this moment, in this lovely Saturday afternoon, are with you all now,” the letter said. The Queen, who served as an army mechanic during the war, spoke about the resilience of the “wartime generation” and said that many people thought her attendance at the 60th anniversary of D-Day would be her last. “I am delighted to be with you in Portsmouth today,” she said. “It is with humility and pleasure, on behalf of the entire country – indeed the whole free world – that I say to you all, thank you.” Near the close of the event, 99-year old British veteran John Jenkins walked on to the platform and offered a D-Day message to the veterans and those who died. “I was terrified, I think everyone was,” he said. “You never forget your comrades. We must never forget.” After the service, Canadian veteran Bill Wilson talked about the frustration he felt about D-Day commemoration ceremonies. Mr. Wilson, 94, was an anti-aircraft gunner on a Canadian destroyer during the D-Day landing. “I think governments feel it’s important to recognize what happened, but the actual event? I don’t think it means anything to people,” he said sitting at a table and watching as Mr. Trudeau shook hands with several veterans. “I don’t think the current generation really cares. … This was an important contribution that Canada made, and Canadians just don’t understand.” Mr. Wilson shook his head and mentioned a school classmate who died on D-Day moments after storming the beach. He said he plans to visit his friend’s grave in France when he heads to another ceremony in Normandy on Thursday. “They say these guys are heroes,” he added, pointing to the other veterans. “The heroes are buried over there [in France]. When those guys landed, they did so for a cause. They didn’t have to.” "|"‘I don’t know how I survived’: D-Day veterans join world leaders in Portsmouth on invasion’s 75th anniversary"|"2019-06-05T14:12:07-0400"|"d-day,portsmouth,75th,anniversary,world war ii,second world war,veterans,trump,trudeau,queen elizabeth,letter,people,citation,dieppe,france", 
"229"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-fiat-chrysler-pulls-out-of-renault-merger/"|"Laurence Frost"|"Fiat Chrysler said on Wednesday it was withdrawing its $35 billion merger offer for Renault, blaming French politics for scuttling what would have been a landmark deal to create the world’s third-biggest automaker. A source close to the French carmaker’s board said Fiat Chrysler made the move after France sought to delay a decision on the deal in order to win the support of Nissan Motor Co , Renault’s Japanese alliance partner. French government officials had pushed for Nissan to support the merger. Nissan had said it would abstain. The French government, which owns a 15 per cent stake in Renault, had also pushed Fiat Chrysler and Renault for guarantees that France would not lose jobs, and for a dividend to be paid to Renault shareholders, including the government, people familiar with the talks said. “It has become clear that the political conditions in France do not currently exist for such a combination to proceed successfully,” Fiat Chrysler said in a statement. Renault, in a separate statement, said its board was “unable to take a decision due to the request expressed by the representatives of the French state to postpone the vote to a later meeting.” The apparent collapse of merger talks leaves the two companies facing an array of issues, starting with the likely dismay of investors who bid up shares in both companies after Fiat Chrysler proposed a merger of equals just over a week ago. Fiat Chrysler had proposed that its shareholders receive a 2.5 billion euro ($2.8 billion) special dividend as part of the merger, had it been completed. The two companies told investors a merger would cut running costs by 5 billion euros ($5.6 billion) or more a year. Fiat Chrysler stood to gain access to Renault’s superior electric drive technology to meet mandates for zero-emission cars. Renault would have had a share of the Italian-American company’s lucrative Jeep sport utility vehicle and RAM pickup truck franchises. It is not clear what the two companies will do next to tackle the costs of far-reaching technological and regulatory changes. Fiat Chrysler had held inconclusive talks with France’s PSA Group, which also has the French government as a shareholder. The sudden end to the merger talks came after midnight in Paris, after Fiat Chrysler and French government officials had reached a tentative agreement that cleared the way for Renault’s board to consider moving forward, people familiar with the situation said. Renault’s previous alliance and cross-shareholding with Japanese automaker Nissan had loomed all along as a potential snag. Nissan Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa met last week with Renault Chief Executive Jean-Dominique Senard, and said he did not see “any particular negative aspect” to the proposed Renault-Fiat Chrysler merger. But people familiar with the situation said Nissan executives were blindsided by the merger proposal. A Nissan spokesman had no immediate comment.

Olsen"|"The Social Democrats emerged as Denmark’s biggest party in elections Wednesday, with preliminary results indicating gains for left-leaning parties and a big loss for populists. If confirmed in final returns, the outcome pointed to the Social Democrats returning to power after four years as the country’s leading opposition party. The Social Democrats got about 25.9 per cent of the votes after a campaign in which party leaders vowed a tough stance against immigration. Mette Frederiksen, the party’s leader, said late Wednesday that the Social Democrats will try to govern as a minority rather than form a governing coalition with smaller parties. It will seek support from the right on some issues, such as immigration, and from the left on other matters, such as social welfare, she said. Although Frederiksen won’t try to form a coalition, other left-leaning parties that increased their vote shares will likely support her effort to form a government to avoid the centre-right from getting a chance. The Social Democrats and other left-of-centre parties appear headed to having one more vote than a majority in the 179-seat parliament, the Folketing. With nearly 100 per cent of the votes counted, the Liberal Party of Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen showed a slight gain from four years ago. But the populist Danish People’s Party, which often voted with the centre-right Liberals, was hit with a big drop in support, meaning Loekke Rasmussen can no longer muster a majority in parliament. The Danish People’s Party’s performance was a contrast to some other European countries, where far-right populists have been on the rise. The party was the second-largest party in the outgoing parliament, but its vote share plunged to about 9% Wednesday, compared to 21.1% in 2015. Loekke Rasmussen conceded defeat and would resign Thursday. “You have chosen that Denmark should have a new majority, that Denmark should take a new direction,” Frederiksen said told a jubilant crowd at parliament. “And you have chosen that Denmark should have a new government.” At age 41, Frederiksen could become Denmark’s youngest-ever prime minister. “The election campaign is now over. It’s time to find solutions,” she said. Many Danish People’s Party voters have drifted to the Social Democrats, mainly because of it readopting tough views on immigration. The party advocated restricting immigrants in the 1980s and 1990s but softened its position later while in a coalition with left-wing parties. Its lawmakers voted for several laws introduced by Loekke Rasmussen’s government to tighten immigration. “This is really, really bad,” People’s Party leader Kristian Thulesen Dahl said of his loss at the polls, but he said the party would not change its politics. The Hardliner Course party didn’t cross the 2 per cent threshold needed to enter Parliament. The New Right, another openly anti-Muslim group that also fielded candidates for the first time, will be in the legislature after getting 2.4% of the votes.

You don’t think you’re going to get killed. The only thing you think is ‘I hope this boat doesn’t get hit here, because I don’t swim very well and it’s too far to go back.' ” He paused and added: “Anybody who tells you they weren’t scared on D-Day, they weren’t on this planet. Because that fear is always there. It’s hard to explain.” D-Day confidential: How four Canadian soldiers made it through their longest day Postcards from the past: Remembering the Canadian soldiers who died in Normandy Mr. Boon was among more than 300 D-Day veterans from Canada, the United States, Britain and a dozen other Allied countries who gathered on Southsea Common on Wednesday for a stirring ceremony to mark the 75th anniversary of the invasion. Most of the preparation for Operation Overlord, as D-Day was known, was done at Southwick House in Portsmouth, and the city’s open fields along the waterfront were key launching points. The veterans were joined by the Queen and a host of world leaders including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, U.S. President Donald Trump, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The ceremony was broadcast on giant screens to thousands of people in a nearby park, cut off from the dignitaries for security reasons. It began with video messages from three veterans, including Canadian Bob Roberts, who was among the first soldiers to land on Juno beach that morning. “I was never brought up for killing people,” Mr. Roberts said in the video. “Thinking back now, I don’t know how I survived it.” The event mixed singing, dancing and readings to tell the story of the buildup to D-Day, touching on everything from the roles of the soldiers, sailors and airmen to the fighters in the French resistance and the women who worked in factories building bombers. There was also a reading from the diary of a German soldier, which captured the terror he felt waiting for the onslaught he knew was coming. One portion of the program covered the failed 1942 raid on Dieppe, France; of the almost 5,000 Canadian soldiers in the operation, 3,400 were killed, wounded or captured. The lessons learned from Dieppe proved critical to the planning of D-Day, which involved more than 130,000 ground troops, including 14,000 Canadians; 7,000 ships; and more than 14,000 aircraft missions. Mr. Trudeau read a passage from the Victoria Cross citation for Lieutenant Colonel Cecil Merritt, who won the medal for his bravery at Dieppe. The citation noted how Lt. Col. Merritt led his unit’s advance through heavy shelling and how he kept fighting despite being wounded twice. “Waving his helmet, Lieutenant-Colonel Merritt rushed forward shouting ‘Come on over! There’s nothing to worry about here,’ ” Mr. Trudeau read from the citation. Mr. Trump, Mr. Macron and British Prime Minister Theresa May also gave readings. Mr. Trump recited Franklin D. Roosevelt’s famous prayer, The Mighty Endeavor, which was delivered in a national radio broadcast the night of the invasion. Mr. Macron read the last letter written by 16-year old Henri Fertet, a resistance fighter who was executed. The French President was also the only leader to veer off script. Before his reading, Mr. Macron offered his thanks to the veterans. Ms. May read a letter from Captain Norman Skinner to his family, which was found in his pocket after he died on Sword Beach on June 6. “My thoughts at this moment, in this lovely Saturday afternoon, are with you all now,” the letter said. The Queen, who served as an army mechanic during the war, spoke about the resilience of the “wartime generation” and said that many people thought her attendance at the 60th anniversary of D-Day would be her last. “I am delighted to be with you in Portsmouth today,” she said. “It is with humility and pleasure, on behalf of the entire country – indeed the whole free world – that I say to you all, thank you.” Near the close of the event, 99-year old British veteran John Jenkins walked on to the platform and offered a D-Day message to the veterans and those who died. “I was terrified, I think everyone was,” he said. “You never forget your comrades. We must never forget.” After the service, Canadian veteran Bill Wilson talked about the frustration he felt about D-Day commemoration ceremonies. Mr. Wilson, 94, was an anti-aircraft gunner on a Canadian destroyer during the D-Day landing. “I think governments feel it’s important to recognize what happened, but the actual event? I don’t think it means anything to people,” he said sitting at a table and watching as Mr. Trudeau shook hands with several veterans. “I don’t think the current generation really cares. … This was an important contribution that Canada made, and Canadians just don’t understand.” Mr. Wilson shook his head and mentioned a school classmate who died on D-Day moments after storming the beach. He said he plans to visit his friend’s grave in France when he heads to another ceremony in Normandy on Thursday. “They say these guys are heroes,” he added, pointing to the other veterans. “The heroes are buried over there [in France]. When those guys landed, they did so for a cause. They didn’t have to.” "|"‘I don’t know how I survived’: D-Day veterans join world leaders in Portsmouth on invasion’s 75th anniversary"|"2019-06-05T14:12:07-0400"|"d-day,portsmouth,75th,anniversary,world war ii,second world war,veterans,trump,trudeau,queen elizabeth,letter,people,citation,dieppe,france", 
"232"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-thailands-parliament-convenes-for-vote-thats-expected-to-keep/"|"Kaweewit Kaewjinda Pitcha Dangprasith"|"Thailand’s Parliament elected 2014 coup leader Prayuth Chan-ocha as prime minister in a vote Wednesday that helps ensure the military’s sustained dominance of politics since the country became a constitutional monarchy nearly nine decades ago. The military-backed party that nominated Prayuth won the second-highest number of seats in the House of Representatives in a general election in March. But his selection was virtually assured because the prime minister is chosen in a joint vote of the 500-seat House and the 250-seat Senate, whose members were appointed by the junta Prayuth leads. Two House seats were vacant due to a suspension and resignation. Prayuth was elected to serve a second term by a vote of 500 to 244 for his opponent, Future Forward party leader Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit. Prayuth, a former army commander, was the candidate of the military-backed Palang Pracharath party, which holds 116 House seats, as well as lawmakers from smaller parties. Prayuth’s appointment becomes official when it is endorsed by King Maha Vajiralongkorn. “The people are still calling for liberties. The people are still calling for justice,” Thanathorn said after the vote. “This is not the time to lose hope. Hope is still on our side. Time is still on our side. I want to thank all 244 people who love democracy for voting for me.” Prayuth made no immediate public comment on the vote. Prayuth did not run for office in the March election — the constitution enacted under the junta he headed does not require that the prime minister come from Parliament. Laws passed under his government handicapped established political parties, raising concerns the election was not held on a level playing field. Critics also questioned the fairness of the Election Commission, alleging that rules were bent after the election to benefit Palang Pracharath. The new election laws were aimed especially at the Pheu Thai party, which headed the government ousted by the 2014 coup and won the most House seats in March. Pheu Thai is associated with former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was removed by a 2006 coup and lives in exile to avoid serving a prison term on a conflict of interest conviction he decries as politically motivated. The populist policies of Thaksin won him enormous support at the polls but also threatened the influence of traditional power holders, including the military. His following remained strong even after his ouster, and his sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, became prime minister in 2011, only to have her Pheu Thai government also toppled by the army in 2014. Wednesday’s vote indicates that Prayuth’s coalition also has control — by a small margin — of the House, necessary to pass laws and approve budgets. But there are doubts that a government led by Prayuth, used to governing by fiat, can fare well in a parliamentary framework. “General Prayuth’s return to the premiership has gone according to the ... junta’s design. But managing a coalition government and a Parliament with a sizable opposition is very different from overseeing a military dictatorship,” said Michael Montesano, co-ordinator of the Thailand Studies Program at Singapore’s ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute. “If observers are right and the new coalition proves too unstable to last more than a few months, the fear that another coup will pitch Thailand into an even bleaker situation is on the mind of many.” An open-ended parliamentary debate, with the two sides touting the merits of their candidate and the weaknesses of their opponent, pushed Wednesday’s vote late into the night. The official result was announced just before midnight. During the debate, Palang Pracharath lawmaker Koranis Ngamsukonrattana praised Prayuth for his character and his vision. “He’s patient and sacrificed himself so much for the country,” he said. “He’s the saviour who came in and saved the country when all hope was lost.” Thanathorn’s supporters attacked Prayuth as a destroyer of democracy. “Coups are the ultimate crime against the rule of democracy with the monarch as head of state,” said Piyabutr Saengkanokkul, secretary general of Thanathorn’s Future Forward party. “It rips apart the entire constitution and takes power to rule over the country by establishing yourself as a ‘sovereign’ with the highest power.” It was a novelty for Thais to see such parliamentary battling after five years of army rule in which there was only a tame rubberstamp assembly. While the formation of a government will finally return Thailand officially to civilian rule, it will be done under a new political system enacted by the junta Prayuth has led and its appointees. It is a system that critics say is meant to prolong rule by the military and its allies in the conservative establishment, rather than reflect the will of everyday Thais. The Palang Pracharath coalition was opposed by the “Democratic Front,” comprising seven anti-military parties led by Pheu Thai. They nominated the charismatic young Thanathorn as their candidate for prime minister. Future Forward, whose platform included strong opposition to military interference in politics, finished a strong third in the March election. Its unexpected performance has drawn it a raft of legal challenges from the military’s supporters, and Thanathorn himself has been suspended from Parliament until the constitutional Court decides whether be violated election law by allegedly holding shares in a media company. Neither candidate was present for Wednesday’s debate. Prayuth attended to official government business, while Thanathorn was absent from the assembly hall due to a court-ordered suspension that his supporters charge is politically motivated.

"233"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-sudans-opposition-rejects-military-chiefs-offer-of-talks-as-death/"|"Khalid Abdelaziz"|"Sudan’s military rulers offered to resume talks with opposition groups on Wednesday, two days after security forces mounted a deadly raid on a protest camp, but the opposition rejected the invitation. Medics linked to the opposition said the death toll from Monday’s operation and subsequent unrest had risen to 108 and that it was expected to increase further. No official casualty figures have been released. The raid, which followed weeks of wrangling between the ruling military council and opposition groups over who should lead Sudan’s transition to democracy, marked the worst outbreak of violence since the army ousted president Omar al-Bashir in April after months of protests against his rule. The Transitional Military Council cancelled all agreements it had reached with the opposition immediately after the raid but on Wednesday it rowed back amid mounting international criticism of the violence. “We in the military council extend our hand for negotiations without shackles except the interests of the homeland,” its head, Lieutenant-General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, said on state TV. But a Sudanese alliance of protesters and opposition groups rejected the offer, saying the military could not be trusted. “Today the council invited us to dialogue and at the same time it is imposing fear on citizens in the streets,” Madani Abbas Madani, a leader of the Declaration of Freedom and Change Forces (DFCF), told Reuters. Mr. Madani said Lt.-Gen. Burhan’s invitation had come before the arrest of one of the opposition alliance members, Yasir Arman, deputy head of the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N) rebel group. Opposition medics said that 40 dead bodies had been pulled out of the Nile on Tuesday and taken to an unknown destination by pickup trucks belonging to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. Since then several more have lost their lives, bringing the total death toll from the recent violence to 108, the medics said. Later on Wednesday, however, an official with the Sudanese Health Ministry disputed that number, saying 46 people had died. Reuters was not immediately able to verify the report. A military council spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment, but the council said on Twitter that some Rapid Support Forces members had been attacked and that people had put on their uniforms to impersonate them in an attempt to harm their reputation. The mood in the capital, Khartoum, remained tense on Wednesday, with demonstrators blocking streets in several districts. Gunfire rang out in the distance. Most shops were shuttered on what would usually have been a bustling Muslim Eid al-Fitr holiday. Minor protests erupted outside mosques after Eid prayers but there were no reports of significant clashes with security forces. The deputy head of the military council, General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, commonly known as Hemedti, said in a televised speech that it had launched “an urgent and transparent investigation” into the recent violence. “Any person who crossed boundaries has to be punished,” he added. The military has denied trying to clear the sit-in protest outside the Defence Ministry on Monday. Its spokesman said forces moved in to deal with disruptive groups nearby and the violence spread from there. Saudi Arabia, which has close ties to Sudan’s military council, said on Wednesday it was watching developments with great concern and called for more dialogue. U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton said in a Twitter post that Monday’s violence by Sudan’s security forces was “abhorrent” and demanded that the military council facilitate moves toward a civilian-led government. The main protest organizer, the Sudanese Professionals Association, has called for an international committee to investigate Monday’s deaths in what it branded a “massacre.” Several airlines have cancelled flights to Khartoum, including Bahrain’s Gulf Air, flydubai and EgyptAir. Sudan has been rocked by unrest since December, when anger over rising bread prices and cash shortages broke into sustained protests against Mr. al-Bashir that culminated in the military removing him after three decades in office.

The Australian Broadcasting Corporation said the raid, the second in as many days by police investigating government leaks, raised questions about media freedom in the country. “It is highly unusual for the national broadcaster to be raided in this way,” ABC managing director David Anderson said in a statement. “This is a serious development and raises legitimate concerns over freedom of the press and proper public scrutiny of national security and defence matters.” The raid in a suburb of Sydney came a day after federal police searched the Canberra home of Annika Smethurst, the political editor of The Sunday Telegraph of Sydney, over a 2018 story detailing an alleged government proposal to spy on Australians. News Corp. Australia, the parent company of The Sunday Telegraph, said the raid “demonstrates a dangerous act of intimidation towards those committed to telling uncomfortable truths.” There were no arrests in either raid. Australian law forbids officials from disclosing secret information, and the police warrants in both raids were based on a law enacted in 1914. The police said in a statement that the two raids were not linked. Anderson said ABC stood by its journalists, would protect its sources and continue to report “without fear or favour” on national security and intelligence issues. “We will be doing everything we can to limit the scope of this and we will do everything we can to stand by our reporters and as a general observation, we always do whatever we can to stand by our sources of course,” ABC editorial director Craig McMurtrie said.

"235"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-imf-warns-us-china-tariffs-could-slash-global-growth-in-2020/"|"David Lawder"|"The International Monetary Fund does not see the threat of a global recession brought on by a widening U.S.-China trade war and potential U.S. tariffs on Mexican goods and autos, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said on Wednesday. Lagarde told Reuters in an interview, however, that such escalating tariff threats were sapping business and market confidence, and could slow growth that is currently expected to improve next year. “We don’t see a recession,” Lagarde said when asked whether U.S. President Donald Trump’s threatened tariff actions could turn global growth negative. “Decelerating growth, but growth nonetheless — 3.3 per cent at the end of this year, and certainly a strong U.S. economy. We do not see at the moment, in our baseline, a recession.” Earlier on Wednesday, the IMF said current and threatened U.S.-China tariffs could cut 2020 global gross domestic product by 0.5 per cent, or about $455 billion — a loss larger than G20 member South Africa’s annual economic output. The estimate includes a recent U.S. tariff increase to 25 per cent on a $200 billion list of Chinese imports as well as Trump’s threat to tax another $300 billion worth of consumer imports, representing nearly all trade between the world’s two largest economies. The IMF’s estimate does not include Trump’s threatened 5 per cent tariffs on goods from Mexico starting on Monday over immigration issues and ratcheting up monthly. Mexico has overtaken China this year as the largest U.S. trading partner. Lagarde called such actions “self-inflicted wounds” that must be avoided, a message she will take to a G20 finance ministers and central bank governors meeting in Fukuoka, Japan this weekend. “One more tariff here, one more threat there, one more negotiation that has not yet started, add to a global uncertainty which is not conducive to additional growth,” she told Reuters. In a briefing note for G20 finance leaders, the IMF said that U.S. tariffs and Chinese retaliatory measures currently in place could cut 2020 output 0.3 per cent, with more than half of that impact coming from negative effects on business confidence and financial market sentiment. The IMF also on Wednesday cut its China growth forecasts for 2019 and 2020 due to the growing trade tensions. The Fund is due to release preliminary findings of its annual assessment of the U.S. economy on Thursday. The IMF is predicting 3.6 per cent global growth for 2020, but said this outlook is vulnerable to trade tensions, uncertainty over Britain’s exit from the European Union, and uncertain recoveries in some stressed economies such as Argentina and Turkey. Asked whether the IMF needed to take a tougher stance against U.S. tariff actions, Lagarde said the Fund had to keep presenting facts and economic research to tell leaders: “If you go in that direction, these are the consequences. It’s for political leaders and for policymakers to decide what is in their interest.” Lagarde said she would discuss the IMF review of its quotas and other financial resources with G20 policymakers in Fukuoka this weekend. While the United States is opposed to increasing the Fund’s quotas, or voting shares, Lagarde said she has had good dialogs with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin about the need to maintain the IMF’s total lending war chest of about $1 trillion. “Having gone through the crisis 10 years ago and knowing the power of the fire powder that you can commit, I think it’s critically important to give a signal that the capacity to commit $1 trillion today if there is a multiple-country crisis should actually be preserved,” Lagarde said, adding she was confident that the IMF will find ways to maintain its crisis lending fund by an October deadline.

"236"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-british-pm-candidate-gove-says-he-would-delay-brexit-rather-than-rush/"|"Guy Faulconbridge"|"Michael Gove, a leading contenders to replace British Prime Minister Theresa May, said he would delay Brexit rather than rush into a no-deal exit that could trigger an election that would propel Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to power. The United Kingdom could be heading toward a constitutional crisis over Brexit as many of the candidates vying to succeed May are prepared to leave the EU on Oct. 31 without a deal but parliament has indicated it will try to thwart such a scenario. Nearly three years since the United Kingdom voted 52 per cent-48 per cent to leave the EU, the ruling Conservative Party had its worst result in centuries in a European election last month, and opinion polls indicate a snap election would produce a hung parliament. Gove, who scuppered the 2016 leadership bid of former foreign minister Boris Johnson by withdrawing his support at the last moment to run himself, said he would seek a further delay to Brexit if efforts to renegotiate the deal were close to a breakthrough. “Would it really be in our best interests to opt for a no-deal exit when just a little more time and effort could make all the difference?” Gove said in an article in the Daily Mail newspaper. Other contenders – including Johnson, Andrea Leadsom, Dominic Raab and Sajid Javid – have said they would seek to negotiate a deal but, if that were not possible, they would then lead the world’s fifth largest economy out of the EU without any agreement. Gove said to rush into a no-deal exit would lead to a Labour government propped up by the Scottish National Party which wants another referendum on Scottish independence. “That would surely hand Downing Street to a Jeremy Corbyn government propped up by Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP. That would mean Brexit was lost, the future of our Union at risk and the levers of power handed to a Marxist,” he wrote. Some European officials have cautioned that London will find it hard to delay Brexit again as EU leaders question what would be the point of an extension. “It would be very, very, very difficult to reach an agreement on another extension, if at all requested,” said a senior government official of one EU member state who deals with EU affairs, including Brexit. May’s failure to deliver Brexit by the original March 29 deadline destroyed her premiership. But any new British prime minister, expected to be in place by the last days of July, will face a deadlocked political system. Parliament has repeatedly rejected May’s EU divorce deal but also failed to agree on how, when or even if the United Kingdom will leave the club it joined in 1973. If a British leader went for a no-deal Brexit, lawmakers have vowed to prevent it. The easiest way would be to bring down the government in a vote of no confidence. While the Conservative Party’s lawmakers, who get the first say on who should be prime minister, are divided over Brexit, the party’s 160,000 members, who get the final vote on candidates in a run off, are much more supportive of leaving without agreement. The EU has refused to renegotiate the Withdrawal Agreement reached with May last November, and Ireland has indicated it is not willing to discuss changes to the Irish border “backstop” that upset the party which props up May’s minority government. The backstop – designed to ensure frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and Ireland – would force the U.K. to follow many EU rules unless and until “alternative arrangements” ensuring no hard border were agreed. “We need a new approach to Northern Ireland,” said Gove, a 51-year-old environment minister. “We have to remove any risk that we could be trapped in a backstop, so I will work with the Irish government and Brussels to secure a clear exit mechanism.” Gove, a prominent Brexit campaigner during the 2016 referendum, said he was convinced the EU would negotiate and he said he wanted a bespoke Canada-style trade deal. “Always choose Brexit over no Brexit,” Gove said. “If, finally, it comes to a decision between no deal and no Brexit, I will choose no deal.” "|"British PM candidate Gove says he would delay Brexit rather than rush into a no-deal exit"|"2019-06-06T09:04:50-0400"|"Brexit,Theresa May,Michael Gove,Jeremy Corbyn,EU,EU electons,Conservative Party leadership,news,europe,brexit,deal,gove,ireland,election,exit", 
"237"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-denying-spousal-benefits-to-same-sex-couples-is-unlawful-hong-kong/"|"Katie Tam"|"Hong Kong’s Court of Final Appeal said Thursday the government cannot deny spousal employment benefits to same-sex couples, in a ruling hailed as a major step forward for same-sex equality in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory. The court overturned an earlier judgment, saying unanimously that denying same-sex couples access to spousal benefits is unlawful. “It follows therefore that the ‘prevailing views of the community on marriage’ … even if this can confidently be gauged in the first place, are simply not relevant to a consideration of the justification exercise,” the ruling said. Although same-sex marriage is not recognized in Hong Kong, the judgment appears to move the territory further in that direction. Last year, the Court of Final Appeal ruled that the same-sex partner of a British expatriate married abroad was entitled to the same visa treatment as a heterosexual partner under immigration law. Angus Leung, a senior immigration officer who brought the case on behalf of himself and his partner, Scott Adams, said the ruling was the culmination of a stressful four-year process. “We understand that it is just a small step for the equality in Hong Kong,” Leung told reporters as he and Adams held hands outside the courthouse. “We think that as a small citizen, we shouldn’t be going through such a process to fight for such a basic family right.” Leung urged the government to rectify discriminatory policies and legislation so that other couples wouldn’t have to undergo the same legal process. Man-kei Tam, director of Amnesty International Hong Kong, called Thursday’s judgment a “huge step forward for equality” that brings Hong Kong “more in line with its international obligation to respect, protect and fulfill the rights of people with different sexual orientations.” Tam also called on the government to review its laws, policies and practices to end all discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity and intersex status, saying, “No one should experience discrimination because of who they are or who they love.” It isn’t clear what effect the ruling might have on private businesses and organizations, although some already offer benefits to same-sex partners as they compete for top talent in finance, marketing and other fields for which Hong Kong is famous. In another sign of acceptance, the city of 7.4 million people is also preparing to host the 2022 Gay Games. Last month, Taiwan became the first place in Asia to allow same-sex marriage in a legislative vote on a cause that the island’s LGBT rights activists have championed for two decades. Hundreds of same-sex couples rushed to get married on the first day the decision took effect. In mainland China, the Communist Party-controlled government has ruled out the possibility of same-sex marriage without ever hearing legal arguments on the matter and strictly limits the activities of gay rights organizations. Hong Kong is a former British colony and maintains its own Western-style legal system distinct from China’s heavily politicized courts. With its large semi-permanent foreign population, the city is also far more socially liberal than the mainland. Still, Hong Kong’s High Court earlier this year refused to allow three transgender men to be recognized as males on their official identity cards because they have not undergone full sex-change operations.

"238"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-us-pursuing-sale-of-more-than-2-billion-in-weapons-to-taiwan/"|"Mike Stone Patricia Zengerle"|"The United States is pursuing the sale of more than $2-billion worth of tanks and weapons to Taiwan, four people familiar with the negotiations said, sparking anger from Beijing which is already involved in an escalating trade war with Washington. An informal notification of the proposed sale has been sent to the U.S. Congress, the four sources said on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the possible deal. The potential sale included 108 General Dynamics Corp M1A2 Abrams tanks worth around $2-billion as well as anti-tank and anti-aircraft munitions, three of the sources said. Taiwan has been interested in refreshing its existing U.S.-made battle tank inventory, which includes M60 Patton tanks. The United States is the main arms supplier to Taiwan, which China deems its own and has never renounced the use of force to bring the self-ruled island under its control. Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said in March Washington was responding positively to Taipei’s requests for new arms sales to bolster its defences in the face of pressure from China. The United States has no formal ties with Taiwan but is bound by law to help provide it with the means to defend itself. China and the United States are engaged in a fierce trade war, with clashes over Taiwan and the South China Sea exacerbating tensions. A spokesman for the State Department, which oversees foreign military sales, said the U.S. government does not comment on or confirm potential or pending arms sales or transfers before they have been formally notified to Congress. The congressional notifications included a variety of anti-tank munitions, including 409 Raytheon Co and Lockheed Martin Corp-made Javelin missiles worth as much as $129-million, two of the sources said. The notifications also included 1,240 TOW anti-tank missiles worth as much as $299-million, one of the sources said. There were also 250 stinger missiles worth as much as $223-million in the notification, the source said. Stingers are often used in portable anti-aircraft weapons systems. Taiwan’s Defense Ministry confirmed it had requested those weapons and that the request was proceeding normally. The U.S. commitment to providing Taiwan with the weapons to defend itself helps Taiwan’s military to raise its combat abilities, consolidates the Taiwan-U.S. security partnership and ensures Taiwan’s security, the ministry said in a statement. The Chinese government condemned the planned sale. “We are severely concerned about the U.S. move and are firmly against U.S. arms sales to Taiwan,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a daily news briefing in Beijing. China urges the United States to stop arms sales to Taiwan and prudently deal with issues relating to Taiwan to prevent harm to bilateral relations and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, he added. U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration rolled out a long-awaited overhaul of U.S. arms export policy in 2018 aimed at expanding sales to allies, saying it would bolster the American defence industry and create jobs at home. Trump’s trade adviser Peter Navarro was one of the administration’s architects of that policy. Navarro, a China hawk, wrote about the possible sale of tanks to Taiwan in a March opinion column in the New York Times ahead of a presidential trip to the Lima, Ohio, plant where they are made. At a low point, the U.S. Army had only one tank coming from the plant a month, General Dynamics CEO Phebe Novakovic said during an April conference call with investors, but said “we’ll be rolling out 30 tanks a month by the end of this year,” partly because of international orders. The Pentagon announced last week it would sell 34 ScanEagle drones, made by Boeing Co, to the governments of Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam for $47-million. The drones would afford greater intelligence-gathering capabilities, potentially curbing Chinese activity in the region. China claims almost all of the strategic South China Sea and frequently lambastes the United States and its allies over naval operations near Chinese-occupied islands. Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam all have competing claims. China’s Defense Minister Wei Fenghe warned the United States at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore last weekend not to meddle in security disputes over Taiwan and the South China Sea. Acting U.S. Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan told the meeting that the United States would no longer “tiptoe” around China’s behaviour in Asia. Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry, responding to the Reuters report of planned the new arms sale, said Wei’s “threatening” comments and recent Chinese military drills near Taiwan showed the importance of its need to strengthen its defensive abilities. “Going forward our government will continue to deepen the close security partnership between Taiwan and the United States,” it said.

"239"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-economic-woes-face-thailands-junta-chief-turned-civilian-prime/"|"Orathai Sriring Satawasin Staporncharnchai"|"Thailand’s junta chief-turned-civilian prime minister Prayuth Chan-ocha faces a tough task in reviving a faltering economy and sinking investor confidence – the same problems as when he seized power in a military coup five years ago. Prayuth was confirmed as prime minister by parliament on Wednesday but he will be leading a fragile 19-party coalition with only a four-seat majority in the House of Representatives. That raises concerns about passing legislation and the budget that could disrupt public spending on much-needed larger investment projects and keep investors away. “This scenario appears vulnerable to the risk of a weak and short-lived government … thus, causing a risk of policy discontinuity,” said Charnon Boonnuch, economist at Nomura in Singapore. “Political uncertainty will remain high and continue to weigh on the growth outlook.” Investors have been worried about political risk since no clear winner emerged from Thailand’s March 24 general election. Southeast Asia’s second-largest economy grew 2.8 per cent in the first quarter from a year earlier, the weakest since 2014, as public investment, exports and tourism slowed amid rising global trade tensions and political risks at home. Political uncertainty has affected private sector sentiment and dampened prospects for public spending this year, said Sarun Sunansathaporn, economist of Bank of Ayudhya, who slashed his 2019 economic growth forecast to 3.2 per cent from 3.8 per cent. Growth was 4.1 per cent in 2018, the fastest in six years, but still lagged the Philippines’ 6.2 per cent and Indonesia’s 5.17 per cent. The central bank said last month that heightened political uncertainties have clouded the outlook for economic policy. It is expected to cut its growth forecast – currently at 3.8 per cent – for a third time in six months later this month. Thailand’s state planning agency said the fiscal 2020 budget will be delayed by 2-4 months, adding to the problems of already slow public spending and thus holding back private investment. Listed firms’ free cash flow – cash that is yet to be invested – are at 10-year highs of about 250 billion baht ($7.9-billion), said Naris Sathapholdeja, head of TMB Analytics. Initiatives such as the ambitious $45-billion Eastern Economic Corridor project to draw investment into the country’s industrial east could be delayed if the coalition is unable to work together and the budget is gridlocked. The junta has taken some cautious steps to lift growth, largely through short-term economic measures and subsidies for low-income earners, analysts said, but more action is needed beyond simply staying on the same course. “If we want the economy to grow 3.5 per cent this year, the new government will need additional stimulus measures worth 30 billion baht to 50 billion baht,” said Thanavath Phonvichai, an economics professor at the University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce. Although the new government is expected to introduce economic measures to boost consumption, its instability will continue to weigh on market sentiment, said Saharat Chudsuwan, head of marketing and wealth advisory of Tisco Asset Management. “Everyone believes the government may not be stable. If the stock market ever rises because of the election, it may not go very far,” he said. The Thai stock market has risen about 5 per cent this year, driven by recent foreign fund inflows across the region, but still trailing the Philippines and Vietnam. Industry still hopes for some stability, as business sentiment was at a 3-month low in April while consumer confidence hit its lowest in 19 months in May. “We want a new government to be formed quickly and to be stable,” said Supant Mongkolsuthree, chairman of the Federation of Thai Industries. “If the government is stable, investment will improve and foreign trade negotiations will be more credible,” he said.

"240"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-former-german-nurse-found-guilty-of-killing-85-patients-sentenced-to/"|"David Rising"|"Niels Hoegel liked to bring about cardiac arrests in his patients by injecting them with overdoses of heart medication and other drugs because he enjoyed the feeling of being able to resuscitate them. Sometimes he succeeded in bringing them back, but in at least 87 cases they died, making him what is believed to be modern Germany’s most prolific serial killer. A court in the northwestern city of Oldenburg on Thursday found the 42-year-old nurse guilty of murdering 85 patients, aged 34 to 96, and sentenced him to life in prison. He had earlier been convicted of two other killings. “Your guilt is incomprehensible,” presiding judge Sebastian Buerhmann said as he handed down the verdict. “I felt like an accountant of death.” Hoegel worked at a hospital in Oldenburg between 1999 and 2002 and another hospital in nearby Delmenhorst from 2003 to 2005, and the killings took place between 2000 and 2005, the dpa news agency reported. Hoegel was convicted in 2015 of two murders and two attempted murders and is already currently serving a life sentence. There are no consecutive sentences in the German system, but Buerhmann noted in his verdict the “particular seriousness” of Hoegel’s crimes, a finding that all but ensures he will remain incarcerated after the standard 15-year term is up. During his first trial, Hoegel said he intentionally brought about cardiac crises in some 90 patients in Delmenhorst because he enjoyed the feeling of being able to resuscitate them. He later told investigators that he also killed patients in Oldenburg. That prompted a wider investigation involving both hospitals, and police and prosecutors reviewed more than 500 patient files and hundreds more hospital records. They also exhumed 134 bodies from 67 cemeteries, and questioned Hoegel multiple times, concluding that he had used a variety of drugs to attempt resuscitation of his patients, and was fully aware they might die. Prosecutors noted that many of Hoegel’s victims were not terminally ill patients, but were on the path to recovery. “The fact is sometimes the worst fantasy is not enough to describe the truth,” Buehrmann said. In all, Hoegel was tried in Oldenburg on 100 counts of murder, but the court found him not guilty on 15 counts for lack of evidence, which Buerhmann noted with regret to the family members present. “We were not able to shine light through part of the fog that lay over this trial,” Buehrmann said. “That also fills with a certain sadness.” Frank Brinkers, whose father was thought to have been killed by Hoegel, was one of those left wondering because the court could not definitively prove culpability. “That is very, very bitter,” Brinkers said after the verdict. “I have gone through hell and that is hard to bear.” Pleas are not entered in the German system but during the seven-month trial, Hoegel admitted to 43 of the killings, disputed five and said he couldn’t remember the other 52. Hoegel testified that he had a “protected” childhood, free of violence. He said his grandmother and his father, who were both nurses, had been his role models for going into the profession. “Now I sit here fully convinced that I want to give every relative an answer,” Hoegel said during the trial. “I am really sorry.” An expert testified during the trial that while Hoegel suffered from personality disorders, he was psychologically competent to stand trial and serve his sentence. In his closing statement to the court on Wednesday, Hoegel reiterated his earlier apology, expressing shame and remorse, and saying he realized how much pain and suffering he had caused with his “terrible deeds.” “To each and every one of you I sincerely apologize for all that I have done,” he said.

"241"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-captain-of-cruise-liner-involved-in-fatal-hungary-collision-had/"|"Marton Dunai"|"The captain of a cruise liner involved in a fatal collision with a pleasure boat on the River Danube in Budapest last week had captained a boat that was in an accident in the Netherlands in April, Hungarian prosecutors said on Thursday. It is unclear what caused the worst accident in more than half a century on the Danube, Europe’s longest river and an increasingly popular route for massive hotel cruisers. Police are investigating. The Viking Sigyn’s captain, a 64-year-old Ukrainian man identified by police as C. Yuriy from Odessa, was arrested last week in Budapest and is being held as a suspect. His lawyers said he is devastated but did nothing wrong. They could not be reached for comment. The prosecutors also said in a statement that the captain had “deleted data from his phone” after the collision on May 29, which killed 28 people, most of them South Korean tourists. They said it was unclear whether the data was related to the accident. The Mermaid, carrying South Koreans on a pleasure cruise, capsized and sank after being struck by the larger Viking Sigyn. Hungarian prosecutors said they had learned through an EU judicial network that the captain was also captain of a boat that was in an accident in the Netherlands on April 1. Media reports said that in the incident referred to, the Viking Idun river ship collided with a cargo vessel while sailing from Antwerp to Ghent. According to a Viking statement cited in media nobody on the Idun was injured. Swiss-based Viking Cruises Ltd, which owns the Viking Sigyn as well as the Viking Idun, said last week it was co-operating with Hungarian investigators and could not comment while a criminal case was under way. Viking spokespeople did not immediately reply to Reuters questions seeking fresh comment. The operator of The Mermaid has not responded to requests for comment on the accident. Seven Koreans were rescued alive. Seventeen bodies have been recovered and 11 people are officially listed as missing and presumed dead, including a Korean child and two Hungarian crew. News website Atlatszo.hu said police have interviewed close to 300 witnesses and analyzed 40 CCTV recordings. Police spokesman Kristof Gal said that was a plausible ballpark figure, without confirming the precise numbers. The Budapest disaster occurred in heavy rain. In the week since, flooding on the river has receded, allowing divers to reach the wreck and recover some of the bodies. Corpses have also begun to surface at the wreck site and further downstream. South Korea’s practice of fingerprinting all adult citizens has helped forensic experts identify all of the bodies recovered so far, officials said on Thursday. Police lieutenant-colonel Zsuzsanna Kreitz said that in such accidents, corpses are damaged and identification through photographs and ID cards becomes impossible. “We use fingerprints, DNA and dental records instead,” she said. Work continued to salvage the ship as soon as possible, said Nandor Jasenszky, spokesman of the counterterrorism agency TEK, which co-ordinates the recovery operation. Divers welded hooks and inserted rods under the sunken Mermaid, their work hampered by strong currents and zero visibility in the river. Once the gear is in place, a giant floating salvage crane will be used to lift the wreck. That could come as early as Friday, Jasenszky said, adding that the conditions on the river remain unpredictable so delays are quite possible – citing a huge piece of wood debris that got caught up near the Mermaid on Thursday. “You must be prepared for anything and everything on the Danube,” he said. “You can’t stick to plans down to the second.” "|"Captain of cruise liner involved in fatal Hungary collision had previous accident, prosecutors say"|"2019-06-06T11:38:43-0400"|"Hungary,Hungary boat collision,Danube River,Viking Sigyn,South Korea,South Korean tour boat,The Mermain,news,world,captain,accident,comment,boat,police,week", 
"242"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-russia-has-no-plans-to-send-troops-to-venezuela-putin-says/"|"Gary Pruitt"|"Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday reaffirmed his staunch denial that his government meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election despite the extensive evidence to the contrary, and insisted Moscow has no intention of interfering in any future votes, either. Speaking in response to a question from The Associated Press during a meeting with chief executives of international news agencies in St. Petersburg, the Russian leader said that “we didn’t meddle, we aren’t meddling and we will not meddle in any elections.” Putin and other Russian officials have hotly denied any interference with the U.S. vote to help Donald Trump win the presidency, even though U.S. special counsel Robert Mueller has uncovered evidence of a Kremlin operation to interfere with the 2016 vote. He charged 12 Russian military intelligence officers with breaking into Democratic Party e-mails, and also indicted other Russians who used phony social media accounts to spread divisive rhetoric and to undermine the U.S. political system. Putin insisted that “we don’t have and never had any plans to interfere in U.S. domestic politics,” but added that the Russian government can’t stop private citizens from expressing their views about developments in the U.S. online. “How can we ban them from doing that?” he said. “Do you have such a ban with regard to Russia?” The president added that Russia had offered to agree on a set of rules regarding modern communications to President Barack Obama’s administration and then Trump’s White House, but neither was ready to make the deal. During his meeting, Putin also warned that the U.S. reluctance to start talks on extending a key arms control pact raises the threat of an uncontrollable arms race, and said that Moscow has no plans to send troops to shore up Venezuela’s embattled leader. Asked about Trump’s tweet this week that Moscow had informed Washington it had “removed most of their people from Venezuela,” Putin said that Russian experts come and go to service Russian-made weapons bought by Caracas. “We aren’t building any military bases there, we aren’t sending troops there, we have never done that,” Putin said. “But we have fulfilled our contract obligations in the sphere of military-technical co-operation and we will keep doing that.” The Russian leader said the U.S. sanctions against Venezuela have hurt ordinary people, and warned Washington against using force to oust Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Russia has staunchly backed Maduro, while the U.S. and several dozen other nations have thrown their support behind opposition leader Juan Guaido and recognized him as interim president, asserting that Maduro’s re-election last year was illegitimate. Putin said “the crisis in Venezuela should be settled by the Venezuelan people,” adding that “through dialogue, consultations and co-operation between various political forces, the Venezuelan people themselves must decide whether Mr. Maduro should stay in power or not.” The Russian leader said he feels “absolutely neutral” about Guaido, describing him as a “nice person,” but charged that his leadership claim has created a precedent that could “lead to chaos across the world.” “Let them elect U.S. presidents, British prime ministers and French presidents like that,” he said. “And where will all that lead? I would like to ask those who support it: Are you mad?” Putin issued a stern warning about the danger of a new arms race. He accused the United States of shunning talks on extending the New START nuclear arms reduction treaty that is set to expire in 2021. Putin said that while Russia has repeatedly signalled its intention to begin discussions on extending the pact, Washington has been unresponsive. “We have said 100 times already that we are ready, but no one is talking to us,” he said. The New START that was signed in 2010 by Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers. Putin added that Russia’s new weapons will protect its security “for a long time to come” even if the pact isn’t extended, but he voiced concern about the “complete dismantling of arms control mechanisms.” Putin also criticized the U.S. withdrawal from another key arms pact, the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, denying Washington’s claims of Russian violations of the agreement. Citing those alleged violations, the U.S. has formally suspended its obligations under the INF that bans all land-based cruise and ballistic missiles with a range of 500 to 5,500 kilometres (310 to 3,410 miles), setting the stage for the treaty to terminate later this year. Russia, which has denied any breaches, has followed suit. While criticizing the U.S. moves, Putin said that his latest phone call with Trump “encouraged certain optimism.” He said that Trump shared his concern about the arms race and suggested that the money spent on new weapons would be better used for other purposes. The Russian leader noted that arms control talks should eventually involve other nuclear powers. “As of now, the talks between us as the countries that have the most powerful nuclear arsenals are the most important, but I believe that all nuclear powers – both official and unofficial – should be brought in,” Putin said.

Ms. McKee’s shooting in April by an Irish nationalist militant during a riot in the city sparked outrage in the province where a 1998 peace deal mostly ended three decades of sectarian violence that cost the lives of some 3,600 people. Police, who suspect the gunman who shot Ms. McKee dead is in his late teens, have arrested and released several people since the killing. The man arrested on Thursday will be questioned under counterterrorism legislation. A number of items were also seized and taken for examination, police said in a statement.

Gay-rights advocates welcomed the apology, which they had sought from the NYPD for years. Police raided the Stonewall, a Greenwich Village tavern, in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969. At the time, homosexuality was criminalized and most gay bars, including the Stonewall, were operated by organized crime. Patrons of the bar fought back that night and several days thereafter, leading to unprecedented demonstrations for the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. Activists memorialized the first anniversary of the Stonewall rebellion with what they called Christopher Street Liberation Day, starting an annual gay-pride tradition that is now celebrated around the world. The NYPD had resisted previous calls to apologize, but Commissioner James O’Neill chose Thursday to tell a gathering of gay-rights advocates that this month’s World Pride events in New York for the 50th anniversary of Stonewall marked the right moment. “What happened should not have happened,” Commissioner O’Neill said. “The actions taken by the NYPD were wrong, plain and simple. The actions and the laws were discriminatory and oppressive, and for that, I apologize.” Organizers expect some four million people to visit New York later this month for World Pride. New York’s parade will be held June 30. James Fallarino, spokesman for the group NYC Pride, said he welcomed Commissioner O’Neill’s apologies. “He represents the institution, and the institution and their violence against our community is one of the reasons why Pride exists,” he said. “It’s really important that the institution take responsibility for what happened.” Former commissioner William Bratton refused to apologize three years ago while acknowledging the raid was a “terrible experience.” “An apology, I don’t think so. I don’t think that’s necessary,” Mr. Bratton said. “The apology is all that’s occurred since then.” Seymour Pine, the retired deputy police inspector who led the raid, apologized in 2004 before a New York Historical Society event, The New York Times reported in Mr. Pine’s 2010 obituary.

Some 2,025 cases and 1,357 deaths have been recorded since the epidemic began in August in the Democratic Republic of Congo’s North Kivu and Ituri provinces, said Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme. It is the second-worst outbreak of the virus on record. Some 88 infections have been detected each of the past two weeks, down from a peak of 126 weekly in April, and WHO teams are following up on 15,000 suspected contacts each day, a “huge number” who require checking for symptoms, he added. “We believe – let me be very cautious here – we believe we are probably detecting in excess of 75 per cent of cases – we may be missing up to a quarter of cases,” Dr. Ryan told a news briefing in Geneva. Late detection of cases was still a problem, he added. “We must get earlier detection of cases, have more exhaustive identification of contacts.” About 90 per cent of people potentially exposed to the virus have agreed to be vaccinated, which has proved efficient, he said. “It’s not them that matter now, it’s the 10 per cent that don’t, because all of our cases are coming from that group.” The epidemic was not under control, he said, and was spreading fast in the rural area of Mabalako and at a lesser rate in the city of Butembo. Dr. Ryan said risks to aid workers had decreased of late, but noted a deadly attack on civilians earlier this week. A local official said 13 civilians were killed late on Monday in an attack by the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) – a group thought to be linked to Islamic State. Greater political engagement is needed to combat the Ebola outbreak, Dr. Ryan said. “We need the government to reach out to the opposition, we need an ‘all party’ approach … we need a single voice of leaders in Congo about this outbreak.” "|"Up to a quarter of Ebola cases in Congo may be undetected, WHO expert says"|"2019-06-06T14:12:58-0400"|"Congo,Ebola,Ebola cases,Ebola vaccine,WHO,health,news,world,cent,detection,congo,outbreak,quarter,case,cases",

Kelly pleaded not guilty to 11 additional sex-related charges on Thursday, including four counts that carry a maximum prison term of 30 years in prison. Prosecutors did not ask the judge to raise the bond amount for Mr. Kelly during the brief hearing in Cook County court. Mr. Kelly stood with his hands folded in front of him and listened to Judge Lawrence Flood describe the charges to him. When Justice Flood asked if he understood, Mr. Kelly, responded, “Yes, sir.” The Grammy award-winning singer, who has denied any wrongdoing, left without speaking to reporters. A status hearing was scheduled for June 26. Among the 11 new counts are four counts of aggravated criminal sexual assault, which carries a sentence of up to 30 years in prison. That is more than four times as long as the maximum term for each of the 10 counts Mr. Kelly was originally charged with in February. Mr. Kelly’s defence attorney, Steve Greenberg, said after the hearing that he couldn’t speculate as to why prosecutors brought the new charges, which pertain to one of the four women he was charged in February with sexually abusing years ago, three of whom were minors when the alleged abuse occurred. “It’s the same case. It’s just that they’ve just changed what they’ve charged him with,” Mr. Greenberg said. “It’s the same facts ... the same bond, the same evidence. We expect the same result.” Asked how Mr. Kelly is coping, Mr. Greenberg said, “It’s tough. Everything is against him.” Mr. Kelly’s spokesman, Darryll Johnson, told reporters that Mr. Kelly is “upbeat.” “Initially, he was a little depressed,” Mr. Johnson said. “But I mean, with anything, if someone accuses you of something, you’ll be depressed. He knows the truth.” According to the new indictment, the first eight counts are from encounters that allegedly occurred between Jan. 1 and Jan. 31, 2010. Three others pertain to alleged encounters between May 1, 2009, and Jan. 31, 2010. Among other things, prosecutors allege that Mr. Kelly used force or threatened to do so to put pressure on the accuser into having sex or performing oral sex on him. Since she was underage at the time, the statute of limitations for bringing charges was extended to 20 years from her 18th birthday, they wrote. A woman has come forward to say publicly that 11 new felony counts stem from allegations she made about the R&B singer. Jerhonda Pace wrote on her Facebook page that she’s the accuser identified as “J.P.” in court documents. Anticipating an angry reaction by Mr. Kelly’s fans, Ms. Pace – one of four women Mr. Kelly is charged with sexually abusing – wrote that “no matter how ”wrong“ you think I am, the law is on my side, a MINOR at the time.” The Associated Press doesn’t usually name alleged victims of sexual assault, but Ms. Pace has gone public with her allegations.

Ethiopia – where the continental bloc is based – planned a mediation effort, with Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed expected on Friday to meet members of both the ruling Transitional Military Council and the opposition, a diplomatic source said. Both sides had been in talks over a civilian-led transition to democracy. But their already-faltering negotiations collapsed when security forces stormed a sit-in protest camp Monday, killing dozens of people. Meeting in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa, the AU’s Peace and Security Council invoked its response to interruptions of constitutional rule by suspending Sudan. The European Union endorsed the AU’s decision, saying it “establishes clear criteria for the restoration of a peaceful and credible political process” in Sudan. It also urged foreign powers to refrain from interference in Sudan’s affairs and called for the release of Yasir Arman, the deputy head of the rebel Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-North who was arrested at his residence in Khartoum on Wednesday. Former colonial ruler Britain summoned Sudan’s ambassador to the Foreign Office on Thursday to express its concern. The Declaration of Freedom and Change Forces opposition alliance said it was not ready for more dialogue and demanded that the military hand over power. “The coup council and anyone involved in its crimes since April 11 must be held accountable,” it added in a statement, also demanding dissolution of the feared paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). Witnesses have said the RSF, which controls Khartoum, led the crackdown on the protest camp. The opposition says 108 people have died in violence since Monday, but Sudan’s Health Ministry put the toll at 61, including three security personnel it said were stabbed to death. The RSF, led by the governing military council’s deputy leader, General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, emerged from militias that fought insurgents in western Darfur since 2003. The militias are accused of atrocities in Darfur, and Mr. al-Bashir was indicted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes and genocide – which he denies. He is now detained in Khartoum. Rights group Amnesty International blamed the RSF for this week’s violence. “The RSF, the special military force which killed, raped and tortured thousands in Darfur, brings its murderous rampage to the capital,” it said. “Reports that bodies have been dumped in the river demonstrate the utter depravity of these so-called security forces.” The military council says Monday’s raid was targeting criminals in an area adjacent to the camp and got out of hand. It said it was the victim of a smear campaign and has promised an inquiry. State news agency SUNA said Thursday the public prosecutor had questioned a number of witnesses and vowed to complete the investigation as soon possible. The RSF’s high profile on the streets of Khartoum suggests Gen. Dagalo, a former Darfur fighter with a fearsome reputation, is calling the shots, at least when it comes to security. He is close to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and has committed Sudanese troops to the military coalition they lead in Yemen’s civil war. Although Monday’s raid had been followed by protests with roadblocks and fires, normal movement began to return to the Sudanese capital on Thursday. Witnesses said traffic was flowing again on main roads, although many shops remained closed. Sudan has been rocked since December when anger over rising bread prices and shortages turned into protests against Mr. al-Bashir that culminated in the military removing him after a three-decade rule. After Monday’s events, the military council cancelled all prior agreements with the opposition on a democratic transition and announced plans to hold elections within nine months. Protesters rejected that.

The mission now, they said, was to honour the dead and keep their memory alive, 75 years after the D-Day operation that portended the end of the Second World War. “We know we don’t have much time left, so I tell my story so people know it was because of that generation, because of those guys in this cemetery,” said 99-year-old Steve Melnikoff of Maryland, standing at Colleville-Sur-Mer, where thousands of Americans are buried. “All these generals with all this brass that don’t mean nothing,” he said. “These guys in the cemetery, they are the heroes.” Thursday’s anniversary was marked with eloquent speeches, profound silences – and passionate pleas for an end to bloodshed. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau hailed D-Day fighters who sacrificed their lives 75 years ago on the beaches of Normandy for future generations, “for you and me.” Speaking on Thursday where 14,000 Canadians landed on June 6, 1944, Mr. Trudeau said they “took a gamble the world had never seen before.” Thousands never made it home, many killed that very first day of the allied battle against the Nazis for Normandy. He lauded the resulting world order including the United Nations and North Atlantic Treaty Organization that have helped ensure peace since the Second World War, and called it “the responsibility of all Canadians to ensure that their story and their sacrifice will never be forgotten.” Their chests laden with medals, Canadian veterans listened solemnly, overlooking the tall grass and sandy expanse below. In a bilingual ceremony, young Canadians recited readings from D-Day fighters, saying “we are eternally grateful.” French President Emmanuel Macron and U.S. President Donald Trump praised the soldiers, sailors and airmen who took part in the invasion, code-named Operation Overlord, saying it was the turning point that ended Nazi tyranny and ensured peace for Europe. “You are the pride of our nation, you are the glory of our republic, and we thank you from the bottom of our heart,” Mr. Trump said of the warriors who took part in what he called the ultimate fight of good against evil in the Second World War. “They battled not for control and domination, but for liberty, democracy and self-rule,” Mr. Trump said in a speech at the Normandy American Cemetery overlooking Omaha Beach, the bloodiest of five landing beaches. Mr. Macron saluted the courage, generosity and strength of spirit that made them press on “to help men and women they didn’t know, to liberate a land most hadn’t seen before, for no other cause but freedom, democracy.” He expressed France’s debt to the United States for freeing his country from the Nazis. Mr. Macron awarded five American veterans with the Chevalier of Legion of Honour, France’s highest award. “We know what we owe to you, veterans, our freedom,” he said, switching from French to English. “On behalf of my nation I just want to say ‘thank you.’" About 160,000 troops took part in D-Day, and many more fought in the ensuing Battle of Normandy. Of those, 73,000 were from the United States, while 83,000 were from Britain and Canada. Troops started landing overnight from the air, then were joined by a massive force by sea on the beaches of Omaha, Utah, Juno, Sword and Gold, carried by 7,000 boats. “The eyes of the world are upon you. The hopes and prayers of liberty-loving people everywhere march with you,” General Dwight D. Eisenhower had said in his order of the day. “The tide has turned! The free men of the world are marching together to victory.” On Wednesday, a commemoration was held in Portsmouth, England, the main embarkation point for the transport boats. Then the dignitaries came to the bluffs and beaches of Normandy, where veterans recalled what they saw 75 years ago. “The water was full of dead men, the beach had burning landing craft,” said Jim Radford, 90, a British D-Day veteran from Hull, describing the scene near Gold Beach, where British landed. He was there again to watch the unveiling of a statue at Gold Beach, where a memorial to British fighters is to be erected. At dawn Thursday, hundreds of civilians and military alike from around the world gathered on Omaha Beach. Dick Jansen, 60, from the Netherlands, drank Canadian whisky from an enamel cup on the water’s edge. Others scattered carnations into the waves. Randall Atanay, the son of a medic who tended to the dying and wounded, waded barefoot into the water, bonding with his dad, who has since died. Up to 12,000 people attended the ceremony at the Normandy American Cemetery, with U.S. veterans, their numbers fast diminishing as years pass, the guests of honour. A 21-gun salute thundered into the waters below the cemetery, on a bluff overlooking Omaha Beach, and across the rows of white crosses and Stars of David. The final resting places of more than 9,380 of the fallen stretched out before the guests. Britain’s Prince Charles, his wife, Camilla, and Prime Minister Theresa May attended a remembrance service at the medieval cathedral in Bayeux, the first Normandy town liberated by Allied troops after D-Day. Hundreds of people packed the seaside square in the town of Arromanches to applaud veterans of the Battle of Normandy that ensued. A wreath was placed outside the town’s D-Day Museum. Gratitude was a powerful common theme. Mr. Macron thanked soldiers “so that France could become free again” at the Gold Beach ceremony with Ms. May and uniformed veterans laid the cornerstone of the memorial that will record the names of thousands of troops under British command who died in Normandy. “If one day can be said to have determined the fate of generations to come, in France, in Britain, in Europe and the world, that day was the 6th of June, 1944,” Ms. May said. As the sun rose that morning, not one of the thousands of men arriving in Normandy “knew whether they would still be alive when the sun set once again,” she said. Passing on memories is especially urgent, with hundreds of Second World War veterans now dying every day. But postwar tensions were evident. Not invited to the remembrance was Russian President Vladimir Putin, who had been present for the 70th commemoration of D-Day. On Wednesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said it was a “gift of history” that she was able to participate in the ceremony on Britain’s southern coast. Some 22,000 German soldiers are among those buried around Normandy. The D-Day invasion was a defining moment of military strategy complicated by unpredictable weather and human chaos in which soldiers from the U.S., Britain, Canada and other Allied countries applied relentless bravery to carve out a beachhead on ground that Nazi Germany had occupied for four years. The Battle of Normandy hastened Germany’s defeat less than a year later. Still, that single day cost the lives of 4,414 Allied troops, 2,501 of them Americans. More than 5,000 were injured. On the German side, several thousand were killed or wounded. From there, Allied troops would advance, take Paris in late summer and race with the Soviet Red Army to control as much German territory as possible by the time Adolf Hitler died in his Berlin bunker and Germany surrendered in May 1945. The Soviet Union also fought valiantly against the Nazis – and lost more people than any other country in the Second World War – but those final battles would divide Europe for decades between the West and the Soviet-controlled East, the faceoff line of the Cold War. “War is the most idiotic thing that man ever created,” said Charles Levesque, 93, who served in the Pacific theatre. “Our enemies now are our friends, and our friends are our enemies. It doesn’t make any sense.” "|"‘Never be forgotten’: Nations honour veterans, memory of fallen troops on D-Day anniversary"|"2019-06-06T10:15:38-0400"|"Second World War,D-Day,Justin Trudeau,D-Day anniversary,Juno Beach,WWII,World War II,normandy,world,france,troops,people,water,britain,beach",

The number of Indians killed in the crash Thursday night in the United Arab Emirates could increase further, Indian consular officials said. The bus drove straight into a low-clearance sign in Dubai’s Rashidiya neighbourhood around 6 p.m. The sign, which hangs over a car-only off-ramp of the Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Road, a major highway in Dubai, smashed through the driver’s side of the bus. Mwasalat, a government-owned bus company in Oman, said the crash involved a bus on its Muscat-to-Dubai route. It separately identified the dead Friday night as 11 Indians, two Pakistanis, one Irish citizen and an Omani, with two others not immediately identified. The discrepancy between the company’s figures and the Indian consular officials could not be immediately explained. Indian consular officials published a list naming all the dead they had identified. Pakistani consular officials in Dubai declined to immediately comment. The Irish Embassy in Abu Dhabi said it was aware of reports of the death and providing consular assistance. Among the 31 people on board were also citizens of Bangladesh, Germany and the Philippines, the bus company said in a statement. It added that seven passengers remained hospitalized, with one in critical condition. Eight others had been discharged. Mwasalat said it would suspend its service to Dubai for the immediate future. It added it was co-operating with investigators in Dubai looking into what caused the crash. Dubai police said the dead included different nationalities, without elaborating. At least three others were injured in the crash. “Sometimes a minor error or negligence during driving leads to serious consequences,” police said on Twitter, without elaborating on the cause of the crash.

"250"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-parting-the-red-sea-why-the-chinese-and-us-armies-are-fortifying/"|"Geoffrey York"|"From the edge of a cargo port at the southern entrance to the Red Sea, a visitor can peer over a high wall and gain a glimpse of the future: China’s first overseas military base. Access to the 36-hectare Chinese base is tightly controlled. From a distance, only a huddle of grey and beige buildings with Asian-style roofs is visible. But beneath the barracks is a maze of subterranean structures, connected with tunnels. In total, the base has room for up to 10,000 Chinese soldiers. If there is a military front line in the growing global tensions between China and the United States, it is here in Djibouti, a small country of less than a million people on one of the world’s most strategically important sites. In this hot and arid corner of the Horn of Africa, thousands of U.S. and Chinese soldiers are deployed at heavily guarded bases just a few kilometres from each other. Djibouti dominates access to Bab el-Mandeb (the “Gate of Tears” in Arabic), a crucial choke point at the entrance to the Red Sea, only 25 kilometres wide at its narrowest point. It commands access to the Suez Canal shipping route that connects Asia, Europe and the Middle East, and it is the only place in the world where Beijing and Washington have large-scale military bases so close together. Tensions between the two rival superpowers are already rising. Beijing has complained of spying by low-flying U.S. aircraft near the Chinese base, while Washington alleges that the Chinese have taken unauthorized photos of U.S. warships and even shined lasers into the eyes of U.S. pilots to blind them temporarily. “It’s a cat-and-mouse game,” says Ibrahim Ahmed Djama, an official at the Djibouti Ports & Free Zones Authority, which operates a major port adjacent to the Chinese base. In a vigorous but covert lobbying campaign, senior U.S. officials tried to persuade Djibouti to deny permission for the Chinese base – but the government refused to bow to the pressure, according to Djibouti officials in interviews with The Globe and Mail. The Chinese base opened in mid-2017 with a flag-raising ceremony by People’s Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers. Since then, the base has become an object of fascination for military analysts. They pore over satellite photos, trying to calculate the capacity of the hangars, barracks, naval piers and an estimated 23,000 square metres of underground structures. Troops from the Chinese base have already held live-fire combat drills in Djibouti with machine guns, heavy artillery, sniper rifles and armoured vehicles – the largest-scale exercises it has ever conducted on foreign soil. Many countries, indeed, are jostling for room in Djibouti. This is the new Casablanca that has become a magnet for international espionage and intrigue. It contains perhaps the world’s biggest concentration of military bases in such a confined space. The French Foreign Legion, Japan, Germany, Spain and Italy are among those with a military presence in Djibouti. The Japanese base, adjacent to the U.S. base, is the first Japanese overseas base since the Second World War. Japan has expanded the base’s size and activities in recent years. Chinese media reported in 2017 that a Japanese naval ship had covertly sent frogmen to approach a Chinese warship as it docked in Djibouti. Chinese soldiers used lights and verbal warnings to chase them away, the report said. China is spending US$20-million annually to lease the site for its military base. Satellite images show that the Chinese base includes a tarmac for helicopters and drones, repair facilities for commercial and naval ships, storage rooms for arsenals of weapons and a nine-metre-wide security wall around it. “It’s a fortress,” says Mr. Djama as he drives past a vantage point where the Chinese base can be seen. Just 12 km from the Chinese base is its main rival: Camp Lemonnier, opened in 2003 and now the biggest U.S. military base in Africa, with about 4,500 troops stationed in it. Beijing has complained that the Pentagon uses the base to gather intelligence on its Chinese rival. “That’s what the Chinese are claiming – they complained several times to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the Americans were overflying their base with helicopters and drones,” said Aboubaker Omar Hadi, chairman of the ports and free-trade authority in Djibouti. He agrees that the Chinese and U.S. troops are in close enough proximity to trigger an accidental conflict. “It could happen, it could happen,” he told The Globe in an interview. “But I think it can be controlled,” he said. “If they want to fight, they have plenty of places in the world to do it. Here they are too close. We put them too close to fight.”     The Djibouti government has felt obliged to remind the Chinese and Americans of the need to respect their host’s rules. “The position of my government is: ‘Don’t forget, both of you are guests,’ ” Mr. Hadi said. “They understand very well what that means.” But if the Americans are guests, they can be demanding ones. Djibouti officials tell the story of how high-level U.S. officials put intense pressure on the tiny country when they heard that Russia was seeking permission to open a military base here. “The Americans heard rumours that the Russians are coming,” recalled one official, who didn’t want to be identified by The Globe to preserve diplomatic relations. “They came here and met our President and said, ‘Please don’t do that.’ He said, ‘Okay, I’m a friend of the USA, so I’m not allowing Russia to come.’ A few months later, the Chinese came, and again the Americans complained. And the President said, ‘Hey, we agreed on Russia. You said only Russia. You can’t tell me not to accept the Chinese.’ ” After losing the battle to prevent the Chinese base from opening, the United States invested heavily in Camp Lemonnier, extending its lease on the site, doubling its lease payments to US$63-million annually and announcing more than US$1-billion in upgrades. The Pentagon has used the base for hundreds of drone attacks on terrorist targets in Somalia. Washington has continued to complain vociferously about the Chinese base. President Donald Trump’s national-security adviser, John Bolton, alleges that China used “military-grade lasers” from its Djibouti base to “target and distract U.S. pilots” in 10 separate incidents. “Two of our American pilots suffered eye injuries from exposure to laser beams,” he said in a December speech. The same alarmist tone fuels the rhetoric of other U.S. officials. General Thomas Waldhauser, head of the U.S. military command for Africa, told a U.S. Senate committee that he is worried about a possible Chinese takeover of one of Djibouti’s biggest ports, the Doraleh Container Terminal, adjacent to the Chinese base, which was nationalized by the government last year. The U.S. general estimated that 98 per cent of supplies for U.S. military operations in Eastern Africa go through the port. “If we were denied access or had limited access, it would have a significant impact on our activities in East Africa,” he said, describing the port access as a “strategic imperative” for the United States. Mr. Bolton said a Chinese takeover of the container terminal would shift the “balance of power in the Horn of Africa” and would endanger the Pentagon’s ability to “protect the American people” from terrorist organizations in Eastern Africa. China and Djibouti have scoffed at the U.S. allegations. China has formally denied the laser-attack allegation, and senior Djibouti officials have complained of “misinformation” by the United States on the port issue. “I think the American politicians are manipulated, they are given wrong information, they are far away from Africa and Djibouti,” Mr. Hadi said. Yet he also acknowledges that the Djibouti government might allow Chinese investors to win a share of the container terminal – perhaps as much as 33 per cent, he says. (One of his aides later rushed after The Globe journalist to urge that this comment be deleted from the interview.) Beijing has been unimpressed by the U.S. efforts to halt China’s expansion in Djibouti. “The U.S. government needs to abandon its old mentality of regarding Africa as its own sphere of interest and trying to drive out others from there,” Chinese researcher Shen Shiwei wrote in the state-owned Global Times newspaper after Mr. Bolton’s speech. But there is little doubt that China sees its base in Djibouti as the first of many bases worldwide, under a doctrine known as “the String of Pearls” – an emerging network of Chinese ports and bases from South Asia to Africa. The strategic port of Walvis Bay, on the Atlantic coast of Namibia, is often reported to be the next Chinese naval base in Africa, although there has been no official confirmation. “We will be gradually moving from depending on dispatching supply vessels to setting up overseas bases,” said Li Chunpang, political commissar of the Chinese military base in Djibouti, in a recent interview with Chinese state television.     China has dramatically expanded its military presence in Africa in recent years, launching a growing number of naval patrols, military training programs, exchanges, port visits, anti-piracy operations and joint exercises. Last year alone, the PLA conducted drills in Nigeria, Cameroon, Ghana and Gabon. It has sharply increased its contributions to United Nations peacekeeping operations, sending about 2,400 Chinese troops to serve in UN missions in Africa. China originally portrayed its base in Djibouti as merely a “logistics” base to support its peacekeepers and anti-piracy operations. But it is increasingly clear that the base is much more than that. It protects Chinese interests in the region, including the crucial sea lanes that carry half of China’s oil supplies. “The Djibouti base enables the PLA to project force and protect Chinese citizens, supply chains and other interests in Africa and along its ‘Maritime Silk Road’ across the Indian Ocean,” wrote Canadian analyst Michael Kovrig last October in a commentary for the International Crisis Group, only a few weeks before he was arrested by Chinese police during the diplomatic dispute between Canada and China. China, like the United States, has an unofficial purpose for its military base: to expand its geopolitical influence in a global hot spot, at the intersection of Africa and the Middle East. And in a region where thousands of Chinese citizens are working on construction and engineering projects, China wants to demonstrate that it can protect and rescue its citizens if they are threatened with violence – as its troops did in the plot of the hugely popular 2017 Chinese action movie Wolf Warrior 2. “Set in a nameless African country that descends into chaos, it closes with the hubristic message that China’s government will protect its citizens wherever they go,” Mr. Kovrig noted. China’s military operations in Djibouti are, in some ways, a response to the Pentagon’s expansion across Africa. Thousands of U.S. troops are stationed across the continent. Researchers have found U.S. military activity in at least 49 of the 54 African countries in recent years, including special-forces operations, military exercises and training missions. Since the beginning of Mr. Trump’s presidency in 2017, the Pentagon has openly declared that it is entering an era of “great power competition” with China and Russia. This includes a rivalry for influence in Africa, where the Pentagon is increasingly worried about terrorism. The United States has used its Djibouti-based drones to escalate its military strikes against al-Shabaab, the Islamist militia in Somalia, and it is determined to prevent any Chinese threat to its Djibouti base. All of this has Djibouti watching the Chinese and Americans carefully. “We are happy to have our friends here, but our intention is not to suffer from our generosity,” Djibouti’s Finance Minister Ilyas Moussa Dawaleh told The Globe in an interview. “Are different powers conflicting in Djibouti? They should not. It’s not in our interest. And it’s not in their interest either. The two superpowers have more to gain from the stability of this region than from creating unnecessary conflict.” "|"Parting the Red Sea: Why the Chinese and U.S. armies are fortifying this tiny African country"|"2019-06-06T18:53:10-0400"|"djibouti,china military base djibouti,us military base djibouti,china us middle east,china us red sea,sino-american relations,china in africa,china foreign policy africa,us foreign policy africa,base,china,United States,africa,access,russia", 
"251"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-new-orleans-rb-musician-dr-john-dies-at-77/"|"Cain Burdeau Kevin McGill"|"Dr. John, the New Orleans singer and piano player who blended black and white musical styles with a hoodoo-infused stage persona and gravelly bayou drawl, died Thursday, his family said. He was 77. In a statement released through his publicist, the family said Dr. John, who was born Mac Rebennack, died “toward the break of day” of a heart attack. They did not say where he died or give other details. He had not been seen in public much since late 2017, when he cancelled several gigs. He had been resting at his New Orleans area home, publicist Karen Beninato said last year in an interview. Memorial arrangements were being planned. “The family thanks all whom have shared his unique musical journey, and requests privacy at this time,” the statement said. “Dr. John was a true Louisiana legend,” Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said in a statement. “He showed the world Louisiana’s rich musical heritage, and his passion for music has left a mark on the industry unlike any other.” Drummer Ringo Starr was among the first musicians to weigh in on Twitter. “God bless Dr. John peace and love to all his family I love the doctor peace and love,” the Beatles legend tweeted. Fellow New Orleans singer Irma Thomas said he was loved around the world. “He was just a mystical person,” Thomas told WVUE television when asked what made his music special. “He did what he liked best and was very unique with his style.” His spooky 1968 debut Gris-Gris combined rhythm ‘n blues with psychedelic rock and startled listeners with its sinister implications of other-worldly magic, employing a piano style both rollicking and haunting. He later had a Top 10 hit with Right Place, Wrong Time, collaborated with numerous top-tier rockers, won multiple Grammy awards and was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. A white man who found a home among black New Orleans musicians, he first entered the music scene when he accompanied his father, who ran a record shop and also fixed the P.A. systems at New Orleans bars. As a teenager in the 1950s, he played guitar and keyboards in a string of bands and made the legendary studio of Cosimo Matassa his second home, Rebennack said in his 1994 memoir, Under a Hoodoo Moon. He got into music full-time after dropping out of high school, became acquainted with drugs and petty crime and lived a fast-paced life. His gigs ranged from strip clubs to auditoriums, roadhouses and chicken shacks. The ring finger of Rebennack’s left hand was blown off in a shooting incident in 1961 in Jacksonville, Florida. He blamed Jim Garrison, the JFK conspiracy theorist and a tough-on-crime New Orleans district attorney, for driving him out of his beloved city in the early 1960s. Garrison went after prostitutes, bars and all-night music venues. The underworld sweep put Rebennack in prison. At that time, he was a respected session musician who had played on classic recordings by R&B mainstays like Professor Longhair and Irma Thomas, but he was also a heroin addict. After his release from federal prison in Fort Worth, Texas, at age 24, Rebennack joined friend and mentor Harold Battiste who had left New Orleans to make music in Los Angeles. Rebennack, who’d long had a fascination with occult mysticism and voodoo, told Battiste about creating a musical personality out of Dr. John, a male version of Marie Laveau, the voodoo queen. In his memoir, Rebennack said, he drew inspiration from New Orleans folklore about a root doctor who flourished in the mid-1800s. Battiste, in a 2005 interview, recalled, “It was really done sort of tongue-in-cheek.” But Dr. John was born and Rebennack got his first personal recordings done in what became Gris-Gris, a 1968 classic of underground American music. In the years that followed, he played with The Grateful Dead, appeared with The Band in director Martin Scorsese’s The Last Waltz documentary, jammed on The Rolling Stones’ Exile on Main Street album and collaborated with countless others — among them Earl King, Van Morrison and James Booker.

Baldor Mari Yamaguchi"|"The U.S. and Russia accused each other of unsafe actions on Friday after an American guided-missile cruiser and a Russian destroyer came within 50 metres of each other in the Philippine Sea. Acting Defence Secretary Patrick Shanahan told reporters that the U.S. will file a formal diplomatic complaint about the incident and will have military to military conversations with the Russians. He added that the encounter will not deter the U.S. from conducting naval operations. The U.S. 7th Fleet said the Russian destroyer put the safety of the USS Chancellorsville and its crew at risk, forcing it to reverse all engines at full throttle to avoid a collision. No one was injured, and the ships never came into contact, said Navy Cdr. Clay Doss, a spokesman for the Japan-based 7th Fleet. An American helicopter was preparing to land on the Chancellorsville, which was travelling on a steady course, when the Russian destroyer, travelling behind the U.S. ship, started moving faster and approached as close as 15-30 metres, the 7th Fleet said in a statement. “We consider Russia’s actions during this interaction as unsafe and unprofessional and not in accordance with the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGS), ‘Rules of the Road,’ and internationally recognized maritime customs,” the statement said. It was the first such incident involving warships in the region since September, when the Chinese warship Luoyang manoeuvred close to the USS Decatur, a Navy destroyer, in the South China Sea, an incident the U.S. also labelled unprofessional and unsafe. The U.S. at the time said the Chinese ship came within 41 metres of the American ship, forcing it to manoeuvre out of the way. The Chinese said the Luoyang had been deployed to drive the U.S. vessel away from islands that China claims as its own. The U.S. also has repeatedly complained in recent years that Russian planes have flown dangerously close to American aircraft, and the two nations routinely shadow each other in international airspace. In this latest incident, in open ocean northeast of the Philippines, the Russian military accused the Chancellorsville of making a dangerous manoeuvre by crossing the path of the Russian destroyer Admiral Vinogradov. The U.S. said the incident happened in the Philippine Sea, while the Russians said it was in the East China Sea, which is further west and closer to China. The Russian military said in a statement that the U.S. cruiser “suddenly changed direction and crossed the path of Admiral Vinogradov just 50 metres away,” forcing the crew of the Russian ship to make a quick manoeuvre to avoid a collision. It said its navy sent a radio message in protest. With U.S.-Russian relations at post-Cold War lows over the Ukrainian crisis, the war in Syria and Moscow’s meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the Russian and U.S. militaries have frequently exchanged accusations of what they describe as unsafe manoeuvres by the other side’s warplanes and navy ships.

Authorities didn’t identify the victims in the attack, which took place at about 2:30 a.m. on May 30. But Melania Geymonat posted an image on her Facebook page showing her bloodied face and that of her girlfriend’s. Geymonat said in the post that they were on the upper deck of the bus when a gang of “hooligans” threw coins at them and demanded that they kiss. The couple were punched and robbed before the attackers escaped. Police said both women were taken to the hospital with facial injuries.

"254"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-un-aid-agencies-say-four-million-people-have-fled-crisis-in-venezuela/"|"Stephanie Nebehay"|"Four million Venezuelan refugees and migrants have fled economic and humanitarian crisis in their homeland, all but 700,000 of them since the end of 2015, UN aid agencies said on Friday. The OPEC member’s imploding economy has brought widespread shortages of basic foods and medicines, while political hostilities have led to waves of fatal violence. The crisis has deepened since the United States imposed sanctions, including on the pivotal oil industry, in an effort to oust leftist President Nicolas Maduro in favour of opposition leader Juan Guaido. “The pace of the outflow from Venezuela has been staggering,” the UN refugee agency UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said in a joint statement. The previous UN count was 3.7 million and the “alarming” new figure highlights the urgent need to support host countries, mainly in Latin America – led by Colombia with 1.3 million and followed by Peru, Chile, Ecuador, Brazil and Argentina, it said. Peru’s President on Thursday vowed to continue deporting Venezuelans with criminal records as long as necessary, part of a toughening stance toward the migrants. Some 3.2 million children in Venezuela – or one in three – need humanitarian assistance, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) said in a separate statement on Friday. Mortality rates among under five-year-olds doubled from 14 per 1,000 live births in 2010/2011 to 31 per 1,000 live births in 2017, UNICEF spokesman Christophe Boulierac told a briefing. Some 190 suspected cases of diphtheria and 558 suspected cases of measles have been recorded in Venezuela this year, he said, noting that measles weakens a child’s immune system. UNICEF has provided 55 tonnes of health supplies to 25 hospitals in Caracas and other states this year, including midwifery kits, antibiotics and malaria treatments, he added. “Unfortunately we are barely scratching the surface – millions of children need to be immunized, go to school, drink safe water and feel protected,” Mr. Boulierac said. Dozens of nations around the world now recognize opposition leader Guaido as interim president, saying Mr. Maduro rigged a 2018 election and is behaving like a dictator. But Mr. Guaido has been unable to remove Mr. Maduro, who still has the backing of the top military brass and accuses his foes of conniving with Washington to bring about a coup. U.S. President Donald Trump’s strong backing for Mr. Guaido has not tipped the balance, and the sanctions have failed to dislodge Mr. Maduro while exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. One study in April, co-authored by U.S. economists Jeffrey Sachs and Mark Weisbrot, blamed sanctions for causing more deaths and disproportionately hitting the most vulnerable. “We find that the sanctions have inflicted, and increasingly inflict, very serious harm to human life and health, including an estimated more than 40,000 deaths from 2017–2018,” they said, arguing they were illegal under international law.

Ashiqul Alam, 22, from Jackson Heights in the city’s Queens borough, was charged with illegally acquiring firearms as part of the attack plan, federal officials said. U.S. Magistrate Judge Cheryl Pollak ordered Alam detained without bail after a brief court hearing in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn on Friday. His next court appearance is set for June 21 at 11 a.m. (1300 GMT). Alam’s lawyer, James Darrow, had asked for his client to be released on $200,000 bond, under home confinement and with an ankle monitor. He said Alam lived with his parents, who were both in the courtroom and prepared to sign the bond. Alam was arrested on Thursday after receiving two Glock 19 nine-millimeter semi-automatic pistols with their serial numbers stripped off from undercover law enforcement officers, according to a complaint unsealed on Friday in Brooklyn federal court. During meetings with an undercover federal agent, Alam expressed support for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York as well as the militant group Islamic State, according to the complaint. He also discussed using an explosive suicide vest in an attack. “As alleged, Ashiqul Alam bought illegal weapons as part of his plan to kill law enforcement officers and civilians in a terrorist attack on Times Square,” U.S. Attorney Richard Donoghue, whose office brought the charges, said in a statement. Alam had proposed an attack either in Times Square or an attack in Washington to kill a U.S. government official, the complaint said. In April, Alam met the undercover officer at a shooting range in Pennsylvania, according to the complaint. While driving to the range, Alam told the officer that he had scheduled an appointment for laser vision correction, the complaint said. When the officer asked him why, Alam said he was concerned his glasses would fall off during the attack and he would accidentally shoot the officer, and joked that the media would call him the “Looney Toons Terrorist” or “Blind Terrorist,” according to the complaint. Alam is a rising senior at John Jay College and has two jobs, his lawyer said at the hearing. When asked about Alam, a spokesman for John Jay College said it does not release information about individual students. Times Square, with its millions of visitors each year, is often called the crossroads of the world, and has been targeted by at least two bombers in recent years, despite the presence of heavily armed police. On May 1, 2010, police thwarted an attempted car bomb in Times Square, defusing a crude device made out of firecrackers and propane gas tanks. A Pakistani-born U.S. citizen pleaded guilty to the plot, admitting that he had received bomb-making training from the Pakistani Taliban and that the group, known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan had funded the plot. He was sentenced to life in prison. In December 2017, a Bangladeshi man set off a homemade pipe bomb strapped to his body in a crowded underground pedestrian tunnel near Times Square. The man, Akayed Ullah, was convicted of six criminal counts, including use of a weapon of mass destruction and support of a terrorist organization. Kate Fan, a 28-year-old charity worker visiting from Guangzhou, China, said she had heard about the incident but still felt safe. “We hear a lot of stories about New York being unsafe, but we feel like people sometimes exaggerate safety issues,” she said.

The cause of the blast wasn’t immediately known. “So far, it is unclear what exploded and what the location for the blast was,” police spokesman Bjorn Oberg told a news conference, adding forensic teams were still at work. Police had no suspect and no one has been arrested. Kim Berg, a spokesman for the region’s hospitals, said two people remain hospitalized in stable condition. Victims mainly suffered cuts from splintered and flying glass or were treated for shock. The explosion blew out dozens of windows and destroyed balconies in the buildings in central Linkoping, about 175 kilometres southwest of Stockholm. One of the buildings has five stories, while the other has four. A total of 109 apartments had their windows and balconies damaged, said Johan Edwardsson of the Linkoping municipality, adding “many won’t be able to move home tonight.” Police said a bomb squad had been deployed to the area as a precaution after the blast, which occurred shortly after 9 a.m. The area was sealed off by police. “As for now, we don’t have any information to believe this is terror-related,” Mr. Oberg said, adding there were not aware of any threat.

"257"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-british-pm-candidate-boris-johnson-wins-bid-to-stop-court-case-over/"|"Michael Holden"|"Judges at London’s High Court on Friday threw out an attempt to prosecute Boris Johnson, the front-runner to succeed Theresa May as Britain’s prime minister, for allegedly lying about the financial benefits of Brexit during the 2016 EU referendum campaign. Last week, a magistrate agreed to issue summonses for Johnson to face charges of misconduct in public office over a claim emblazoned on his bright red “Leave” campaign bus that Britain would be £350-million ( $592-million) a week better off outside the European Union. Opponents had argued that the slogan was deliberately misleading and it became symbolic of the divisions caused by the referendum, which saw Britons vote 52-48 per cent to leave the EU. Marcus Ball, 29, who described himself as a social enterprise founder, brought the private prosecution against Mr. Johnson in February which led to last week’s decision. But at a judicial review hearing on Friday at the High Court, Mr. Johnson’s lawyer, Adrian Darbishire, said the magistrate had either erred in law or provided the wrong legal test in allowing the case to go ahead. Mr. Darbishire said the only rational conclusion was that the case was politically motivated and therefore without merit. The High Court judges agreed the summonses should be quashed, saying they would give their reasons at a later date. The flamboyant Mr. Johnson, who did not attend Friday’s hearing, is the favourite among Conservative lawmakers hoping to replace Ms. May as party leader and therefore prime minister. The case could potentially have damaged his bid to replace Ms. May, who stepped down as Conservative leader on Friday although she will remain prime minister until a successor is selected. Friday’s challenge, filed in the former foreign minister’s full name – Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson – examined whether a politician could be accused of criminal misconduct over statements made during political campaigning. “Standing on the hustings is not the exercise of state power, and doing something naughty on the hustings is not an abuse of state power,” said Mr. Darbishire. He said it was not for the police or juries to stray into the sphere of political debate and that it was for the electorate to decide on the truth of claims. Mr. Ball’s overt opposition to Brexit and desire to have it stopped also showed the case had no legal merit, Mr. Darbishire added. “This is realistically, plainly speaking, a political prosecution,” he said. After the verdict, Mr. Ball, who has raised more than £350,000 through crowdfunding to pursue the prosecution, said he would mull whether to appeal, saying his case was not about stopping Brexit. “I will not give up until I believe that all possible options are exhausted,” he said. “If you are an elected representative and you are talking about people’s money … it’s not correct for a member of Parliament to lie to everybody about that.” As for the £350-million claim itself, Mr. Johnson’s lawyers said he denied acting dishonestly in any way and the figure remained contentious. “It is still being adhered to today,” Mr. Darbishire said.

"258"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-in-pakistan-a-transgender-tv-anchor-embodies-a-countrys-changing/"|"Salmaan Farooqui"|"Marvia Malik and a group of her friends are lounging in her room as she gets her makeup done before a photo shoot for a Pakistani fashion brand, and a makeup artist has already been working on Ms. Malik’s face for an hour. When asked how long it usually takes, a friend in the room can’t help but make a joke. “If we’re talking about Marvia, then at least two hours,” she says, as the whole room bursts into laughter. Ms. Malik is used to life in front of a camera. Last year, she made her debut as Pakistan’s first openly transgender TV anchor. The apartment, where a group of her transgender friends live, is a safe space in a country where transgender rights are both officially supported and regularly violated. With her face on both television news and fashion advertisements, Ms. Malik is one of the most visible transgender activists in the country. A government report by the Punjab Social Protection Agency last year found that transgender people are often treated abusively by law enforcement, face public humiliation and are often victims of physical and sexual assault. It means Ms. Malik doesn’t always feel safe. “Because I’m on TV, people can recognize me,” says Ms. Malik. “It makes me uneasy, because transgender people are still victims of crime in Pakistan.” The transgender rights movement in the South Asian country is caught between a government that is publicly supportive of their rights, and a significant portion of the population that is intolerant. Last month marks one year since Pakistan passed the Transgender Persons Act, a piece of legislation that Amnesty International called “one of the most progressive laws of its kind in the world.” It was the culmination of years of slow change in attitude in the government sector and multiple fatwas supporting transgender rights, such as one religious declaration that outlined the right of a transgender person to marry. It has made Pakistan among a minority of countries that legally protect a person’s right to self-identify their gender and protects them from discrimination in the workplace and rental market. Yet two days before the bill was introduced, Amnesty International and local media reported on the death of a transgender dancer performing at a wedding, who was allegedly shot for not having change for a bill worth less than $10. An estimated 500 transgender people have been killed since 2015, according to the Law and Justice Committee of Pakistan. Ms. Malik had a difficult home life before she was abandoned as a teenager. Now, she has a job, a support system within her community of friends, and her family is coming around to accepting her. “Wherever I’ve gone so far when it comes to work, I’ve never had to deal with much discrimination – I’m lucky about this,” says Ms. Malik, who says violent intolerance is still the norm for poor transgender people, and that many transgender people are refused work. Activists say Pakistan’s pervasive poverty problems and a low literacy rate are contributing factors. The transgender rights movement in Pakistan is unusually powerful because of how visible transgender people are as a part of society. That visibility goes as far back as the 1600s, to the Mughal empire, when transgender people played a valuable role as messengers between royal men and women. That history has played a part in other South Asian countries as well. In Bangladesh, transgender people won the right to vote and run in Parliament this year. In India, a bill has recognized transgender people as equal since 2014, although a rights bill in 2018 was criticized by the trans community as violating their rights and barring them from self-identifying gender. “In other countries, you don’t see as many transgender people in everyday life,” said Kami Sid, a transgender model and actor who became a well-known activist after featuring prominently in advertising for Pakistani apparel brands. “In Pakistan and India, we have a strong trans culture and history. We are very visible.” Still, a large part of Pakistani society only sees transgender people as beggars, dancers and workers in the sex trade. Many people only interact with transgender people as entertainers at weddings and celebrations such as the birth of a child or during fortune-tellings. The stigma follows transgender people trying to build lives around other careers. “In my job interview, they said, ‘transgender people generally dance and sing, so why do you want to be a news anchor?’ ” Ms. Malik said. She says that her company was understanding after she explained the rights movement, and the media industry has been very inclusive. Her channel, Kohenoor TV, reached seventh in viewer ratings on her first day as an anchor – a high achievement for a country with more than 30 news channels competing for viewers. “People were curious,” Ms. Malik said. Activist groups say the next step for transgender rights in Pakistan is to establish support systems for transgender people trying to find work in industries that are new to them, such as Ms. Malik’s TV reporting. The community has increased its visibility over the past few years, with as many as 13 transgender candidates running for office in the 2018 general elections. That same year, Ms. Sid featured in an award-winning short film, Rani. And earlier this year the Sindh Police, in Pakistan’s second largest province, discussed introducing a quota for transgender officers. “We still have problems now, but we have organizations that give us more power as well,” said Saima Butt, a social activist at Khawaja Sira Society, a transgender rights NGO in the bustling city of Lahore. “When people see that there are educated transgender people who are organized, people stop opposing us.” Ms. Butt says her family eventually accepted her, despite carrying a scar on her brow from the beatings she was given. Others have not been so lucky. “Their families shoot them, sometimes they shoot them in the legs to disable them, they are confined to their homes, sometimes they are forced into marriages, and there are thousands of cases of their hair being cut,” Ms. Butt said. But Ms. Malik has hope: Transgender children, she says, are now seeing other transgender people not just as members of the poorest classes, but as reporters, aspiring politicians, police officers and activists. “Our culture is a very strong culture, and it goes from generation to generation. It cannot be erased.” "|"In Pakistan, a transgender TV anchor embodies a country’s changing attitudes"|"2019-06-07T18:27:56-0400"|"transgender laws pakistan,transgender tv anchors,transgender activists pakistan,Marvia Malik,Punjab Social Protection Agency,Transgender Persons Act,Amnesty International,fatwas,Law and Justice Committee of Pakistan,Kami Sid,Kohenoor TV,people,pakistan,rights,room",

Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, a young reformist who assumed office a year ago, has been at the centre of high-profile diplomatic efforts in the East Africa region, including a surprise restoration of diplomatic ties between Ethiopia and rival Eritrea. He arrived in Sudan as the crisis following the overthrow of long-time autocrat Omar al-Bashir turned increasingly violent. The military removed Mr. al-Bashir from power in April after months of mass protests, but has resisted the protesters’ demands for an immediate handover of power to civilians. On Monday, security forces violently dispersed the main sit-in outside the military headquarters in Khartoum, and similar clashes have erupted in other cities and towns. The African Union, based in Ethiopia, suspended Sudan on Thursday and threatened “punitive sanctions” if the military doesn’t quickly relinquish power. Mr. Abiy met Friday with General Abdel-Fattah Burhan, the head of the ruling council, as well as protest leaders before leaving Khartoum in the evening. In a phone interview with Saudi-owned satellite channel al-Arabiya, protest leader Gaafar Hassan declined to discuss the meeting in detail, saying a news conference would be held later, but ruled out any “direct” or “indirect” talks with the military. “The [military] council has lost its political as well as its ethical legitimacy and we cannot deal with it, but we call for its ouster,” he said. In a statement shared by the military council, the Ethiopian Prime Minister called on Sudanese to show “courage” and move quickly toward a democratic, inclusive transition. Political parties should not be held hostage to prejudices of the past, he added. There was no immediate comment from the office of the Ethiopian Prime Minister and it was not known what demands were made during the talks or what will happen next. The Sudan Doctors’ Central Committee, one of the protest groups, said at least 113 people have been killed and more than 500 wounded since Monday. It says more than 40 bodies have been pulled from the Nile River in Khartoum and taken away by security forces since the violence erupted. The protesters have blamed much of the violence on the Rapid Support Forces, a paramilitary group that grew out of the notorious Janjaweed militias mobilized by Mr. al-Bashir during the Darfur conflict in the early 2000s. The militias were widely accused of crimes against humanity, and Mr. al-Bashir – now jailed in Khartoum – was indicted on charges of genocide. The head of the RSF, General Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo – better known as Hemedti – was “conspicuously absent” in photos shared by the Ethiopian prime minister’s office, according to Rashid Abdi, a former project director with the International Crisis Group. “That is significant,” he wrote on Twitter. “Lends credence to reports of push to sideline the RSF commander.” In a statement released late Thursday, protest leaders demanded that the RSF be dissolved and its weapons handed over to the army. Amnesty International said the RSF should return to their barracks and be barred from any law enforcement activities. “The senseless killing of protesters must be stopped immediately, and those responsible for the bloodbath, including at command level, must be held fully accountable for their dreadful actions,” said Kumi Naidoo, secretary general of the London-based rights group. After Mr. al-Bashir’s ouster, the Ethiopian prime minister had congratulated the Sudanese people for their “resilience in leading change” toward a democratic Sudan. He met with Gen. Burhan during the general’s visit to Addis Ababa last week, when he committed to “non-interference” in the situation but urged political inclusiveness. Mr. Abiy is seen as having good relations with the West, which has cheered his reforms, as well as with powerful Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia, that have influence over Sudan’s military. Awol Allo, a lecturer in law at Keele University in Britain and an Africa analyst, said Abiy stands a “much better chance” than anyone else in bringing the two sides together. Mr. Abiy “brings a lot to the table, from his own experience of leading a complex transition to a massive amount of positive energy, and the weight of Ethiopia’s power within the region,” the analyst said. Meanwhile, the UN health agency said Friday it is gravely concerned over the targeting of patients, medical staff and facilities during the crackdown. Security forces are making “incursions into Khartoum hospitals,” the World Health Organization said, forcing shutdowns of emergency and health services. It said five patients and medical workers have been wounded. The agency said tent clinics set up to treat wounded protesters have been set ablaze and destroyed, medical equipment has been looted, and health care workers assaulted.

"260"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-russian-anti-corruption-journalist-detained-in-moscow-accused-of-drug/"|"Nataliya Vasilyeva"|"A prominent Russian investigative journalist has been charged with drug dealing after four grams of the synthetic stimulant mephedrone were found in his backpack, Moscow police said Friday. Ivan Golunov, who works for the independent website Meduza, was stopped by police in central Moscow on Thursday afternoon. Police also said that more drugs were found at his home. Meduza’s director general, Galina Timchenko, told The Associated Press that Golunov, one of the most prominent investigative journalists in Russia, was beaten while in detention and denied medical tests that would show he has not handled drugs. Timchenko said she has photos that show the impact on the left side of his face. Moscow police denied the accusations of beating. Golunov is due to appear in court on Saturday. His lawyer said that his client was not allowed to contact his family or lawyer for 12 hours after he was detained. Golunov’s colleagues and other journalists went to the headquarters of the Moscow police Friday afternoon to protest what many saw as blatant retribution for a journalist’s work. An organization that tracks politically connected arrests, OVD-Info, said 11 journalists were detained at the protest, but later released without charges. In the evening, a queue of demonstrators assembled outside the headquarters, each in turn holding a sign in support of Golunov. Single protest pickets are permitted without prior authorization under Russian law. Golunov, 36, has recently received threats linked to a story he was pursuing, Timchenko said. “We are convinced that Ivan Golunov is innocent,” Timchenko’s Meduza said in a statement. “What’s more, we have reasons to believe that Golunov is being persecuted for his journalism. We know that Vanya (Golunov) has been receiving threats in recent months, and we know which particular unfinished story they relate to.” Meduza was founded in 2014 by a group of journalists who left a popular Russian news website after their editor was fired. The website is based in Riga, Latvia, as the journalists fear that an increasing wave of media censorship and restrictive internet laws in Russia make any editorial office there vulnerable to government pressure. While most of Meduza’s staff is based in Riga, special correspondents like Golunov are working in Russia. Moscow police attached nine photos to its statement about Golunov’s detention, some of which showed bags with white substance and big empty bottles suggestive of a makeshift drugs lab at his home. A friend of the journalist, Alexander Urzhanov, told the AP that he had been to Golunov’s home and that the pictures could not have been taken at the tiny apartment. “What has been published doesn’t look like an apartment: there’s a cement floor, wood on the walls,” he said. “Vanya’s apartment had white walls. I can’t imagine all of the stuff in those pictures can be fitted in the apartment that I have been to so that no one would notice.” Moscow police later amended its statement and deleted the pictures. Police said that those pictures were related to a drugs raid in the Moscow region, and that they were looking into possible links between the drug dealers’ group there and Golunov. Golunov rose to prominence in recent years with his corruption investigations into Moscow’s city government and the crime-ridden funeral market. Peers described Golunov as one of Russia’s most dogged investigative reporters and expressed dismay at the circumstances of the case. “This is totally incredible and is not in his character that he would give up what he’s been doing and start making money in this way,” Alexander Baunov of the Moscow Carnegie Center told the AP. Baunov has known Golunov since 2004 when they worked at the same publishing house. The allegations of a thriving drugs business run by an investigative reporter stunned Russia’s journalism community, long accustomed to arbitrary detentions and violence, and raised concerns about police actions. “Golunov’s detention is not so much about the crackdown on journalists,” prominent TV journalist Alexei Pivovarov tweeted. “It’s about the fact that they can come after anyone. Because it’s dead easy to find a drugs lab at your place.” Amnesty International also raised concerns about Golunov’s detention. “Everything indicates that the authorities are planting drugs on their targets to shut them up with a jail sentence,” Nataliya Zviagina, the director of Amnesty’s Russia office, said in a statement. “Ivan Golunov is a prominent critic and his investigations into government corruption clearly did not go down well with the authorities. It seems he is now paying the price.” "|"Prominent investigative journalist Ivan Golunov detained in Russia "|"2019-06-07T09:36:56-0400"|"Russia,Russian journalist,Ivan Golunov,news,world,drugs,Moscow police,golunov,police,journalist,russia,meduza,apartment,moscow,timchenko",

Mohamed Noor was convicted in April of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in the July, 2017, death of Justine Ruszczyk Damond, a 40-year-old dual citizen of the U.S. and Australia. Mr. Noor shot Ms. Damond when she approached his squad car in the alley behind her home. Mr. Noor’s lawyers had argued for a light sentence, saying sending him to prison would only compound the tragedy and keep him from doing service to make amends. But Judge Kathryn Quaintance sentenced Noor, 33, to a term identical to the recommendation under state guidelines. “The act may have been based on a miscalculation, but it was an intentional act,” Judge Quaintance said. “Good people sometimes do bad things.” The case, which sparked outrage in both the U.S. and Australia, has been fraught by race from the start. Mr. Noor is Somali American and Ms. Damond was white; Some in the community argued it was treated differently than police shootings in which the victims were black and the officers were white. One activist at the courthouse Friday carried a sign that had the words “Black, Muslim, Immigrant and Guilty” with boxes checked next to each word. Another read, “NOOR: Victim of Identity Politics.” Mr. Noor, his voice breaking several times as he spoke publicly about the shooting for the first time, apologized repeatedly to Ms. Damond and her family for “taking the life of a perfect person.” “I have lived with this and I will continue to live with this,” Mr. Noor said. “I caused this tragedy and it is my burden. I wish though that I could relieve that burden others feel from the loss that I caused. I cannot, and that is a troubling reality for me.” Mr. Noor said from the moment he pulled the trigger he felt fear, and he was horrified to see Ms. Damond’s body on the ground. “The depth of my error has only increased from that moment on,” he said. “Working to save her life and watching her slip away is a feeling I can’t explain … It leaves me sad, it leaves me numb, and feeling incredibly lonely. But none of that, none of those words capture what it truly feels like.” Tom Plunkett, Mr. Noor’s attorney, asked Judge Quaintance for a sentence as lenient as probation. He described Mr. Noor’s desire to become a police officer in part to repay a debt he felt to the country that took him in long ago as a refugee. “I have never stood up at sentencing with anyone my entire career that’s done more or worked harder to be a good person, to earn the gifts he’s been given,” Mr. Plunkett said. “That’s who Mohamed Noor is.” But prosecutor Amy Sweasy called for the recommended 12½ years. She noted that Ms. Damond had called 911 seeking help. “And it was the defendant’s responsibility when he encountered her in that alley to investigate and appreciate and discern that before he pulled the trigger,” she said. “That was his responsibility, and his failure to do that is what resulted in the criminal act.” Mr. Noor testified during his trial that a loud bang on the squad car startled him and his partner, and that he saw a woman at his partner’s window raising her arm. He said he fired to protect his partner’s life. But prosecutors criticized Mr. Noor for shooting without seeing a weapon or Ms. Damond’s hands, and disputed whether either of them really heard a bang. Don Damond, the victim’s fiancé, said in court Friday that every time he sees the alley where she walked barefoot and in her pyjamas toward the police car he relives the moment. “In my mind I beg you to turn around,” he said, speaking of a “lost future” of decades filled with “love, family, joy and laughter.” He said Justine Damond was his soul mate with “a Muppetlike way of being in the world.” “We both lived with our hearts open, caring for others,” Mr. Damond said. Ms. Damon’s father, John Ruszczyk, in a statement read in court, asked for the maximum sentence and called her killing “an obscene act by an agent of the state.” “Justine’s death has left me incomplete – it is as if I have lost a limb or a leg,” he said in the statement. “I have lost my daughter, I have lost those private conversations over tea.” Mr. Noor sat quietly at the defence table with hands clasped, eyes usually closed and showing no emotion as victim impact statements were read. Mr. Noor was sent after his conviction to the most secure unit at the state’s maximum security prison in Oak Park Heights for his own safety.

Anand Kumar, the mathematician behind the Super 30 school in eastern India, was interviewed in 2011. The Globe’s story caught the attention of B.C. psychiatrist Biju Mathew, who tracked down Mr. Kumar and wrote a book on him, now the basis for the film starring actor Hrithik Roshan. “When I wrote the book, I wanted this [story] told to the world,” said Dr. Mathew, who lives in Maple Ridge, B.C., but is originally from Kerala, in south India. Dr. Mathew was in the staff room of Ridge Meadows Hospital when he read a story by The Globe’s then-South Asia correspondent, Stephanie Nolen, about Mr. Kumar’s program, which is called Super 30. Every year, Mr. Kumar would recruit 30 students from Bihar’s poorest families to help train them for the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) entrance exams. The network of colleges, India’s most prestigious, mostly accepts students who have had access to expensive private schools. Most of Mr. Kumar’s students, however, are the first in their families to attend high school and, in some years, they have recorded a near-total success rate in the admission exam. As founding president of a South Asian cultural society, Dr. Mathew was looking in 2011 for a fundraising speaker from India to give a talk on education. “Kumar was the right fit,” Dr. Mathew said, adding that he had become a popular figure in India by then and Dr. Mathew wasn’t sure he would accept the invitation. But he did, and received a standing ovation after his address. After they had spent a few days together, Dr. Mathew felt Mr. Kumar’s story was worth sharing. He proposed that he write a book on his life and Mr. Kumar agreed. A few months later, Dr. Mathew travelled to Bihar to see Super 30 for himself and interview Mr. Kumar’s students and colleagues. The book, which took him more than three years to write, was a hit in India after it was published in 2016. Dr. Mathew donated all the proceeds to the Super 30 school. The trailer for Super 30, which was directed by Vikas Bahl, was released on June 4 and has already racked up more than 32 million views on YouTube. On Twitter, Mr. Kumar credited The Globe’s role in leading to his Bollywood debut: “You are perhaps not aware that you have played a big role in the making of the upcoming film,” he wrote to Ms. Nolen. Super 30 is set to be released globally on July 12.

"263"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-trump-allows-high-tech-us-bomb-parts-to-be-built-in-saudi-arabia-5/"|"Walt Bogdanich Michael LaForgia"|"When the Trump administration declared an emergency last month and fast-tracked the sale of more U.S. arms to Saudi Arabia, it did more than anger members of Congress who opposed the sale on humanitarian grounds. It also raised concerns that the Saudis could gain access to technology that would let them produce their own versions of U.S. precision-guided bombs – weapons they have used in strikes on civilians since they began fighting a war in Yemen four years ago. The emergency authorization allows Raytheon Co., a top U.S. defence firm, to team with the Saudis to build high-tech bomb parts in Saudi Arabia. That provision, which has not been previously reported, is part of a broad package of information the administration released this week to Congress. The move grants Raytheon and the Saudis sweeping permission to begin assembling the control systems, guidance electronics and circuit cards that are essential to the company’s Paveway smart bombs. The United States has closely guarded such technology for national security reasons. Multiple reports by human rights groups over the past four years have singled out the weapons as being used in air strikes on civilians. One attack, on a Sanaa funeral home in October, 2016, led the Obama administration to suspend bomb sales to the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. The new arrangement is part of a larger arms package, previously blocked by Congress, that includes 120,000 precision-guided bombs that Raytheon is prepared to ship to the coalition. These will add to the tens of thousands of bombs that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have already stockpiled, and some in Congress fear the surplus would let the countries continue fighting in Yemen long into the future. The move also includes support for Saudi F-15 warplanes, mortars, anti-tank missiles and .50-calibre rifles. The emergency declaration, invoked in part because of tensions with Iran, prompted a broad bipartisan pushback from lawmakers who were concerned not only about the war, but also about whether the Trump administration was usurping congressional authority to approve arms sales. A group of senators that includes Republicans Lindsey Graham and Rand Paul and Democrat Robert Menendez announced Wednesday that they would introduce 22 separate measures expressing disapproval of the deals. “Few nations should be trusted less than Saudi Arabia,” Mr. Paul said in a statement Thursday. “In recent years, they have fomented human atrocities, repeatedly lied to the United States and have proved to be a reckless regional pariah. It is concerning and irresponsible for the United States to continue providing them arms.” In the House of Representatives, the foreign affairs committee has scheduled a hearing for next week in which members plan to question R. Clarke Cooper, the State Department official whose bureau licenses arms exports. “The Saudis and Emiratis have become so intertwined with the Trump administration that I don’t think the President is capable of distinguishing America’s national interests from theirs,” said Democratic Representative Tom Malinowski, who sits on the committee. “The administration has presented us no evidence that Saudi Arabia and the UAE face any substantially new or intensified threat from Iran that would justify declaring an emergency.” Mr. Malinowski, a top human rights official under former president Barack Obama, said the bombs were for use in Yemen, not for defending the Saudi or Emirati homeland from Iran, as some Trump administration officials have suggested. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. A Raytheon spokesman said there was nothing unusual about the production arrangement. “Industrial participation by local partners has been an element of international sales of military equipment for decades,” said the spokesman, Mike Doble. “These activities and related technologies are governed by the Arms Export Control Act, controlled by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, and conform to all licensing rules and restrictions of the United States government.” Defence contractors have established close ties with the Trump administration, and key executives from several companies, including Raytheon, have made their way into high-ranking positions. Raytheon’s former vice president for government relations, Mark T. Esper, was confirmed as Army secretary in 2017. The defence firm has also cultivated ties to the Saudi government. During President Donald Trump’s visit to the kingdom in May, 2017, Raytheon signed an agreement to work more closely with the Saudi Arabian Military Industries Co., a holding company owned by the country’s sovereign wealth fund. It was unclear whether the new production deal fell under that plan. The production agreement took some lawmakers by surprise. Representative Ted Lieu, an outspoken critic of the Yemen war, said it seemed “to serve no purpose other than to forfeit our technology and prevent future congressional oversight.” The arrangement, which would effectively outsource jobs, appears to be at odds with Trump’s position that arms sales are important because of the American jobs they create. Rob Berschinski, a senior vice-president at Human Rights First, an advocacy group, said the administration’s decision was “about siding unreservedly with favoured Middle Eastern authoritarians, no matter who they kill or how they repress their citizens.” Mr. Berschinski, a former deputy assistant secretary of state, added, “It has nothing to do with American jobs.” Congress had been informally blocking the sale of the smart bombs at least since May, 2018, when Mr. Menendez and Representative Eliot L. Engel expressed concerns over how the Saudis were using the weapons in Yemen. Opposition intensified after U.S. intelligence officials concluded that the Saudi government played a role in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi dissident and columnist for The Washington Post. But then, last month, on the Friday before Memorial Day weekend, Mr. Trump took the rare step of declaring an emergency to push these weapons out the door. In a May 24 letter, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo notified congressional leaders of the emergency declaration, waiving congressional review of the weapon sales. Mr. Pompeo said he took into account “political, military, economic, human rights and arms control considerations.” The State Department on Monday disclosed more details to Congress, including the nature of the arms sales. “If Saudi Arabia is able to develop an indigenous bomb-making capability as a result of this deal, it will undermine U.S. leverage to prevent them from engaging in indiscriminate strikes of the kind it has carried out in Yemen,” said William D. Hartung, director of the Arms and Security Project at the Center for International Policy, a think tank. The authorization paperwork signed by Mr. Pompeo offers no timeline for the shared operations to get under way, and Raytheon representatives have said they are still negotiating over details with the Saudi government, according to a congressional aide. Aside from potentially providing the Saudis with more bombs to use in Yemen air strikes, the arrangement raised security concerns among lawmakers, who were seeking assurances that the Saudis could prevent the American technology from falling into the wrong hands. Both Republicans and Democrats also noted that it called for creating manufacturing jobs in Saudi Arabia that might otherwise have been located in the United States. And they expressed worry that the Saudis might eventually copy the technology and use it to produce their own weapons, which they would be free to use in Yemen or sell to whomever they chose. The Saudis have been carrying out regular air strikes in Yemen since March, 2015, when Houthi rebels overthrew the Saudi-backed government. The war has created what the United Nations has called the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, pushing millions to the edge of starvation and leading to the spread of cholera and the deaths of thousands of civilians.

Finance ministers and central bank governors from the world’s 20 biggest economies, the G20, are meeting this weekend in the Japanese city of Fukuoka to discuss the global economy, with trade tensions between the world’s two biggest economies seen as a key risk to global growth. “As for trade, the language will be reminiscent of previous communiques,” said one G20 official familiar with the draft of the joint statement. On the insistence of the new administration of U.S. president Donald Trump, G20 financial leaders replaced in 2017 a standard phrase about avoiding all forms of protectionism with a sentence that they would work “to strengthen the contribution of trade to our economies.” Asked if the new phrasing would be kept also this time, a second G20 official said: “Yes, most probably”. Officials said the U.S.-China trade conflict was spilling over to other areas of discussions at the G20, making the drafting of the final statement increasingly difficult. “If we go down this route, we risk clogging the G20,” the first official said. China warned its companies operating in the United States on Tuesday they could face harassment from U.S. law enforcement agencies, and Beijing also rebuffed U.S. criticism of a Chinese trade white paper as “singing the same old tune”. Relations between the world’s two largest economies have nosedived in recent months due to a tariffs battle, U.S. sanctions against Chinese telecoms giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and U.S. support for Chinese-claimed Taiwan. The G20 pledge not to use competitive devaluations to gain advantage in international trade will remain in place, although the language on foreign exchange had not been finalized yet, officials said. U.S. President Donald Trump and China’s President Xi Jinping are expected to meet on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Osaka later this month to seek a deal that would end the trade tensions, but officials have said hopes for a solution were low.

"265"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-civil-disobedience-campaign-empties-streets-of-khartoum-sudans/"|"Bassam Hatoum And Samy Magdy"|"Shops were closed and streets were empty across Sudan on Sunday, the first day of a general strike called for the start of the workweek by protest leaders demanding the resignation of the ruling military council. The Sudanese Professionals Association urged people to stay home to protest the deadly crackdown last week when security forces violently dispersed the group’s main sit-in outside the military headquarters in the capital, Khartoum. The protesters say more than 100 people have been killed since the crackdown began June 3, including at least four slain by security forces on Sunday. The protesters hope that their strike and campaign of civil disobedience will force the military to hand over power to civilians. The military leaders ousted longtime President Omar al-Bashir in April after four months of rallies. The generals have refused demonstrators’ demands for an immediate move to civilian rule, instead pushing for a transitional power-sharing arrangement. The SPA posted photos of what it said was an empty Khartoum International Airport, adding that airport workers and pilots are taking part in the civil disobedience. Other videos online showed offices and businesses closed and light traffic, in both Khartoum and the Red Sea city of Port Sudan. SPA activist Dura Gambo said participation in the general strike “exceeded our expectations.” “All private and some government banks joined the strike. Cities across the country are almost empty,” she said. The head of the leading opposition Umma party, Sadek al-Mahdi, warned of escalation from both the protest leaders and the military council. “The mutual escalation damages the county. We have been working to adjust the strike and disobedience to contain the escalation,” he said in televised comments. Military council spokesman Shams al-Deen al-Kabashi urged the protest leaders to retract their call for civil disobedience. In televised comments, al-Kabashi said the council would accept proposals provided by Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to resume talks. Ahmed has been trying to revive negotiations between the generals and the protest leaders. “We have no objections to get back to negotiations and reach consensus,” al-Kabashi said, adding that it would study the conditions provided by the Forces for Declaration of Freedom and Change, an umbrella group of opposition figures and protest leaders. An Associated Press journalist saw a heavy deployment of troops from the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces in several parts of Khartoum and its sister city of Omdurman. There are long lines for fuel in several areas in the capital. The internet remains cut off in Khartoum, and other types of communications also are restricted, with reports of mobile network services heavily disrupted. Security forces removed barricades from main roads and opened the sit-in area outside the military’s headquarters for the first time in a week. The SPA urged protesters to avoid clashes with the RSF. The RSF grew out of the notorious Janjaweed militias used by al-Bashir in the Darfur conflict in the early 2000s. Protesters accuse it of leading the nationwide crackdown, and the SPA has called for the force to be disbanded. The Sudan Doctors’ Committee, the medical affiliate of the SPA, said that of the four people killed Sunday, one was a young man who was shot by the RSF in Khartoum’s Bahri neighbourhood. Two others died of their wounds after RSF forces beat them, and a fourth was shot in Omdurman, it said. The committee says 118 people have been killed since June 3. The military-run Health Ministry has offered a lower death toll of 61, including 49 civilians and three security forces in Khartoum. The World Health Organization said Saturday that 784 people were wounded in Khartoum since June 3, although it added that the actual number could be higher because not all cases are reported or recorded. The opposition Sudanese Congress Party posted video of what it said was a funeral in Bahri. The SPA said peaceful, civil disobedience and a general strike “is the fastest and most effective way to topple the military council ... and to hand over power to a transitional civilian authority.” It urged international agencies to refrain from dealing with the military council. The SPA said security forces have arrested and intimidated activists, bankers, doctors, air traffic workers and other professionals recently. “Dozens of airport workers have been arrested by intelligence and the RSF since Monday. We do not know their whereabouts. New workers have been seen in the past days to replace those who took part in the strike,” an airport worker told the AP, speaking on condition of anonymity, fearing reprisal. The state-run SUNA news agency quoted authorities as saying the airport was working normally and that all staff had reported for duty Sunday. The Sudan Pharmacists Central Committee, which is part of the SPA, said RSF forces raided a government health agency in Khartoum that supplies medications and other care needs for patients across Sudan. The RSF has been accused of targeting hospitals and clinics treating wounded protesters. The Umma party said Saturday that security forces had arrested one of its leaders, Adel al-Mufti, along with other opposition figures, including Mohammed Esmat, a negotiator for the protesters. Esmat was detained after meeting with the Ethiopian prime minister on Friday. The Ethiopian initiative to revive the talks is focused on restoring all previous deals between the military council and the Forces for Declaration of Freedom and Change. Last week, the military said deals with the FDFC would be cancelled, according to protesters. Those deals include a three-year transition period, a Cabinet formed by the protesters and a legislative body with a majority from the FDFC. Both sides remain divided over the makeup and leader of the sovereign council that would run Sudan during the transition. The Ethiopian prime minister proposed a council with eight seats for civilians and seven for the military, with a rotating leadership. The protesters also want an independent, internationally backed body to investigate violence since al-Bashir’s April 11 ouster and to bring those responsible for the bloodshed to justice.

"266"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-boris-johnson-says-he-would-withhold-us496-billion-british-payment/"|"David Milliken"|"Boris Johnson, the leading candidate to succeed Theresa May as Britain’s prime minister, said on Sunday he would withhold an already agreed £39-billion ($65-billion) Brexit payment until the European Union gives the United Kingdom better withdrawal terms. Mr. Johnson is one of 11 lawmakers vying to run the world’s fifth largest economy after Ms. May resigned as leader of the governing Conservatives on Friday, having failed to unite Parliament or the country behind her Brexit plan. Britain is mired in its deepest political crisis in decades over how, when and whether it should leave the EU – a decision that will fall to Ms. May’s successor and affect both its future role on the world stage and prosperity for generations to come. As the contest to replace Ms. May gathered pace on Sunday, Mr. Johnson made his first major intervention, targeting the large pro-Brexit wing of his Conservative Party with a promise to take a hard line with Brussels over the terms of Britain’s exit. “I think our friends and partners need to understand that the money is going to be retained until such time as we have greater clarity about the way forward,” Mr. Johnson told the Sunday Times. “In getting a good deal, money is a great solvent and a great lubricant.” Main rivals Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt, Agriculture Minister Michael Gove and Interior Minister Sajid Javid, also want to renegotiate or modify the deal, but none have threatened to withhold the exit bill Ms. May agreed to pay the EU in 2018. The payment represents outstanding British liabilities to the EU to be paid over a number of years. The EU has repeatedly said it will not reopen discussion of the Brexit transition deal it reached with Ms. May last year, which British lawmakers have rejected three times, or to negotiate a future trade deal with Britain without the divorce payment. Those three defeats forced Ms. May to announce her resignation. “We will have a different attitude in the negotiating team and a different negotiating team,” Mr. Johnson said, adding that he would give personal orders to negotiators from his ministerial team rather than politically impartial public servants. Mr. Johnson also said border arrangements with Ireland should be settled only as part of a long-term agreement, rejecting a negotiated “backstop” that would preserve the open border with Northern Ireland, a British province, but which Conservative lawmakers fear is a backdoor way of requiring Britain to continue to follow EU rules after Brexit. Shortly after the Johnson interview was published, he won the backing of pro-Brexit lawmaker Steve Baker, an influential figure in the party’s hardline Euroskeptic wing. Mr. Johnson, popular with Conservative grassroots members who will be given a choice between the final two candidates, first has to win enough support among elected Conservative lawmakers -- where the depth of his support is less well known -- to make it onto that shortlist. Conservative members of Parliament will begin whittling the list down this week with a series of votes. Ahead of that, the leading candidates were out in force on Sunday setting out their thoughts on everything from Brexit and tax to drug-taking. Mr. Gove, seen as one of the strongest challengers to Mr. Johnson, apologized for using cocaine 20 years ago. “It was a mistake, and it was a mistake that I deeply regret,” he told the BBC. He set out plans to rip up rules on value-added tax -- one of the country’s most lucrative sales taxes -- and replace it with a simpler system. He also confirmed he would be willing to delay Brexit by a few days or weeks if a deal with the EU was close. Britain’s original departure date was March 29 but that was shelved after Ms. May’s withdrawal bill was repeatedly rejected in parliament. The current deadline is Oct. 31. Mr. Hunt did not commit to when Britain would leave the EU, but said it had to be with a deal, or else the country would face a general election in which the Conservatives could lose out to leftist Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn. Mr. Javid, another candidate seen as having the potential to beat Mr. Johnson, set out his intent to reopen negotiations in Brussels by offering to pay hundreds of millions of pounds to cover the implementation of a new border system to smooth trade between Britain and Ireland.

"267"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-moldovan-president-suspended-snap-election-called-as-political-crisis/"|"Alexander Tanas"|"A Moldovan court temporarily relieved President Igor Dodon of his duties on Sunday to allow a stand-in to call a snap election, deepening a standoff between rival political parties over the formation of a new government after months of deadlock. Dodon’s replacement, former Prime Minister Pavel Filip, immediately announced a snap election for September, while thousands of supporters of Filip’s party rallied in the capital, Chisinau. The crisis threatens more instability in one of Europe’s smallest and poorest nations, where entrenched corruption and low living standards have pushed many citizens in the country of 3.5 million people to emigrate to Russia or wealthier European countries. Dodon’s Russian-backed Socialist Party had said on Saturday it was forming a coalition government with the pro-European Union ACUM bloc, an unlikely alliance designed to keep a party run by tycoon Vladimir Plahotniuc out of power. Plahotniuc’s Democratic Party of Moldova said the new administration had tried to usurp power at Russia’s behest, criticizing Dodon’s refusal to dissolve parliament after parties missed a court-mandated deadline last Friday to form a government. More than 10,000 of Plahotniuc and Filip’s party supporters held a protest, calling Dodon a “traitor” and demanding his resignation. Dodon said the court was not politically independent and accused the Democrats of trying to cling to power. He called on the international community to step in. “Moldovan citizens with different views on domestic and foreign policy can unite for the sake of a common goal: liberation of the Republic of Moldova from the criminal, dictatorial regime,” Dodon said in a statement. “We have no choice but to appeal to the international community to mediate in the process of a peaceful transfer of power and/or to call on the people of Moldova for an unprecedented mobilization and peaceful protests.” The court appointed Filip as interim president to allow him to sign a decree for an election. Filip said Dodon had not fulfilled his duties by failing to dissolve parliament, and called it an attempt to stage a “coup”. Amid signs of trouble brewing on Saturday, the EU’s spokeswoman called for “calm and restraint”, and for Moldova to respect the rule of law and democracy. Russia urged parties to avoid destabilization. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said Washington “calls on all Moldovan parties to show restraint and to agree on a path forward through political dialogue.” “The February 24 parliamentary elections were competitive and respected fundamental rights,” she said in a statement on Sunday. “The will of the Moldovan people as expressed in those elections must be respected without interference.” ACUM leader Maia Sandu, a former education minister and World Bank adviser, had been appointed prime minister on Saturday. But a court struck down her appointment and that of a Socialist party-nominated parliament speaker. Plahotniuc’s party supporters pitched tents in front of ministries and state institutions on Saturday night. “The tents pitched yesterday are proof that the Democratic Party wants to use law enforcement bodies to throw the country into chaos to protect a single person – Plahotniuc,” Sandu said in parliament on Sunday. “They do not want to ensure the peaceful transition of power. The orders given now by Plahotniuc are illegal,” she said. POLITICALLY DIVIDED Moldova has been dogged by political instability and corruption, especially since a scandal known as the “theft of the century” emerged in 2014-2015 in which $1 billion, around an eighth of its economic output, was pilfered from three banks. The tiny ex-Soviet republic is squeezed between Ukraine and EU member Romania. Politically divided, some of its voters favour closer ties with the EU or even reunification with Romania, while others prefer closer ties to Russia. The EU forged a deal on closer trade and political ties with Moldova in 2014 and showered it with aid but has become increasingly critical of Chisinau’s track record on reforms. An election in February produced a hung parliament and set the stage for months of coalition negotiations. On Saturday, the deputy chief of the Democratic Party, Andrian Candu, told Reuters that Dodon, the former Socialist Party head, had approached the Democrats with a coalition offer on terms set by Moscow. The coalition terms included implementing a long-standing plan to turn Moldova into a federal state that would give special recognition to the separatist region of Transdniestria, which wants to merge with Russia. Opponents of such a plan say it would give Transdniestria, and by extension Russia, an outsize say in how Moldova is run. Dodon has said the idea to federalize Moldova had come from Plahotniuc, which the latter had offered Moscow in exchange for Russian criminal cases against him being dropped. A Russian statement also said the idea had come from Plahotniuc.

"268"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-former-pakistani-president-asif-ali-zardari-arrested-in-money/"|"Munir Ahmed"|"Pakistan’s anti-graft body on Monday arrested former President Asif Ali Zardari, widower of assassinated ex-Premier Benazir Bhutto, in a multimillion dollar money laundering case that has shaken the country. The development came hours after a court in Islamabad rejected a request by Zardari and his sister Faryal Talpur for an extension of their bail that would have allowed them to remain free pending trial in the case. The court’s decision paved the way for the National Accountability Bureau to arrest the two. However, the anti-graft body did not arrest Zardari’s sister; no explanation was given. Zardari, a lawmaker in the lower house of Parliament, and his sister, also a politician, have been accused of having dozens of bogus bank accounts. Earlier on Monday, the two attended the court hearing amid tight security where their bail extensions were denied. Zardari, who appeared calm when officers came to his home shortly afterward to take him, speeding away in a convoy of vehicles, “did not resist arrest,” said former Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani, a senior leader of Zardari’s party. TV footage showed Zardari hugging his tearful daughter Aseefa Bhutto Zardari before officers took him to the Islamabad office of the anti-graft body which will arraign him before a judge on Tuesday. Supporters of Zardari, whose Pakistan People’s Party has urged calm, blocked key roads and clashed with police in various parts of the country, disrupting normal traffic. Zardari has previously been jailed for eight years after being found guilty of corruption. His party at the time also said the charges against him were politically motivated. In recent weeks, the party had accused Prime Minister Imran Khan’s government of intentionally targeting political opponents. “This is political victimization,” said Shazia Marri, a lawmaker from Zardari’s party. The anti-graft body has arrested several politicians and businessmen on corruption charges since Khan took office last year after winning a narrow majority in parliamentary elections. Khan’s predecessor, Nawaz Sharif who was removed from office by the Supreme Court over corruption allegations, is currently in prison in the eastern city of Lahore after being sentenced to seven years in a corruption case. Sharif and Zardari are long-time political rivals but their parties recently joined together, vowing to launch a protest campaign against Khan’s government over increasing inflation and a spike in prices of essential food items. Zardari became president in 2008 after Pakistan’s former military dictator Pervez Musharraf was forced to resign. Zardari’s wife Benazir Bhutto served twice as a prime minister before being killed by the Taliban in 2007. The Bhutto family has been dogged by tragedy. The party’s founder, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was ousted in a military coup and hanged by dictator Gen. Ziaul Haq. Both his sons were killed by unknown assailants. Benazir Bhutto’s only surviving sibling, her sister Sanam, lives in Britain and has stayed out of politics. Zardari served as Pakistan’s president for five years, until 2013.

"269"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-hong-kong-presses-ahead-with-extradition-bill-despite-protests/"|"Nathan VanderKlippe"|"The government of Hong Kong will continue with plans to pass new extradition rules with China’s blessing, after Beijing dismissed a massive Hong Kong protest Sunday as the product of foreign interference. “While we will continue to do the communication and explanation, there is very little merit to be gained to delay the bill. It will just cause more anxiety and divisiveness in society,” Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam said on Monday. She pledged to clarify certain parts of the proposed legislative changes, which will ease the way for people in Hong Kong to be extradited to mainland China, and also promised regular reports about the implementation of the changes. The bill is scheduled for a second reading in the city’s Legislative Council on Wednesday, with critics saying they intend to stage further protests. Ms. Lam said the Sunday demonstration – with more than a million people on the streets, according to organizers, although police estimated the crowd as a quarter that size – showed that “people are still concerned,” but stood fast to her arguments that Hong Kong must have a way to extradite people to jurisdictions with which it does not have formal agreements. “This bill is not about [the] mainland alone,” Ms. Lam said. “This bill is not initiated by the Central People's Government. I have not received any instruction or mandate from Beijing to do this bill. We were doing it and we are still doing it out of our clear conscience and our commitment to Hong Kong.” But the proposed extradition rules have raised fears that Hong Kong is racing to bring its independent legal system into much greater proximity with that of China, where courts operate under the guidance of the Communist Party. Those in Hong Kong wary of mainland influence have already watched with worry as China has built a new bridge and high-speed rail links to the city, as President Xi Jinping moves quickly to more tightly integrate Hong Kong with neighbouring Chinese cities. Beijing has offered stalwart support for the bill and for Ms. Lam herself, after protesters demanded her resignation. “The Chinese government will firmly support the [Hong Kong] Special Administration Region government in amending the two ordinances,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Monday. “We are firmly opposed to the wrong attempts by any external forces to interfere with the Hong Kong SAR’s legislative process and affairs.” Mr. Geng dismissed the number of protesters, pointing instead to an effort by a pro-Beijing alliance that has gathered nearly more than 770,000 signatures in support of the extradition bill. “That’s just the number we have at the moment, and it’s still rising,” he said. China’s Xinhua news agency described the Hong Kong protest, the largest in the city in decades, as “a public procession.” The demonstrations snaked through city streets, forming a line some three kilometres long. The event was largely peaceful, though it ended with hours of violent scuffling and injuries to both police and protesters. On Monday, some in Hong Kong called for a new set of protests to begin late Tuesday night. “We will fight till the end, by all means necessary. And I hope the liberal forces around the world can stand by us, Hong Kongers, for freedom from fear,” said Baggio Leung, a Hong Kong activist and politician. “Many people, especially youngsters, got hurt by police, and plenty of them were arrested,” he said. “Only a win will make their effort not be wasted.” In China, however, the protesters were dismissed as pawns in a foreign effort to undermine Beijing. “It cannot be doubted that the United States is using Hong Kong as a bargaining chip in the Sino-U.S. game, and even using the means of destroying Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability as a way to curb China’s development,” the Global Times, a newspaper under the Communist Party, wrote in a Chinese-language commentary. Canada has also spoken out against the extradition bill, issuing a joint statement with Britain in late May to express concern “about the potential effect of these proposals on the large number of Canadian and British citizens in Hong Kong, on business confidence and on Hong Kong’s international reputation.” Western chambers of commerce have also raised concern. In Taiwan, meanwhile, President Tsai Ing-wen on Monday used the Hong Kong extradition debate to call for the Taiwanese people to reject the notion of “one country, two systems.” That formulation was designed to give Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy when it was handed over to Chinese control in 1997. Beijing has proposed a similar system for Taiwan. “Once we accept ‘one country, two systems,’ we will lose our rights to defend freedom, democracy and human rights, as well as our rights to choose our own future,” Ms. Tsai wrote on Facebook. In China, the Hong Kong extradition bill is seen as so politically sensitive that scholars who specialize in the region hung up on phone calls requesting comment. “I refuse to answer any question concerning the extradition law and protests,” one professor in Beijing said. On China’s Twitter-like Weibo, censors scrubbed any mention of the Hong Kong protest outside state-sanctioned media. Chinese leadership “remains paranoid about potential large-scale protests,” said Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Hong Kong’s biggest historical demonstrations have also pointed to “major errors and mistakes made by the Communist Party,” he said, and the extradition bill “marks a significant milestone downhill for Hong Kong as a viable separate entity from the mainland.” Still, the bill is widely expected to pass final reading by the end of the month. It “is now a foregone conclusion,” Mr. Lam said.

"270"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-at-least-95-people-killed-in-attack-in-central-mali-officials-say/"|"Baba Ahmed"|"Assailants raided a central Mali village early Monday, killing at least 95 people in the latest massacre in a growing ethnic conflict that has been enflamed by Islamic extremists, government officials said. Nineteen people were missing after the ethnic Dogon village of Sobame Da was attacked around 3 a.m., said Interior Security Ministry spokesman Amadou Sangho. Homes were burned and animals slaughtered, the government said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility, though tensions have been high since a Dogon militia was accused of carrying out a massacre in an ethnic Peuhl village in March that left at least 157 dead. It was the conflict’s deadliest attack yet. The killings highlight the Malian security forces’ inability to contain the spreading violence, which has been blamed on extremist fighters linked to the Islamic State organization and al-Qaeda and the growing danger of frightened communities arming themselves. Mali has long battled Islamic extremism in its far north, with a French-led military intervention dispersing jihadists from the region’s major towns. The extremists have infiltrated communities much further south in recent years, stoking animosity between ethnic groups in the region with a much larger population. Some Peuhl leaders had vowed to carry out reprisals for the March bloodshed. A Dogon militia known as Dan Na Ambassagou was blamed for the attack. Militia leader Youssouf Toloba has denied his fighters were involved. Mali’s president has vowed to extinguish the militia. The massacre in March in Ogossagou led some once-demobilized fighters to take up arms again. On Monday a prominent group representing the Peuhl community, Tabital Pulaaku, issued a statement blaming the “cycle of violence” on the absence of state authority and impunity for perpetrators of attacks. “The insecurity and the large-scale massacres exploited by terrorist groups are the seeds of a total and lasting destabilization of the region,” the statement said. The Peuhl are accused of working alongside jihadists from the Islamic State of Greater Sahara organization to attack Dogon villages and prevent people from cultivating their land. In turn, the Peuhl have alleged that the Dogons are collaborating with Mali’s military, though there is no conclusive sign of state support. The groups have not been evenly matched. Human Rights Watch says the Dan Na Ambassagou militia has been behind violence that resulted in much higher death tolls, in part because the group has more sophisticated weapons. The latest massacre is a reminder that the conflict has no easily defined good or bad sides, the head of the United Nations peacekeeping mission, Mahamat Saleh Annadif, said in a statement. “Everyone is responsible,” he said. The violence in central Mali is characterized by killings, disappearances and the burning of villages “on an appalling scale,” Amnesty International said Monday. The UN Security Council plans to meet this month on Mali to discuss the renewal of what has become the world’s deadliest active UN peacekeeping mission and whether it should focus on the protection of civilians, the rights group added. Rural bands of hunters have “become paramilitary groups,” arguing that they need to defend their communities if Malian security forces cannot, Jean-Herve Jezequel with the International Crisis Group wrote after the March massacre. The tensions arose several years ago over issues such as land use, he added. “The availability of weapons of war and the pretext of fighting jihadist groups have opened the floodgates to a level of ethnic-based violence that is without precedent in the region,” he said. The victims have included women and young children, and observers say hundreds of civilians were killed last year alone. In a report late last month, the UN secretary-general said Mali’s government must address the arming of ethnic self-defence groups and the proliferation of arms in central Mali or “there is a high risk of further escalation.” The unrest in central Mali has displaced some 60,000 people, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres wrote.

"271"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-tokayev-elected-kazakh-president-after-winning-snap-election-police/"|"Tamara Vaal Mariya Gordeyeva"|"Kazakhstan’s interim president Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, chosen successor of veteran ruler Nursultan Nazarbayev who retains sweeping powers, has won a snap presidential election amid protests criticizing the vote as rigged. Nazarbayev, who ruled oil producer Kazakhstan for almost three decades, hand-picked the 66-year-old career diplomat as his successor when he stepped down in March. In a power-sharing arrangement, Nazarbayev, 78, remains chairman of the influential Security Council and leads the ruling Nur Otan party. With Tokayev winning nearly 71 per cent of the vote in a race against six rivals largely unknown to Kazakh voters, opponents denounced the election as unfair, prompting public protests despite Kazakhstan’s restrictive laws on freedom of expression. Monitors from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said “a lack of regard for fundamental rights, including detentions of peaceful protestors, and widespread voting irregularities on election day, showed scant respect for democratic standards.” During Sunday’s vote, police arrested 500 people at rallies in Almaty and Nur-Sultan, the capital city that was renamed after Nazarbayev at Tokayev’s suggestion. On Monday the number of protesters was much smaller as hundreds of police gathered at the Almaty park where Sunday’s rally took place. A Reuters correspondent saw police detain a few dozen people. But protests intensified again later in the day with hundreds of people gathering outside the Almaty police headquarters to demand the release of a detained poet and musician, who was soon set free. Some of the protesters broadcast the rally live on social networks. The crowd then marched through the city chanting “Freedom” and “Old man go away” – a common anti-Nazarbayev slogan – until police in balaclavas and black uniforms blocked their path and started detaining protesters. The Kazakh state closely controls domestic politics and public discourse. The vast majority of local media outlets do not criticize Nazarbayev, and social media and online messaging platforms were restricted during Sunday’s election. Commenting on the OSCE criticism, Tokayev said it was “just one of the international organisations” monitoring the vote and “we should not focus on the assessment of this particular organization”. “I know … how they compile these reports and how politically prejudiced they can be depending on which country they work in,” Tokayev said at his first post-election briefing. Tokayev promised to work on improving Kazakhstan’s business climate and said he would meet major foreign investors – such as Western oil companies who have pumped billions of dollars into the resource-rich nation’s economy – next month. Kazakhstan’s sovereign dollar bonds rose to record highs in reaction to Tokayev’s win as investors saw it as mitigating some, but not all, political risks. “We’re in an interim holding pattern that has the potential to go on for some time with Nazarbayev in his old age holding the reins in the background and Tokayev minding the shopfront,” said Christopher Granville, managing director at consultancy TS Lombard. “There’s no evidence of deeper fissures within Kazakhstan society but there’s a desire for change and renewal, which the current holding operation does not really deliver on.” Nazarbayev’s eldest daughter Dariga became the speaker of the Senate in March, the post previously held by Tokayev, prompting speculation she was next in line to become president. Members of Nazarbayev’s family also control some key business assets in the nation bordering Russia and China, such as Kazakhstan’s largest bank, Halyk.

"272"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-irans-foreign-minister-warns-us-it-cannot-expect-to-stay-safe/"|"Amir Vahdat Jon Gambrell"|"Iran’s foreign minister warned the U.S. on Monday that it “cannot expect to stay safe” after launching what he described as an economic war against Tehran, taking a hard-line stance amid a visit by Germany’s top diplomat seeking to defuse tensions. A stern-faced Mohammad Javad Zarif offered a series of threats over the ongoing tensions gripping the Persian Gulf. The crisis takes root in President Donald Trump’s decision over a year ago to withdraw America from Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Trump also reinstated tough sanctions on Iran, targeting its oil sector. “Mr. Trump himself has announced that the U.S. has launched an economic war against Iran,” Zarif said. “The only solution for reducing tensions in this region is stopping that economic war.” Zarif also warned: “Whoever starts a war with us will not be the one who finishes it.” Zarif’s ramped up rhetoric marked a sharp departure for the U.S.-educated diplomat and signals that Iran is taking a harder line toward the West. His public threats, which came during a joint news conference with German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, were striking because Zarif was the one who helped secure the nuclear deal, alongside the relatively moderate President Hassan Rouhani. However, he does not make the decision on whether to go to war. That is left to the supreme leader. For his part, Maas insisted his country and other European nations want to find a way to salvage the deal, which saw Iran limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. But he acknowledged there were limits. “We won’t be able to do miracles, but we are trying as best as we can to do prevent its failure,” Maas said. However, Europe has yet to be able to offer Iran a way to get around the newly imposed U.S. sanctions. Meanwhile, a July 7 deadline – imposed by Iran – looms for Europe to find a way to save the unravelling deal. Otherwise, Iran has warned it will resume enriching uranium closer to weapons-grade levels. Zarif’s comments came after Maas spoke about Israel, an arch-enemy of Iran’s government. “Israel’s right to exist is part of Germany’s founding principle and is completely non-negotiable,” Maas said. “It is a result of our history and it’s irrevocable and doesn’t just change because I am currently in Tehran.” Zarif then grew visibly angry, offering a list of Mideast problems ranging from al-Qaida to the bombing of Yemeni civilians he blamed on the U.S. and its allies, namely Saudi Arabia. “If one seeks to talk about instability in this region, those are the other parties who should be held responsible,” Zarif said. Zarif’s sharp tone likely comes from Iran’s growing frustration with Europe, as well as the ever-tightening American sanctions targeting the country. Iran’s national currency, the rial, is currently trading at nearly 130,000 to $1. It had been 32,000 to the dollar at the time of the 2015 deal. That has wiped away people’s earnings, as well as driven up prices on nearly every good in the country. European nations had pledged to create a mechanism called INSTEX, which would allow Iran to continue to trade for humanitarian goods despite American sanctions. However, that program has yet to really take off, something Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman noted before Zarif and Maas spoke to reporters. “We haven’t put much hope in INSTEX,” spokesman Abbas Mousavi said, according to Iranian state television. “If INSTEX was going to help us, it would have done so already.” Maas later met Rouhani as well. “We expect Europe to stand up to the United States’ economic terrorism against the Iranian nation, living up to its commitments under the deal,” Rouhani told him, according to a statement. Trump, in withdrawing from the deal, pointed that the accord had not limited Iran’s ballistic missile program, or addressed what American officials describe as Tehran’s malign influence across the wider Mideast. Back when the deal was struck in 2015, it was described it as a building block toward further negotiations with Iran, whose Islamic government has had a tense relationship with America since the 1979 takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and subsequent hostage crisis. Some members of Trump’s administration, particularly National Security Adviser John Bolton, previously supported the overthrow of Iran’s government. Trump, however, has stressed that he wants to talk with Iran’s clerical rulers. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will arrive in Tehran on Wednesday as an interlocutor for Trump. Japan had once purchased Iranian oil, but it has now stopped over American sanctions. However, Mideast oil remains crucial to Japan and recent threats from Iran to close off the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth through which a third of all oil traded by sea passes, has raised concerns. The semi-official Tasnim news agency reported that Ali Asghar Zarean, deputy head of Iran’s nuclear department, said Tehran had increased the number of its centrifuges to 1,044 at the Fordo underground facility. That’s the maximum allowed under the deal. Meanwhile, the head of the UN atomic watchdog said Monday that Iran had already increased its uranium enrichment activities. Iran previously announced it would quadruple its production of low-enrichment uranium. “I am worried about increasing tensions over the Iranian nuclear issue,” Yukiya Amano of the International Atomic Energy Agency said. “As I have constantly emphasized, the nuclear-related commitments entered into by Iran under the (deal) represent a significant gain for nuclear verification – I therefore hope that ways can be found to reduce current tensions through dialogue.” "|"Iran’s foreign minister warns U.S. it ‘cannot expect to stay safe’"|"2019-06-10T07:46:27-0400"|"Iran,Iran's foreign minister,trade war,U.S.-Iran tensions,Gulf,Iran nuclear deal,Donald Trump,Mohammad Javad Zarif,news,world,iran,zarif,deal,trump,war", 
"273"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-british-pm-candidate-boris-johnson-pledges-tax-cut-as-race-to-succeed/"|"Paul Waldie"|"It’s an unenviable job that’s rife with backstabbing and sometimes ends in tears, but 10 candidates have come forward to become Britain’s next prime minister. The post is being vacated by Theresa May who has been pushed out as Conservative party leader and Prime Minister after less than three years in office. Ms. May’s failing, in the eyes of many Tories, has been her inability to pull the country out of the European Union by the March 29 deadline. The date has been pushed to Oct. 31 but Britain is still no closer to negotiating the terms of its departure with the EU. The race to succeed Ms. May officially began on Monday – when candidates were required to submit their papers – and the campaign is off to a rambunctious start with candidates attacking each other over past drug use and who is best able to deliver Brexit and save the Conservatives from sagging popularity. The party has been dragged down by the Brexit turmoil and finished fifth in the recent elections to the European parliament. Much of the Conservative support has gone to the new Brexit Party, formed two months ago by long-time Euroskeptic Nigel Farage. The front-runner is former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, a fierce critic of Ms. May’s Brexit strategy who believes the country can leave the EU without any agreement. Mr. Johnson, 54, upped the ante over the weekend by promising to withhold the £39-billion ($65.5-billion) “divorce bill” Britain has agreed to pay the EU to push for a better deal. “I think our friends and partners need to understand that the money is going to be retained until such time as we have greater clarity about the way forward,” Mr. Johnson told The Sunday Times. “In getting a good deal, money is a great solvent and a great lubricant.” That stance has raised eyebrows in Brussels and has led some EU officials to suggest it would amount to Britain defaulting on its sovereign debt which could make it harder for the country to raise money in global debt markets. Mr. Johnson has also drawn criticism from other leadership contenders who believe his tough line on Brexit is irresponsible and impossible to deliver. “We need the art of tough negotiation, not the art of empty rhetoric,” said leadership rival Jeremy Hunt, the Foreign Secretary. Mr. Hunt, 52, favours seeking a deal and he’s open to extending the deadline if an agreement was in sight. "We won’t deliver Brexit with bluff and bluster,” added another leadership candidate Dominic Raab, 45, a former Brexit secretary who has also taken a tough line on Brexit but insisted on Monday that he doesn’t want to leave without an agreement. Mr. Johnson’s main rival in the race was supposed to be Environment Secretary Michael Gove, 51. The two men led the Vote Leave campaign in the 2016 Brexit referendum but their relationship has deteriorated. Mr. Gove’s campaign got off to a rough start on Monday after he admitted using cocaine several times when he worked as a journalist more than 20 years ago. He has referred to the drug use as a mistake and admitted he was fortunate to have avoided being arrested. But the issue hasn’t gone away especially since an article he wrote in 1999 surfaced in which he condemned “London’s liberal consensus” for pushing for looser laws on drug use. Critics have also pointed out that when he was education secretary, Mr. Gove ordered teachers who took drugs to resign. Sayeeda Warsi, a former Tory co-chairman, said Mr. Gove had shown “hypocrisy of the highest order” and should quit the race. Mr. Gove tried to steer away from the controversy at his campaign launch Monday, preferring to focus on his plan to cut taxes and negotiate a Brexit deal. He also took a shot at Mr. Johnson. Referring to the 2016 leadership race when Mr. Johnson abruptly stepped aside, Mr. Gove said: “Mr. Johnson, whatever you do, don’t pull out. I know you have before, and I know you may not believe in your heart that you can do it, but the Conservative Party membership deserve a choice.” Mr. Johnson is expected to launch his campaign on Tuesday and so far he has kept a lower profile than the other candidates. He has a history of missteps and his advisers appear keen to manage his campaign carefully. Of the 10 final candidates, two are female: former house leader, Andrea Leadsom, and former work and pensions secretary Esther McVey. Rounding out the group are current and former cabinet members Sajid Javid, Matt Hancock, Rory Stewart and Mark Harper. Being the front-runner is no guarantee of success and the leadership rules allow for unpredictable finishes. Only MPs can run and all 313 Tory MPs will begin voting this week to winnow the field down to two candidates. The party’s roughly 120,000 members will then select the winner in a postal vote next month. The new leader will be announced during the week of July 22 and he or she will take over as prime minister from Ms. May.

The Interior Ministry said in a statement that the prisoners had been arrested for crimes against safety and public order and that authorities “continue preparing for the release” of others. Representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross observed the releases, it added. One of those freed, Hansell Vasquez, said he felt “happy to have escaped that hell” but also “sad and worried because the country is more locked up than when we became prisoners.” The Civic Alliance opposition group recently said 186 government opponents remained behind bars. Lawyer Yonarqui Martinez, who defends some of the imprisoned government opponents, called for all to be released and for the cases against them to be dismissed. The releases came two days after lawmakers passed an amnesty bill for crimes related to the largely student-led protests that erupted in April 2018 over a social security overhaul and broadened to include a demand for President Daniel Ortega’s exit from office and early elections. Opposition leaders say the measure would forgive killings and other abuses by police and pro-government civilian militias during a crackdown on demonstrators in which at least 325 civilians were killed and more than 2,000 wounded. The government says the amnesty seeks the “reconciliation of society.” Tamara Zamora, the mother of Nicaraguan-Belgian student Amaya Coppens, said her daughter is now alone in her cell after another student was freed Monday. “Amaya has been in prison nine months as of today,” Zamora said. “This is torture. They are killing us slowly.” Journalists and students were among those released. Still in jail are farm leaders, a university official, former military members and several student protest leaders. A delegation from the Inter American Press Association arrived in the country Sunday to press for the release of Miguel Mora and Lucia Pineda, two news leaders at 100% Noticias who were arrested when the channel was shut down in December. They were not among those freed Monday. For years Nicaragua has been receiving oil from ally Venezuela on preferential terms, a lifeline for the economy. Nicaragua’s Central Bank revealed Friday that that aid fell 73.4%, from $102 million in 2017 to just $27.2 million last year. Opposition leaders allege that nearly $5 billion in funds from Venezuelan co-operation has been handled outside of the government budget by a mixed state and private company, Alba de Nicaragua S.A.

Syria’s Russian-backed military has been pressing an assault on rebels in their last major stronghold with air attacks and ground battles that have already forced tens of thousands to leave their homes. “Our fear is if this continues, and if the numbers continue soaring, and if the conflict intensifies, that we could see really hundreds of thousands, a million, two, heading towards the borders with Turkey,” the UN regional humanitarian co-ordinator for the Syria Crisis, Panos Moumtzis, said. The onslaught since late April, focused mostly on southern parts of Idlib province and adjacent parts of Hama and Latakia, marks the most intense conflict between President Bashar al-Assad and his insurgent enemies since last summer. Mr. Moumtzis said in Geneva that the situation was deteriorating and a deal between Russia and Turkey to de-escalate the fighting there was effectively no longer in place. “We see an offensive that is really targeting – or with an impact on – hospitals and schools in civilian areas, in areas where there is the population and urban areas – which really should not be happening according to international humanitarian law,” Mr. Moumtzis said. Aid organizations have been encouraged to share their locations with the warring parties to avoid being hit. But after repeated air strikes on hospitals, many aid workers distrust such requests, Mr. Moumtzis said. “It’s a catastrophe, what has been happening ... for the sake of humanity, there has to be an intervention,” he said. “A few months ago, we asked to make sure that this nightmare scenario will not take place. Actually, it’s unfolding in front of our own eyes as we speak.” The UN appealed for US$3.3-billion to cover humanitarian work within Syria this year and, despite generous pledges, it has so far received only US$500-million, leaving the aid effort surviving “hand-to-mouth,” Mr. Moumtzis said.

"276"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-lgbt-catholics-denounce-vatican-document-on-gender/"|"Nicole Winfield"|"The Vatican issued an official document Monday rejecting the idea that people can choose or change their genders and insisting on the sexual “complementarity” of men and women to make babies. The document, published during LGBT Pride Month, was immediately denounced by LGBT Catholics as contributing to bigotry and violence against gay and transgender people. Advocacy group New Ways Ministry said it would further confuse individuals questioning their gender identity or sexual orientation and at risk of self-harm. The text, “Male and Female He Created Them,” was intended to help Catholic teachers, parents, students and clergy address what the Vatican’s Congregation for Catholic Education called an “educational crisis” in the field of sex education. It called for a “path of dialogue” and listening on the issue of “gender theory” in education. But even priestly advocates for LGBT Catholics said that the text appeared to have relied entirely on previous papal pronouncements, Vatican documents and philosophers and theologians. “The real-life experiences of LGBT people seem entirely absent from this document,” said the Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit priest who wrote a book on improving Catholic Church outreach to the LGBT community, titled “Building a Bridge.” ”We should welcome the congregation’s call to dialogue and listening on gender, and I hope that conversation will now begin.“ Pope Francis has repeatedly argued the position that people cannot choose their genders. But the document represents the first attempt to put the Vatican’s position, first articulated fully by Pope Benedict XVI in a 2012 speech, into a comprehensive, official text. The document called for a new alliance among families, schools and society to offer a “positive and prudent sexual education” in Catholic schools so children learn the “full original truth of masculinity and femininity.” It called gender fluidity a symptom of the “confused concept of freedom” and “momentary desires” that characterize postmodern culture. It rejected terms such as “intersex” and “transgender” and said the purpose of the biological “complementarity” of the male and female sex organs was to ensure procreation. Francis DeBernardo, head of New Ways Ministry, said such concepts are outdated, misinformed and ignore contemporary science on factors beyond visible genitalia that determine gender. “Gender is also biologically determined by genetics, hormones and brain chemistry – things not visible at birth,” Mr. DeBernardo said in a statement. “People do not choose their gender, as the Vatican claims, they discover it through their lived experiences.” He said the Catholic Church should encourage this process of discovery, saying it’s “a process by which individuals discover the wonderful way that God has created them.” "|"LGBT Catholics denounce Vatican document on gender"|"2019-06-10T12:08:33-0400"|"Vatican,Vatican gender document,LGBTQ,gender identity,gender change,Male and Female He Created Them,Catholic Education,news,world,gender,people,document,vatican,lgbt,position",

The plan, which appears to build on a proposal by Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed presented during a mediation visit to Khartoum last week, could help break a deadlock between the country’s military rulers and the civilian opposition in efforts to agree on a transition to democracy. Mr. Abiy visited Khartoum on a mediation mission in which he proposed a 15-member transitional council consisting of eight civilians and seven army officers to lead the country to democracy. Tensions have soared in Sudan since security forces violently broke up a protest camp in central Khartoum a week ago, killing dozens of protesters. The opposition have responded by declaring civil disobedience that has curtailed life in the capital. An opposition leader said that the Declaration of Freedom and Change Forces (DFCF) alliance planned to announce nominating Abdullah Hamdouk, a former executive secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, as new prime minister. “This is in addition to announcing eight members of the sovereign council, including three women,” the source, who asked not to be named, told Reuters. The source gave no further details. Opposition sources have said that an aide of Mr. Abiy had been shuttling between the two sides trying to broker a deal after his one-day visit to Khartoum. Mr. Abiy said on Monday on Twitter he had spoken to the head of the military council, Lieutenant-general Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, about “mediation progress.” The military council, in what could be a gesture to the protesters, announced on Monday that several government troops have been arrested pending legal action, after a preliminary investigation into the dispersal of the protesters last week found evidence of wrongdoing. In Washington, the State Department said that top U.S. diplomat for Africa Tibor Nagy was due to travel to Sudan this week to push for the resumption of talks on a democratic transition. Stability in Sudan is crucial for a volatile region struggling with conflict and insurgencies from the Horn of Africa to Egypt and Libya. Various powers, including Russia and the Gulf Arab states, are trying to influence its path. Earlier on Monday, the People’s Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N), one of the country’s main rebel groups, said the military rulers had released three of its leaders after several days in detention and expelled them to South Sudan. Yasir Arman, the most prominent of the three men and the deputy head of the SPLM-N, was detained last Wednesday after returning from exile following the ouster of President Omar al-Bashir in April. The two others, SPLM-N secretary-general Ismail Jallab and spokesman Mubarak Ardol, were arrested after meeting the visiting Ethiopian Prime Minister as he tried to mediate between the military council and civilian opposition. A statement from SPLM-N chairman Malik Agar said the three officials had been “denied access to their accommodation” and deported in a military aircraft to Juba, South Sudan’s capital. “This happened despite their rejection of the forceful deportation,” the statement said, adding that the move showed the military council’s intention “not to hand power to the civilians and not to reach peace.” The council could not be reached for comment. Also on Monday, Deputy U.N. spokeswoman Eri Kaneko told reporters in New York that the military council had decreed to the African Union-U.N. peacekeeping mission in Darfur to hand over its premises to Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces (RSF) as part of the mission’s withdrawal in 2020. “That is not in keeping with our existing agreement with the Sudanese government and our insistence that the facilities be used solely for civilian purposes,” she said. Witnesses said the RSF, which grew out of Arab militias that fought in Darfur, led the assault on the protest sit-in in Khartoum last week. Opposition doctors say at least 118 people have been killed since the raid on the sit-in a week ago. The government has confirmed 61 deaths, including three members of the security services. The DFCF alliance has tried to sustain the protest movement through a civil disobedience campaign that largely shut down Khartoum on Sunday. On Monday, there was a little more movement on the streets and some shops had begun to reopen, including in Khartoum’s central market, but many stores and businesses remained closed. “We are against the killing of civilians and we support the (protest movement) but today I returned to work because I earn my income day by day and I am the only source of income for my family and my children,” said Saleh Yaqoub, a 53-year-old shopkeeper.

"278"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-saudi-teen-faces-possible-execution-for-taking-part-in-protests-as-a/"|""|"A young Saudi man, arrested when he was 13, could face execution for taking part in Shiite-led protests as a child, Amnesty International said. Murtaja Qureiris, now 18, is on trial for charges that include joining a “terror group” and “sowing sedition,” according to the rights group and CNN, which first reported details of his case in recent days. He was detained in September, 2014, and held in solitary confinement for part of that time. As is typical with cases involving national security, Saudi Arabia has not commented nor made public details of the case. Concern, however, has increased after the kingdom as recently as April carried out a mass execution of 37 men, most of whom were Shiite. Among those executed was a young Shiite male arrested at age 16, according to Amnesty International. The rights group deemed the trial of some of those executed as “grossly unfair.” Mr. Qureiris is being charged with offences that involve taking part in protests when he was as young as 10. Another charge relates to his participation at the age of 11 at an anti-government rally that erupted at his older brother’s funeral who was killed while protesting in 2011 during the height of Arab Spring revolts that were roiling other parts of the Middle East. Minority Shiite protesters in Saudi Arabia’s Eastern Province launched protests that year to demand equal rights and a greater share of the kingdom’s oil wealth, which is concentrated in the east. They complained of poor government services, as well as discrimination from the country’s government-backed ultraconservative Wahhabi clerics and their Sunni followers. In recent years, as tensions with Shiite-led Iran intensified, the government under King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman also intensified a crackdown on government critics, particularly Saudi Shiites. Since 2014, more than 100 Saudi Shiites have been tried before Saudi Arabia’s anti-terrorism court on vague and wide-ranging charges arising from their opposition to the government, according to Amnesty International. In 2016, the kingdom’s highest profile Shiite cleric, Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, was executed, sparking protests from Pakistan to Iran and the ransacking of the Saudi Embassy in Tehran. Saudi-Iran ties have not recovered and the embassy remains shuttered. Details of Mr. Qureiris’s case emerged after CNN reported that Saudi prosecutors sought capital punishment against him back in 2018. Prosecutors argued that his “sowing of sedition” warranted the worst possible punishment, despite that he’s not been charged with loss of life. He has, however, been charged with shooting at security forces and accompanying his brother on a motorcycle ride to a police station in the mostly Shiite town of al-Awamiya, where the brother allegedly threw a makeshift firebomb at the station. CNN said Mr. Qureiris, whose father and brother are detained, has denied the charges with activists saying his confessions were obtained under duress.

"279"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-indian-court-sentences-three-men-to-life-in-prison-for-raping-killing/"|"Aijaz Hussain"|"A court on Monday sentenced three Hindu men, including a police officer, to life imprisonment for kidnapping, raping and murdering an eight-year-old Muslim girl in Indian-controlled Kashmir, in a case that has exacerbated tensions in the disputed region. Justice Tejwinder Singh sentenced three other policemen to five years in prison for destroying evidence, prosecutor Santokh Singh told reporters. The judge acquitted another defendant because of insufficient evidence. An eighth suspect, a minor, will be tried separately by a juvenile court, Santokh Singh said. The girl, who was a member of a nomadic tribe, was grazing her family’s ponies in the forests of the Himalayan foothills when she was kidnapped in January, 2018. Her mutilated body was found in the woods a week later. The case sparked protests across Kashmir, a Muslim-majority region where rebels have been fighting for years for independence or unification with Pakistan and there is great distrust of the government. Mr. Singh said prosecutors plan to appeal to a higher court and seek the death penalty for the three defendants who received life sentences. Thousands of members of a radical Hindu group had demanded the release of the defendants, insisting they were innocent. The trial was shifted to Pathankot, a town in neighbouring Punjab state, following accusations that local Hindu leaders and politicians were trying to block the investigation. The prosecution said the girl was raped in a small village temple in Kathua district after having been kept sedated for four days, and was then bludgeoned to death. The girl’s father, Mohammed Akhtar, told the Associated Press by phone that the men should be “punished speedily, not just convicted.” “Our family has gone through hell,” he said. “Our hearts are bleeding. These beasts should be hanged.” India has been shaken by a series of sexual assaults in recent years, including the gang rape and murder of a student on a New Delhi bus in 2012. That attack galvanized a country where widespread violence against women had long been quietly accepted. While the government has passed a series of laws increasing punishment for rape, it’s rare for more than a few weeks to pass without another brutal sexual assault being reported.

"280"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-fire-department-responding-to-reported-helicopter-crash-on-roof-of-new/"|"Gabriella Borter"|"A helicopter crashed onto the fog-shrouded roof of a midtown Manhattan skyscraper on Monday, killing the pilot and unnerving a city still scarred by memories of the Sept. 11, 2001, airplane attacks on the World Trade Center. The crash on a rainy, grey day atop the 54-storey AXA Equitable Center forced office workers to evacuate in one of the city’s busiest areas a few blocks north of Times Square. The pilot was the only person aboard the chopper when it plunged into the building and burst into flames, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio told a news conference. No injuries, either to people in the building or on the ground, have been reported. “The helicopter is pretty obliterated at this point. It was obviously a very hard hit,” Mr. de Blasio said, adding nothing indicated “an act of terrorism.” Nicolas Estevez was standing across the street from the building when a 12-inch piece of metal that appeared to be from the helicopter landed on the pavement just feet away. The crash, which sent people streaming out of the building within seconds, reminded him of Sept. 11, Mr. Estevez said. “I saw the explosion and the smoke coming out,” he said. A key mystery in the crash is why the Agusta A109E was flying at all in a rainstorm in tightly controlled airspace above midtown Manhattan. To enter that vicinity, Mr. de Blasio said, the pilot would have needed approval from the air traffic control tower at LaGuardia Airport across the East River in Queens, “and we need to find out if that happened.” The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement “FAA air traffic controllers did not handle” the helicopter’s flight, but a spokeswoman for the agency declined to say whether the aircraft was observing prevailing flight restrictions. The pilot was identified as Tim McCormack, who was going to land at Linden Airport in New Jersey, said Paul Dudley, the airport’s director. “Tim McCormack is a well-respected, highly trained veteran pilot who also had tremendous local knowledge, having flown in this area for many years,” Mr. Dudley said in a phone interview. “We’re all saddened and shocked.” Mr. McCormack worked for Daniele Bodini, founder of the real estate firm American Continental Properties Group, Mr. Dudley said. The chopper took off from a heliport on Manhattan’s east side at 1:32 p.m. and crash-landed on the building 11 minutes later, officials said. The site is about half a mile from Trump Tower, where U.S. President Donald Trump maintains an apartment. The area has been under a temporary flight restriction since his election in November 2016. Nathan Hutton, who works in information technology for the French bank BNP Paribas on the 29th floor, said the building shook when the helicopter slammed into the roof. “It felt like you were just standing there, and someone takes their hand and just shoves you,” he said. “You felt it through the whole building.” Mr. Trump called New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who was at the scene soon after the crash, to offer assistance if needed, the governor’s office said. Mr. Cuomo said the crash likely stirred memories of Sept. 11 for many city residents. “If you’re a New Yorker, you have a level of PTSD from 9/11,” he said. In addition to BNP Paribas, the AXA Equitable Center, built in 1985 houses offices for corporate tenants such as law firms Willkie Farr & Gallagher and Sidley Austin, and investment manager New Mountain Capital. Le Bernardin, one of New York City’s most celebrated restaurants, is also in the building. The skyscraper is managed by Los Angeles-based CommonWealth Partners. CommonWealth office manager LeAnn Holsapple said the company had “no comment at this time.” Manhattan has only three approved heliports after they were banned in New York City in 1977 after a rotor blade snapped on a helicopter on top of the former Pan Am building, killing five people.

"281"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-three-russian-newspapers-publish-identical-front-page-headlines-to/"|"Andrew Osborn"|"Three of Russia’s leading newspapers took the unusual step on Monday of publishing identical front-page headlines to protest over what they suspect is the framing of an investigative journalist on drug charges. Ivan Golunov, a 36-year-old journalist known for exposing corruption among Moscow city officials, was detained by police on Thursday and accused of serious drug offences which he denies. Russian journalists critical of authorities have led a dangerous existence since the 1990s – sometimes threatened, physically attacked and even murdered for their work. But the crude way supporters say Mr. Golunov was set up has triggered an unusual show of media unity and an uncharacteristically swift response from authorities nervous about social unrest at a time when President Vladimir Putin already faces disquiet over living standards. Police say they found drugs in Mr. Golunov’s rucksack, and he faces between 10 and 20 years in jail if found guilty. Fellow journalists and members of Russia’s cultural elite suspect a set-up by corrupt officials wanting to silence him. Mr. Golunov’s lawyer says he was assaulted and punched by police officers, something they deny. The three leading daily newspapers – Vedomosti, Kommersant and RBK – all carried the same headline on Monday in a rare show of solidarity: “I am/We are Ivan Golunov.” In a joint statement, they said evidence against Mr. Golunov was shaky, cast doubt over the legality of his detention, and demanded a review of police behaviour. “We expect law enforcement agencies to scrupulously observe the law and demand maximum openness when it comes to the investigation,” the statement said. “We demand the law be respected by everyone and for everyone.” Journalists protested outside Moscow’s police headquarters on Friday and during the weekend to demand the case be dropped. Celebrities and even some high-profile journalists at state media have spoken out for Mr. Golunov, criticizing either the accusations against him or the harsh manner of his detention. In what some supporters saw as a small victory, a court on Saturday rejected a request to hold Mr. Golunov in a pretrial detention facility and ordered instead that he be held under house arrest for two months while he is investigated. It is unusual, given the gravity of the accusations, for a court to agree to house arrest and the decision was seen by supporters as a sign that authorities were nervous about the outcry. State television on Sunday broadcast a program in which police operatives defended their evidence, but the same program also said that the police’s actions needed to be checked. The Kremlin said on Monday that the way Mr. Golunov’s case had been handled raised many questions. “We are closely following how this case unfolds and all its nuances,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. In Canada, Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland told reporters, “We are following the current situation in Russia very closely and with great interest and attention.” She and British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt are hosting an international conference on media freedom in London in mid-July. Ms. Freeland said the event will bring up “specific cases” around the world where the lives of journalists are at risk, but wouldn’t go into details. “We will be talking at that conference about media freedom – or lack of it – in Russia, among other countries,” she said after a talk at the International Economic Forum of the Americas in Montreal. “This will be the first of what becomes an annual event,” Ms. Freeland continued, adding Canada has committed to hosting the second conference next year.

"282"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-how-export-development-canada-overlooked-red-flags-about-south-africa/"|"Geoffrey York Matthew McClearn"|"In depth • The EDC: A Globe investigation • Explainer: What does the EDC do?  It was one of the pivotal moments of South Africa’s biggest post-apartheid corruption scandal. In late 2015, South African mining minister Mosebenzi Zwane flew to Switzerland with key members of the Gupta business family to persuade the mining giant Glencore to sell a potentially lucrative coal mine to the Guptas. After the meeting, according to leaked e-mails, the cabinet minister flew from Zurich to India on the family’s private luxury jet, which the Guptas had acquired from Bombardier Inc. for US$52-million just a few months earlier – with 80 per cent of the cost financed by Export Development Canada, the federal government’s export credit agency. The mine would later become central to a scheme that allegedly allowed the Guptas to profit from inflated prices in coal contracts with South Africa’s power utility. The jet itself would become equally notorious. In the South African media, its movements were avidly tracked. It became a vivid symbol of the Guptas, their political power and the vast wealth that they amassed from their links to South Africa’s state-owned companies. How did a Canadian Crown corporation become the financier for such a high-profile emblem of South African corruption? And why did it double down on the Guptas and approve another US$450-million loan for a locomotive contract with South Africa’s state-owned freight rail company, which was effectively controlled by Gupta proxies who – according to several subsequent inquiries – extracted hefty “consulting fees” from many of its contracts? An investigation by The Globe and Mail has found that the Gupta saga was the nadir of the EDC’s due-diligence failures: a decision to provide financing to a family that had long been exposed in the South African media for its dubious dealings and its shadowy business partnership with the son of Jacob Zuma, the president of South Africa at the time. Only in late 2017 – nearly three years after approving the Gupta jet loan – did the EDC finally decide to back out of the deal. By then, all four of South Africa’s biggest banks had already severed their relationships with the Guptas, in part because of the risks associated with handling tainted funds. This fiasco wasn’t supposed to happen. Like other financial institutions, the EDC screens its transactions to weed out prospective clients engaged in alleged corruption or other criminal activity. The goal is to protect the agency, and the federal government, from projects that could bring it into disrepute. In South Africa, however, the EDC had somehow overlooked clanging alarm bells. Years before the EDC finalized the aircraft loan to the family in early 2015, the close relationship between the Guptas and the Zuma family was an open secret in the country. There had already been scandals before 2014, documented in colourful detail in media reports and internal government inquiries, revealing how the Guptas were linked to questionable government contracts, deals that benefited the Zuma family and even a bizarre incident in 2013 in which Gupta wedding guests were flown to a military base and allowed to bypass normal immigration procedures. That year, the Guptas also reportedly offered a bribe of 500,000 rand (about US$57,000 at the time) to the chairman of South African Airways. According to testimony at an inquiry into state corruption this year, senior members of the ruling African National Congress had complained as early as 2011 that the Guptas had advance knowledge of Mr. Zuma’s cabinet appointments and were summoning ministers to their luxurious villa to inform them. Under a federal directive in 2008, the EDC was required to “give due consideration to the personal integrity of those they lend to or provide benefits to.” After all the reports and scandals about the Guptas, it is unclear how the EDC decided that they had sufficient integrity to warrant a loan. Thanks to leaked e-mails and other documents, the EDC’s loan to the Guptas affords a rare window into its approach to vetting clients. In retrospect, the EDC’s failure to recognize the family as dangerous business partners is a sign that its process failed spectacularly. Although the EDC insists it continually monitors transactions, its slowness in disentangling itself from the Guptas calls this assertion into question. And in the aftermath of it all, there are few indications that the EDC has learned the lessons or changed its practices as a result.      There are three Gupta brothers: Ajay, Atul and Rajesh. In the 1990s, after the end of apartheid, they were ambitious young immigrants from India, looking to cultivate wealth and political influence. Their ascent in South Africa was rapid. By 2016, under the freewheeling Zuma presidency, they were ranked among the richest families in the country, with an empire ranging from mining companies to computers, most of it dependent on government connections. Two years later, it all collapsed: Their political patron resigned from the presidency under pressure from his own party, criminal cases were under way and the Guptas fled South Africa to a secret location, believed to be in Dubai. They have denied all of the allegations against them. The EDC’s involvement with the Guptas began in early 2014, at a time when its biggest client, Bombardier, was zeroing in on two important South African deals. Bombardier needed an EDC loan to support an aircraft sale to the family, and it needed a much larger loan for a separate deal to sell locomotives to Transnet, the state-owned freight company. Transnet was about to make a massive purchase worth up to US$5-billion. Bombardier was one of the front-runners for the contract. Transnet was so wealthy and powerful that its name was emblazoned on the tallest office building in Africa, the Carlton Centre in Johannesburg, its corporate headquarters. By 2014, the Guptas had allies installed in all of the key positions at Transnet, including the board of directors and management team. Five years later, after the Gupta proxies had finally been sacked, Transnet chairman Popo Molefe said the company had been a “horror movie” of corruption. During the Gupta years, it had been transformed into a “piggy bank” for looters, he said. Investigations in 2018 showed that the Guptas had received hundreds of millions of dollars in “consulting fees” from a Chinese company that had shared the locomotive contract with Bombardier and others. As their wealth and power mounted, the Guptas wanted a luxury airplane. By February, 2014, a month before the locomotive deal was finalized, Bombardier was searching for funding to help the Guptas buy their jet. For the EDC, Bombardier is the agency’s largest customer by far. Since 2001, the EDC has provided between $20-billion and $46-billion in loans for Bombardier deals (the agency only reports ranges of transaction values). Even the EDC insiders sometimes call it “the bank of Bombardier.” But to get their jet, the Guptas would need to pass through the EDC’s due diligence process, which should have quickly spotted their many years of exploiting their Zuma connections. Leaked Gupta e-mails obtained by The Globe and Mail and other media outlets, and later placed into evidence at South Africa’s commission of inquiry into state corruption, show that the aircraft deal was surrounded by red flags. One of the first warning signs was on Feb. 10, 2014, when, in an e-mail from Bombardier to a senior Gupta employee, Bombardier quoted a U.S. aircraft financier who referred to the “politically connected nature of the Guptas.” The financier also asked skeptical questions about the Guptas and their murky finances. It is unclear whether Bombardier shared those concerns with the EDC. The Guptas were shopping for one of Bombardier’s most expensive private jets: a Global 6000, capable of carrying 17 passengers and crew on intercontinental flights. Bombardier executives flew to Johannesburg to meet the Guptas to discuss the deal. In e-mails to Ajay Gupta on Feb. 18, 2014, a vice-president of Bombardier’s business aircraft division promised to provide “the best priced Global on the market.” He offered the airplane for a discounted price of US$52-million, along with various “credit memos” (further discounts of US$1.35-million) and free pilot training. Most significantly, he said Bombardier had found a willing financier to help the Guptas: the EDC, which could cover 80 per cent of the cost. The Bombardier vice-president also told Mr. Gupta: “We hope that a successful conclusion will lead to further opportunities for our organizations to explore working together, whether on infrastructure or aviation-related business” The e-mails were written just a few weeks before the announcement that Bombardier won a US$1.2-billion slice of the massive contract to sell locomotives to Transnet. Bombardier has denied that there was any connection between the two deals. Over the next several months, the EDC negotiated with the Guptas to finalize the jet loan. But it quickly discovered that the Gupta finances were opaque. In May, 2014, in questions relayed by Bombardier to a senior Gupta official, the EDC noted that the 2014 financial information provided by the main Gupta company, Westdawn Investments, was difficult to interpret and “seems unaligned with 2013 performance.” Westdawn also apparently did not have “sufficient cash-flow to repay such debt obligations.” In response, Gupta lieutenant Ronica Ragavan insisted that the Guptas could juggle money among their various businesses to repay the loan. By June, the e-mails show, the Guptas still hadn’t answered the EDC’s financial questions, but a Bombardier official reassured them that the EDC was ready to “finalize the offer” as soon as the answers were given. A few weeks later, the EDC asked for a “wiring diagram” of the Guptas’ murky business empire. The agency also decided to send two specialists to South Africa for final due-diligence checks – a cost that the Guptas would be required to pay. Even on this point, the Guptas felt confident enough to haggle, with Ms. Ragavan offering just US$5,000 – barely a third of the actual cost. Throughout this period, the EDC should also have been searching for public information about the Gupta brothers – and there were literally hundreds of media reports about dodgy deals. The EDC should also have noticed that corruption was widespread in South Africa, but the country had an independent media and civil-society sector that often exposed scandals. Despite the mounds of evidence about the Guptas, the EDC signed a deal in December to provide US$41-million to cover 80 per cent of the jet’s cost. In February, 2015, Bombardier e-mailed photos of “your stunning new Global 6000” to the Guptas, and the luxury jet was delivered shortly afterward. For the next 2½ years, as investigations produced a flood of new evidence about the Guptas, the EDC stood loyally with them. In fact, according to an e-mail from a Bombardier official in June, 2015, Bombardier and the EDC were already discussing a loan to help the Guptas purchase another jet “to meet their growing travel needs.” (In the end, the deal never came to pass.) Meanwhile, less than three months after approving the first Gupta loan, the EDC went ahead with the US$450-million loan to Transnet to allow it to buy locomotives from Bombardier. According to a database of EDC transactions, it was the biggest loan that the EDC had ever provided to any South African company. “This is a massive thumbs-up for our country,” said the announcement by Transnet CEO Brian Molefe. Mr. Molefe was just one of many Gupta allies within Transnet at the time. A year later, an investigation by South Africa’s Public Protector – an anti-corruption watchdog with constitutional powers – reported evidence of a long-standing “cozy relationship” between Mr. Molefe and the Guptas, including dozens of phone calls and text messages. The influence of the Guptas over the Zuma government became even more obvious over the next two years, and the Guptas continued to fly their EDC-financed airplane around the world. In October, 2015, the federal agency opened a formal office in Johannesburg, its first in Africa, giving it a front-row seat to witness the Guptas in action. In December, 2015, lobbying by the Guptas was widely reported to be a key reason for Mr. Zuma’s dismissal of his finance minister, Nhlanhla Nene, who was resisting a nuclear energy deal that the Guptas wanted. Around the same time, one of South Africa’s biggest banks, Absa, began quietly closing the bank accounts of Gupta businesses. In testimony to the state corruption inquiry later, an Absa executive said the bank had been concerned about “evidence of large, unexplained transfers of funds” as early as November, 2014. By early 2016, the other major South African banks had also closed their Gupta accounts, worried about regulatory and reputational risks if they received funds from money-laundering or other crimes. But the EDC maintained its Gupta loan, despite the risk (later acknowledged by the EDC) that the Guptas might be using the proceeds of crime to repay it. And then, that March, deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas disclosed that the Guptas had met him in late 2015 and “offered” him the post of finance minister. Two weeks later, auditing firm KPMG announced it was ending its relationship with Gupta companies, saying that the “association risk” was “too great.” Later in the year, the Public Protector issued a 355-page report documenting allegedly corrupt connections between the Guptas and the Zuma government. Among her revelations was a devastating allegation by Mr. Jonas, who said the Guptas had offered him the equivalent of US$42,000 in cash, and US$42-million in the future, if he accepted the finance minister’s job and sacked bureaucrats who were resisting the family’s schemes. By then, the EDC was worried – but it still continued the loan. “Since the fall of 2016 we sought external counsel advice to confirm that we were not, and would not be, acting contrary to applicable proceeds of crime laws," the agency told The Globe. South Africa’s banks faced stricter regulations than the EDC. They had to abide by legislation on suspicious transactions, money laundering and the proceeds of crime and corruption. Canada’s equivalent law applies to banks and other financial institutions – but the EDC is exempt. Until mid-2017, there had been no media coverage of the EDC loan to the Guptas, which hadn’t been publicly announced. But in July, 2017, when The Globe first contacted the EDC to inquire about its Gupta loan, the agency immediately briefed its board of directors on the Gupta issue and the corruption allegations. According to EDC spokesperson Jessica Draker, this report on July 26, 2017, was the first time the agency communicated to its board about the loan. Before then, she said, the agency had only been monitoring the risks. In October, 2017, Westdawn failed to make a payment on its jet loan. This was followed by other alleged breaches in the loan agreement, and within weeks the EDC told the Guptas that it was cancelling the loan. According to the EDC, this was “the first legally appropriate opportunity” to do so. The Guptas ignored the cancellation and denied any breaches. They continued flying around the world in their Bombardier jet, but turned off its public tracking device. In a court application in South Africa, the EDC said there was a “very real concern” that the Guptas might use the aircraft to “escape justice” or for some other “unlawful means.” It alleged that the Guptas might be using “the proceeds of crime” to pay for the airplane. In court documents in February 2018, an EDC official insisted that the agency was “until very recently, unaware of any concrete evidence of serious wrongdoing” by the Guptas. But detailed evidence of Gupta wrongdoing had appeared in South African media and public inquiries for years. Even the EDC itself, in briefing documents for a visit by senior EDC officials to South Africa in 2017, had described how the corruption allegations had “reached the highest level of government” and how Mr. Zuma had been “implicated in numerous investigations for corruption and fraud.” Many of those allegations had directly involved the Guptas. (The documents were obtained by researcher Ken Rubin under the Access to Information Act.) In the court case, a Gupta representative said it was “inconceivable” that EDC officials “can legitimately claim to have been unaware of the regular media coverage of the allegations of unlawful conduct” against the family. By 2018, the Gupta problem was repeatedly on the agenda of high-level government meetings in Ottawa. Briefing papers, obtained by The Globe, showed that senior federal officials were worried that the Gupta loan had caused significant “reputational risk” to the EDC. By now, opposition MPs were raising questions. In March, 2018, Charlie Angus and two other New Democrat MPs sent a letter to François-Philippe Champagne, the international trade minister at the time. They questioned why the EDC was lending money to “corporate outliers” such as the Guptas. There should be a “more thorough ethics screening” so that the EDC would “avoid bad bets like the Guptas,” the MPs said. “Even the most cursory scan of the internet would have revealed that the Gupta brothers had a troubling history of corruption and shady links to President Jacob Zuma.” In response, Mr. Champagne rejected the ethics screening idea, suggesting it might not be legal – and could affect the “confidentiality” of Canadian companies. Mr. Angus said he later met EDC officials, but was dissatisfied with their responses. "The Gupta jet scandal, to me, is something they still haven’t really explained. Heads should have rolled,” he told The Globe. The EDC argues that the Gupta deal was an isolated incident. In 20,000 transactions over the past 80 years, “this is the first time where we’ve gone to court because of the risk of corruption,” the agency said in a March, 2018, statement. Two months later, however, the EDC disclosed to The Globe that it was launching an internal investigation of its US$450-million locomotive loan to Transnet. But the EDC has refused to provide any details about the investigation. Bombardier says it subjects its aircraft transactions to a “robust due diligence and compliance procedure” and decided to sell the jet to the Guptas “based on the information available at the time.” The sale was concluded “at fair market price,” the company says. “It would be erroneous and misleading to analyze a transaction that occurred years ago with the insights and information that are available today,” Bombardier vice-president Olivier Marcil told The Globe in a statement. On the Transnet locomotive contract, “our detailed review of the allegations so far has confirmed that we have always acted in full compliance with the applicable laws and our contractual obligations,” Mr. Marcil said. By 2019, however, the Gupta name had become toxic. The family’s corporate vehicle, Oakbay, was delisted from the Johannesburg stock exchange, and the Guptas were under criminal investigation. International firms such as KPMG, McKinsey and Bell Pottinger have apologized for their dealings with Gupta companies. But the EDC and its supervising cabinet ministers have never provided a full explanation or apology for the EDC’s dealings with the Guptas. As for the notorious airplane: It is now gathering dust in a Johannesburg airport hangar, while the EDC’s local agents search for a buyer.

"283"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-thailands-junta-chief-proclaimed-prime-minister-after-king-endorses/"|"Kaweewit Kaewjinda"|"Thailand’s junta leader was officially proclaimed prime minister on Tuesday after the king endorsed Parliament’s vote for him to serve another term. Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha knelt before a portrait of King Maha Vajiralongkorn and performed three elaborate bows during a ceremony at his government office to confirm his appointment. Prayuth has served as prime minister since he led a military coup that toppled an elected government in 2014. The junta will cease power once a new Cabinet is inaugurated. In a brief live televised speech after the ceremony, he pledged to “dedicate myself to public service with honesty and integrity in pursuit of the greater good of the country and the people of Thailand.” The military government had enacted new election laws that gave Prayuth an advantage in a general election held in March. The new laws authorized a 250-member Senate, appointed by the junta, to take part in the parliamentary vote for prime minister along with an elected 500-member House of Representatives. Prayuth did not contest the election but won last week’s joint parliamentary vote, 500-244, against Future Forward party leader Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit. All junta-appointed senators voted for Prayuth to lead the next government, apart from the Senate speaker, who abstained from voting in line with custom. Critics have expressed doubt whether a government led by Prayuth can fare well in a parliamentary framework, with the parliamentary vote indicating that his coalition has only marginal control over the House, which passes laws and approves budgets. Prayuth’s coalition government includes 18 political parties whose leaders were also present for Tuesday’s ceremony. His appointment was made official after a royal order to announce it was published in the Royal Gazette on Tuesday. The Palang Pracharath Party, which campaigned for Prayuth to lead the next government, won the second-most seats during the March election. The party includes many former members of the military government. Election laws that the junta introduced also weaken traditionally large political parties and the number of seats they could attain while giving seats to smaller parties with fewer votes. The measures are seen as being directed at the Pheu Thai Party, which headed the government deposed in 2014. Pheu Thai, under various names changed for legal reasons, has won every national election since it was founded in 1998 by telecoms tycoon Thaksin Shinawatra, who is despised by the country’s conservative base, which includes the military. Thaksin himself was overthrown as prime minister in a 2006 military coup. The March election was for 500 seats in the lower house. Of those, 350 seats are set aside for the winner of each constituency, while another 150 so-called party list seats are divided among parties based on a proportion of the overall vote derived from a complicated formula that is part of the new measures. Pheu Thai had won the most number of seats in the election by constituency, but it was the only party to be ineligible for any party list seats.

"284"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-iran-revokes-new-york-times-correspondents-accreditation-2/"|"Jon Gambrell"|"Iran has revoked the press accreditation for The New York Times’ correspondent based in Tehran without explanation, the newspaper reported Tuesday. While the newspaper said it remained hopeful Thomas Erdbrink soon would be allowed to work again, the revocation comes amid heightened tensions between the U.S. and Iran stemming from President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers a year ago. Iran pulled Erdbrink’s government-required authorization to work as a journalist four months ago, the Times said. He’s been unable to work since February and the Times said it decided to go public with his situation “after recent speculation and comments on social media.” “Officials of Iran’s Foreign Ministry have repeatedly assured the Times that Mr. Erdbrink’s credential would soon be restored but have offered no explanation for the delays or for why it was revoked,” the Times reported, quoting international editor Michael Slackman. “He added that there are some indications this will be resolved soon.” Dutch public broadcaster NOS, which also employs Erdbrink as a correspondent, quoted him as saying that “important steps” had been taken to resolve the issue, without elaborating. Iran’s mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment. When asked about Erdbrink during a news conference on Tuesday, Iran’s judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili said that Iran allowed many journalists into the country to work. “Regarding this person, I have no information on what has happened,” Esmaili said. Erdbrink, a Dutch national, previously worked as a correspondent for The Washington Post, as well as with other Dutch media. He’s married to Iranian photographer Newsha Tavakolian, who is represented by the Magnum photo agency. Tavakolian also has been barred from working, the Times reported. Magnum did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Both he and Tavakolian were the focus of “Our Man in Tehran,” a 2018 documentary about his work and life as a Western journalist in Iran. Erdbrink also has appeared in bit parts in Farsi movies as well. Journalists in Iran can face harassment from security services, while others have been imprisoned for their work. While local journalists face the brunt of that, foreign journalists in Tehran, especially those with Western ties, have been imprisoned as well. “Working here is like walking a tight rope,” Erdbrink said at one point in “Our Man in Tehran.” The last major case involved Iranian-American reporter Jason Rezaian of the Washington Post, who was convicted in an internationally criticized, closed-door espionage trial in 2015. A 2016 prisoner swap negotiated between Iran and the U.S. amid the start of the nuclear deal freed Rezaian and three other Iranian-Americans in exchange for pardons or charges being dropped against seven Iranians. That deal also saw the U.S. make a $400-million cash delivery to Iran.

"285"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-human-rights-group-says-it-has-identified-hundreds-of-north-korean/"|"Kim Tong-Hyung"|"A human rights group said Tuesday it has identified hundreds of spots where witnesses claim North Korea carried out public executions and extrajudicial state killings as part of an arbitrary and aggressive use of the death penalty that is meant to intimidate its citizens. The Seoul-based Transitional Justice Working Group said its research was based on interviews with 610 North Korean defectors conducted over four years who helped locate the sites with satellite imagery. The group didn’t reveal the exact locations of the 323 sites because it’s worried that North Korea will tamper with them, but said 267 of them were located in two northeastern provinces near the border with China, the area where most of the defectors who participated in the study came from. North Korea’s public executions tend to happen near rivers, in fields and on hills, and also at marketplaces and school grounds – places where residents and family members of those sentenced are often forced to attend the killings, the report said. The group also said it documented three sites where people died while in detention and 25 sites where the dead were allegedly disposed of by the state. It said it also found official locations that may have documents or other evidence related to the killings. The Associated Press could not independently verify the report, and the group acknowledged that its findings weren’t definite because it doesn’t have direct access to North Korea and cannot visit the sites defectors told it about. Ethan Hee-Seok Shin, one of the report’s authors, also said interviews with defectors suggest that public executions in North Korea are becoming less frequent, although it’s unclear whether that’s because more people are being executed in secret. South Korea’s Korea Institute for National Unification, a state-sponsored think-tank, expressed similar views on its annual white paper on North Korea’s human rights released last week. The institute said the North still uses public executions to provoke fear and control the behaviour of its citizens, particularly in city and border areas where crimes are more prevalent. The Transitional Justice Working Group is a nongovernment organization founded by human rights advocates and researchers from South Korea and four other countries. The group said the new report was made possible by funding from the Washington-based National Endowment for Democracy, which is funded by the U.S. Congress. North Korea didn’t immediately respond to the report, but the nation bristles at outside criticism of its human rights record and claims negative assessments are part of U.S.-led pressure campaigns meant to tarnish the image of its leadership and destroy the country’s political system. In a report to the United Nations Human Rights Council in May, North Korea said it “consistently maintains the principle of ensuring scientific accuracy, objectivity and impartiality, as well as protecting human rights in dealing with criminal cases.” A 2014 United Nations report on North Korea’s human rights conditions, however, said state authorities carry out executions, “with or without trial, publicly or secretly,” in response to political and other crimes that are often not among the most serious offences. While public executions were more common in the 1990s, North Korea continues to carry them out for the purpose of instilling fear in the general population, the report said. The new report said its findings show arbitrary executions and extrajudicial killings under state custody have continued under the rule of young leader Kim Jong Un despite international criticism over how North Korea supposedly applies the death penalty without due judicial process. Since assuming leadership in 2011, Kim has shown a brutal side while consolidating his power, executing a slew of members of the North Korean old guard, including his uncle Jang Seong Thaek, who was convicted of treason, and senior officials accused of slighting his leadership. Following a provocative run in nuclear and missile tests, Kim initiated diplomacy with Washington and Seoul in 2018 in attempting to leverage his arsenal for economic and security benefits. But North Korea’s human rights issues have so far been sidelined in the summitry between Kim, President Donald Trump, and South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Almost all of the state killings documented in the report were public executions by firing squad. Public executions in most cases are preceded by brief “trials” on the spot where charges are announced and sentences are issued without legal counsel for the accused, the report said. Criminal charges for executions commonly cited by interviewees included violent crimes such as murder, rape and assault, but also property crimes like stealing copper or cows and brokering defections. With a lack of due process in the North’s judicial system, it’s unclear whether the charges would actually match the act of the accused, the report said. Bodies of people killed by state agents aren’t usually returned to the family and are often dumped in mountainous areas, buried in the ground without markers, or thrown into a gorge or ravine, the report said. Authorities often force family members of those sentenced and residents, including children, to watch public executions. Some defectors reported incidents in the mid-2010s where guards used metal detectors to find and confiscate mobile phones from witnesses to prevent them from recording the events, which showed the government’s concern about information on the public executions getting outside the country, the report said. The rights group said the information it gathered will be crucial if a political transition in North Korea allows for the identification of victims, the return of remains to families and investigations into human rights abuses committed by the government. The group released an earlier report in 2017 based on a smaller number of interviews. It said the new report is better sourced, based on accounts of direct witnesses or those who heard from direct witnesses and were able to provide geographic information of the sites.

A huge floating crane, barges and rescue personnel were working early in the morning at Budapest’s Margit Bridge, where the Hableany (Mermaid) sightseeing boat sank May 29 after colliding with a much larger river cruise ship. The top of the Hableany was visible, as life jackets floated in the boat’s hull. Divers were searching the boat for more victims. Rescuers carried away four body bags on stretchers to a small police cruise boat waiting nearby. Nineteen South Korean tourists and a Hungarian crewman have previously been confirmed dead, with eight people still missing. Seven people were rescued after the nighttime collision amid heavy rain. The lift is planned in several stages, depending, for example, on the condition of the hull as the tour boat is raised off the river floor and the discovery of bodies in the wreckage. The plan detailed Monday by rescuers is to lift the Hableany with the floating crane and place it on a long barge. The boat will then be handed over to police investigating the collision. Efforts to search for the missing victims of the accident and to raise the Hableany have been hindered by the Danube’s high springtime water levels – which are expected to fall significantly over the coming days in Budapest – and the river’s fast flow, as well as near-zero visibility under water. The captain of the other ship in the collision, the Viking Sigyn, has been under arrest since June 1, suspected of endangering water transport leading to a deadly mass accident. The Viking Sigyn, which left Budapest less than 48 hours after the collision with the Hableany, is back in Hungary on a scheduled trip and docked at the town of Visegrad, north of Budapest. Police said they carried out another inspection on the ship on Monday.

Storm Vayu, which formed in the Arabian Sea, is likely to cross the Gujarat coast with gust speeds as high as 135 kmph, the India Meteorological Department said in a statement. It also warned the cyclone could further delay the progress of the annual monsoon rains over the rest of India, as the storm was drawing rain clouds from over the sea. The arrival of the monsoons on the southern coast of Kerala was already about a week late this year. Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani told reporters he had asked for help from the military and the National Disaster Response Force for rescue and relief work in cases the storm causes large scale disruption. Gujarat is also home to large refineries and sea ports that lie near the storm’s path, officials said. A spokesman for Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd said it was preparing to move employees at two ports it runs in the state to safer areas. “Our Mundra and Tuna ports will be closest to the path. The disaster management plan has been put into action and all the necessary precautions are being put in place including evacuation of staff if the need arises,” the spokesman said. India’s biggest oil refinery, owned by Reliance Industries, is also based in Gujarat. A Reliance executive said the cyclone is expected to weaken by the time it reaches the Jamnagar-based refinery. “But in case the course changes or intensifies, the refinery is ready for any contingency,” the executive said, declining to be named because he was not authorized to speak to journalists. Nayara Energy, which is controlled by Russia’s Rosneft and also operates a refinery near Reliance’s unit, said it was monitoring the situation and taking precautionary measures. In May, Cyclone Fani killed at least 34 people on India’s eastern coast, destroying houses and ripping off roofs. Two decades ago, a super-cyclone battered the coast of Odisha for 30 hours, killing 10,000 people. The government plans to start moving some 300,000 people from the most vulnerable areas from Wednesday morning into shelters. Home Minister Amit Shah asked officials to ensure any power, telecommunications and drinking water supplies affected by the cyclone are restored as soon as possible afterwards.

"288"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-rivals-criticize-britains-boris-johnson-for-avoiding-public-scrutiny/"|"Guy Faulconbridge Kylie MacLellan"|"Boris Johnson, the favourite to succeed British Prime Minister Theresa May, was criticized on Tuesday by rivals who said the former foreign minister was avoiding public scrutiny in the contest. After three years of political deadlock over Brexit, the ruling Conservative Party is picking a new leader from 10 candidates and hopes to have a new prime minister in place by the end of July. Johnson, who led the official campaign to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum, is the front-runner to replace May despite a long record of scandals and gaffes. Betting markets give him a 60 per cent probability of winning the top job. But rivals have turned on Johnson over his pledges to cut taxes for the wealthy, deliver Brexit with or without an exit deal and his apparent desire to keep a low profile. Rival Matt Hancock said: “I certainly think that everybody who puts their name forward to be prime minister should be open to scrutiny, should be accountable. “Everybody should participate in the proposed TV debates. And I think we’ve got to ask the question: why not?” he told BBC radio. “I’ve got nothing to hide and that’s why I am here.” When asked about Johnson, Mark Harper, another candidate, said: “If you’ve got nothing to hide, you won’t mind answering questions.” Candidate Andrea Leadsom, said: “The country needs to get their chance to really look at, in detail, the candidates that are up in front of them and Boris will definitely get that scrutiny.” A spokesman for Johnson did not respond to requests for comment. Johnson left his home in London on Tuesday without comment, a Reuters reporter said. He is due to begin his campaign on Wednesday. The United Kingdom could be heading toward a constitutional crisis over Brexit as many of the candidates vying to succeed May are prepared to leave the EU on Oct. 31 without a deal but parliament has indicated it will try to thwart such a scenario. May resigned after repeatedly failing to get parliamentary support for the exit deal she had negotiated with Brussels. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Tuesday reiterated the EU’s refusal to renegotiate the withdrawal deal. A European Commission spokesman, asked about a pledge from Johnson to withhold billions in liabilities owed to the EU’s budget, said: “Everybody knows what is on the table. What is on the table has been approved by all member states and the election of a new prime minister will not change the parameters.” One candidate for the leadership, Rory Stewart, questioned Johnson’s suitability to be prime minister. “Is this the person that you want writing the instructions to the nuclear submarines?,” he said on Tuesday. “Is this the man that you want embodying your nation on the world stage and guiding you through the most difficult choice that Britain has faced for 50 years?” Rivals say Johnson, a former London mayor, is avoiding the limelight because the contest is his to lose – a stray word or poorly placed joke could deprive him of his chance at getting Britain’s top job. Johnson made his name as a European Union-bashing journalist in Brussels, then entered politics in the Conservative Party. He also raised his profile through a series of appearances on a television comedy. He upset some Europeans before Britain’s Brexit referendum by comparing the goals of the EU with those of Adolf Hitler and Napoleon. His eccentric style helped him shrug off a series of scandals, among them getting fired from the party’s policy team while in opposition for lying about an extra-marital affair. Tabloid newspapers dubbed him “Bonking Boris” for those episodes. This might have sunk others, but Johnson became increasingly popular, culminating in his two victories in usually left-leaning London’s mayoral contests in 2008 and 2012. He was considered a favourite for the top job when David Cameron resigned after the 2016 referendum. But his ally, Michael Gove, deserted him and announced his own candidacy. Gove, again one of his main rivals for the leadership, on Monday taunted Johnson, saying, “If I get through, which I am sure I will, actually, to the final two against Mr Johnson, this is what I will say to him: ‘Mr Johnson, whatever you do, don’t pull out’”.

"289"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-amnesty-international-warns-war-crimes-continuing-in-sudans-darfur/"|"Bassam Hatoum Samy Magdy"|"Sudanese security forces have continued to commit “war crimes and other serious human rights violations” in the Darfur region, Amnesty International said Tuesday, as the African country has been rocked by political turmoil following the military’s ouster of autocrat Omar al-Bashir in April. The rights organization said the abuses in Darfur at the hands of Sudanese paramilitary units, the Rapid Support Forces, include the destruction of entire villages, as well as “unlawful killings and sexual violence.” The RSF grew out of the notorious Janjaweed militias mobilized by al-Bashir during the Darfur conflict in the early 2000s. The militias were widely accused of crimes against humanity, and al-Bashir – now jailed in Khartoum – was indicted on charges of genocide. RSF commander Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, better known as Hemedti, now serves as deputy head of the ruling military council. The coup leaders are locked in a growingly violent confrontation with a protest movement that is demanding they hand power over to a civilian leadership, now that al-Bashir is gone. A spokesman for the military council did not immediately answer calls or return messages seeking comment. “In Darfur, as in Khartoum, we’ve witnessed the Rapid Support Forces’ despicable brutality against Sudanese civilians – the only difference being, in Darfur they have committed atrocities with impunity for years,” said Kumi Naidoo, secretary general of Amnesty International. He urged that the UN and the AU “not turn their backs on people in Darfur who rely on peacekeepers for protection.” He warned that if the joint force, known as UNAMID, is dismantled and the peacekeepers pull out of Darfur, this “would recklessly and needlessly place tens of thousands of lives at risk by removing their only safeguard against the government’s scorched earth campaign.” The UN said Monday that Sudan’s military rulers issued a decree demanding the mission in Darfur hand over its premises as part of its withdrawal plan next year. The UN is to vote at the end of the month about the future of the already reduced force. The target for ending the mission is June 30, 2020. The Human Rights Watch said Tuesday that, based on the peacekeeping mission’s own reports, the Rapid Support Forces now occupy nine of 10 sites vacated by the UN force within the past eight months. The Security Council “should halt all handovers, reassess downsizing plans, and refocus its attention on UNAMID’s core mandate to protect civilians,” said Jehanne Henry, associate Africa director at HRW. The New York-based group said the RSF violently broke up the protesters’ main sit-in camp outside the military’s headquarters in Khartoum on June 3. Over 100 people were killed in the deadly crackdown on the pro-reform movement in Khartoum and elsewhere across Sudan, according to protest organizers. In response, the opposition started a general strike on Sunday, the first day of the workweek in Sudan, in a renewed bid to pressure the military council to hand over power to civilians. The Forces for Declaration of Freedom and Change, which represents the protesters, said Tuesday they decided to suspend their general strike and campaign for civil disobedience until further notice. They called on Sudanese to resume their work on Wednesday. The military-run government did not appear to be softening its position. The strike was successful in the first day, according to protest leaders, but on Tuesday many shops and businesses reopened and there was visibly more traffic in the streets of Khartoum and its sister city of Omdurman. Meanwhile, an Ethiopian envoy said negotiations between the military council and the protest leaders would resume “soon.” Mahmoud Dirir told a news conference in Khartoum on Tuesday that all previous deals between both sides have been restored and that the new talks would focus on the makeup of the disputed sovereign council. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has been trying to revive negotiations between the generals and the protest leaders and has visited Khartoum. The internet monitoring group NetBlocks said that Sudan’s remaining internet connectivity was disconnected late Monday. Internet had largely been cut off in the capital already. The new disruption has downed Sudan Telecom’s Sudani service, along with Canar Telecom and Mobiltel Zain. Mobile internet connectivity has been largely offline since June 3, the group said. Also on Tuesday, the Sudan Doctors Central Committee said that RSF forces attacked a market the previous day in the town of Deleig in central Darfur. The medical group said it documented 11 deaths, including nine which it blamed on the paramilitary force members. It said the attack wounded at least 20 people. The committee is the medical arm of the Sudanese Professionals Association, which spearheaded protests against al-Bashir and is now leading a campaign of civil disobedience against the military rulers. The UN humanitarian agency said customs offices at Port Sudan, the country’s main port, were open on Monday and resumed their functions with limited capacities. Also the UN humanitarian air services operated as normal Monday, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said.

In his first comments after arriving in his native Lebanon, Nizar Zakka denied reports that his release was part of a wider deal but suggested that it had helped avert further escalation in the region. Zakka’s release comes amid heightened tensions between Iran and the U.S. after President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers. It comes against the backdrop of high-stakes diplomatic activity aimed at easing tensions between the two foes. “The initiative, from beginning to end, was born in Lebanon. … But I won’t deny that this initiative had positive results on the region and appears to have stopped much of what might have happened,” Zakka told reporters shortly after arriving in Lebanon. Zakka is one of several prisoners with either dual nationality or links to the West held in Iran. Lebanese officials have for years asked for his release, and it was not clear why Iran decided to act now. The White House said it was “thankful” for Zakka’s release but wants to see other Americans who are detained there released as well. “We’re thankful for the release of the individual in Iran,” press secretary Sarah Sanders said. “The big question is there’s several others and we want to see those people released as well.” Sanders declined to say whether the U.S. government was involved in securing Zakka’s release. The U.S. State Department later released a statement welcoming Zakka’s release from his “unlawful imprisonment.” “We hope that Mr. Zakka’s release is a positive sign for American detainees in Iran,” it added, referring to several U.S. citizens who remain in detention in Iran. Flanked by his wife and siblings, Zakka spoke at the presidential palace, his first stop after arriving on a private plane at Beirut airport. He was accompanied by the chief of Lebanon’s General Security Directorate, Maj. Gen. Abbas Ibrahim, who had travelled to the Iranian capital to bring him home. Wearing a dark suit and tie, Zakka flashed reporters the victory sign and hugged his brother Ziad before he went into a meeting with President Michel Aoun, who had personally requested his release. “Mr. president, my family and I owe you for the rest of my life for what you did in order for me to win my freedom,” Zakka said after the meeting. “I went there (to Iran) upon an official invitation to a country where I was kidnapped.” Zakka, an information technology expert, was arrested in Iran in September 2015 while trying to fly out of Tehran. He had just attended a conference there at the invitation of one of the country’s vice-presidents. The following year, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison after authorities accused him of being an American spy – allegations vigorously rejected by his family and associates. Earlier on Tuesday, an Iranian judiciary official confirmed that Tehran has agreed to hand over Zakka to Lebanese officials, providing the first official confirmation of his release, which had been anticipated for days. “A court has accepted the condition of freedom for Nizar Zakka and he will be handed over to Lebanese officials,” judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili said, according to the judiciary’s Mizan news agency. A report Monday on the Iranian state TV’s website mirrored an earlier one carried by the semi-official Fars news agency about Zakka. State TV, like Fars, quoted an anonymous source saying Zakka’s forthcoming release should only be seen as a “sign of respect” for the Lebanese militant Hezbollah group and its leader, Hassan Nasrallah. “In this regard, no negotiations have taken place at any level with any person or any government,” state TV said. Esmaili stressed that Zakka’s release was within “the frame of the law.” “We reviewed the (Lebanese) president’s request through the Supreme National Security Council,” Esmaili said. “Also, the Lebanese Hezbollah group considered the approval of his freedom as prudent.” The leader of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah has not made public comments about Zakka’s imprisonment, but pro-Hezbollah media have said that Nasrallah had in recent days urged the Iranians to facilitate his release. Zakka, who lives in Washington and holds resident status in the U.S., leads the Arab ICT Organization, or IJMA3, an industry consortium from 13 countries that advocates for information technology in the region. In 2016, The Associated Press reported that Zakka’s supporters wrote to then-Secretary of State John Kerry, stating Zakka travelled to Iran “with the knowledge and approval of the U.S. State Department, and his trip was funded by grants” from it. Zakka’s IJMA3 organization had received at least $730,000 in contracts and grants since 2009 from both the State Department and USAID, the lead American government agency fighting poverty and promoting democracy across the world. The State Department has yet to respond to a years-old request from the AP for information about those grants. Shahindokht Molaverdi, an adviser to President Hassan Rouhani who as a vice-president invited Zakka to Iran, told the AP in September that Iran’s government had “failed” to help Zakka, who was arrested by the country’s elite Revolutionary Guard, which answers directly to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. “This is in no way approved by the government,” Molaverdi said. “We did all we could to stop this from happening, but we are seeing that we have failed to make a significant impact.” "|"U.S. resident Nizar Zakka says his release from Iranian detention helped ease tensions"|"2019-06-11T14:19:10-0400"|"Iran,Nizar Zakka,United States,Lebanon,news,world,Iran nuclear deal,Iran-U.S. tensions,Donald Trump,zakka,iran,release,lebanon,Zakka,initiative", 
"291"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-hong-kong-braces-for-more-protests-over-china-extradition-bill/"|"Nathan VanderKlippe"|"Protesters crowded onto the streets of downtown Hong Kong Wednesday morning, installing barriers on roads and snarling traffic as they prepared for a day of action to protest a bill that would make it easier for authorities in China to extradite people from the city. Just before 11 a.m., members of the city’s Legislative Council said a scheduled debate on the bill had been unexpectedly postponed, as the city’s political leaders pleaded for peace with a crowd of tens of thousands who took over downtown streets. Police used pepper spray and water cannons against some protesters. Legislative Council member Alvin Yeung said it was not clear when the meeting would resume. He spoke from a small opening between chanting protesters and police behind large clear plastic shields, who he had come to address in hopes of preserving peace. “We were asking to speak directly to the most senior rank commanding officer on site to give the person the clearest message that do not use force on these innocent Hong Kong people,” Mr. Yeung said. “They do not have to bear this responsibility. It’s a political issue.” He came with Jeremy Tam, another council member, who had a simple message: “As soon as they withdraw this bill, all these people will be gone.” But by noon Wednesday, there was no sign of the crowd dispersing, a large group clad in black, many with masks and some wearing helmets. They erected barricades and lashed them together with zip ties, shutting down main arteries in the financial heart of the city. They came on a day when social workers, church groups, student associations and workers alliances called for a general strike to allow people to protest the extradition bill. Legislators initially expected to hold a debate toward a second reading of the bill on Wednesday. It could be passed by the end of the month, political analysts have said. People are “angry. Very angry,” said Nicole Cheng, 22, who came Tuesday night dressed in black and prepared to stay up all night. “Because the government doesn’t listen at all.” The issue has divided Hong Kong, with hundreds of thousands signing a petition in support, and hundreds of thousands more – a million joined a Sunday march, by organizers’ count – taking to the streets to protest legislation they see as dangerous to the city’s freedoms. Unlike the co-ordinated Sunday demonstration that filled three kilometres of streets with an orderly procession, calls to protest this week emerged from numerous places, with a wide variety of proposed actions – including demonstrations and a mass cash withdrawal of U.S. dollars, in hopes of affecting the region’s foreign reserves. The sheer number of calls for civil disobedience threatened to open a new chapter of disarray in a city that has long prided itself on its orderly conduct. Local media reported death threats against Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam, who has pushed forward the extradition bill with Beijing’s backing. Among the groups pledging action Wednesday were small businesses – including bakeries and law firms – saying they would close up shop. Major banks and consultancies advised their employees to use flexible work arrangements in anticipation of disruptions to the city’s downtown core, its commercial heart studded with some of the world’s wealthiest financial institutions. “With Hong Kong being a financial city and society very polarized at the moment, we don’t expect a complete or near complete participation from all schools and companies. But every little bit helps,” said Jason Y. Ng, convener of the Progressive Lawyers Group. “We're doing all this because we genuinely worry about what the extradition bill may do to our personal safety and free expression. But more importantly, we are pushing back because we want to send a message to the government and Beijing that we won't take this lying down.” Political leadership in Hong Kong and Beijing have shown no willingness to alter the extradition bill or delay its passage. The legal amendments would allow Hong Kong to extradite those accused of serious crimes to jurisdictions with which it has no formal extradition agreements – including mainland China. Though the bill is intended to allow for extradition only in the case of serious criminal allegations, lawyers and protesters alike say they are concerned Chinese courts, which answer to the Communist Party, will fabricate accusations in order to secure the arrest of people on political grounds. “People have a strong feeling that the passage of the bill will significantly remove the firewall between the two systems, and would expose Hong Kong people to the realistic danger of being sent back to China for trial,” said Albert Ho, a lawyer and former legislator. That prospect has made the bill a focal point for unease over Beijing’s efforts to integrate the city into the mainland. Hong Kong was promised a high degree of autonomy under the “one country, two systems” formulation when it was handed over to Chinese control in 1997. The city retains a dramatically different social and political environment, with open Internet access, respected courts and a freedom to assemble express the sorts of critical thought that would result in arrest and imprisonment for people in China. But China under president Xi Jinping has pursued an increasingly assertive foreign policy, and worry has grown that Hong Kong’s liberties are eroding as Beijing exerts control. In 2014, Beijing rejected demands for greater local democratic control that led protesters to take over city streets for three months during the so-called “Umbrella Revolution.” A new bridge and high-speed rail links have made Hong Kong a node on China’s national infrastructure network. The extradition bill promises to forge new judicial links, too, between Hong Kong and China. Political analysts say its passage is a foregone conclusion. Still, “we just feel that we should stand up and say no,” said Mr. Ho. “That is all we can do now, and it’s the only thing that we should do.” Among those standing Tuesday night was Henry Kam, a recent university graduate. “Although I can’t do anything because they are so strong,” he said, referring to China, “I can be one of those who join the protest. Power comes from people coming together.” "|"Hong Kong legislators postpone debate on China extradition bill as protesters flood streets"|"2019-06-11T16:17:27-0400"|"Hong Kong,extradition bill,legislature,protests in Hong Kong,street protests,city,bill,people,china,beijing,control,hong,kong,Legislative Council,Carrie Lam", 
"292"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-us-formally-submits-extradition-request-for-wikileaks-founder-julian/"|"Paul Waldie"|"The legal battle over Julian Assange’s extradition to the United States is set to begin in a London courtroom on Friday, but one of his closest supporters doubts the WikiLeaks founder has any chance of success in court. “I don’t believe that we are going to win this with legal arguments,” said the Icelandic journalist Kristinn Hrafnsson, a long-time friend of Mr. Assange who is also editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks. "That’s why I urge people to mobilize and actually to put pressure [on governments]. There is no chance that Julian will get a fair trial here [in Britain], or in the U.S. of course, unless there’s a change of reporting, that people actually start speaking out. We’re not talking about a prosecution, we’re talking about a persecution.” Mr. Assange, 47, is wanted in the U.S. on charges relating to WikiLeaks’s publication of thousands of military files in 2010, including reports of atrocities by U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. In an 18-count indictment unveiled last month, the U.S. Justice Department alleged Mr. Assange violated the Espionage Act by “unlawfully obtaining and disclosing classified documents related to the national defence.” Mr. Assange is serving a 50-week jail sentence in Britain for skipping bail in 2012 when he faced extradition to Sweden in a case involving allegations of sexual assault. He sought refuge in the Ecuadoran embassy in London and remained there until last April, when the embassy turned him over to British police. Mr. Assange insisted he wasn’t hiding from the Swedish case but feared Britain would hand him over to the United States. A Swedish court recently ruled that Mr. Assange should not be extradited for the sexual-assault case, but investigators still want to question him in London. Mr. Assange is a divisive figure, and the case against him in the U.S. has sparked a heated debate about who is a journalist and what constitutes news gathering in the age of social media. The Espionage Act dates back to 1917 when the U.S. had just entered the First World War. It prohibits anyone from obtaining and publishing information relating to national defence, or inducing someone to hand over information. The law has been used rarely and never against a journalist. U.S. Justice officials have insisted that Mr. Assange is not a journalist and that the case doesn’t impede freedom of the press. “Some say that Assange is a journalist and that he should be immune from prosecution for these actions,” John Demers, the Assistant Attorney-General for National Security, said when the indictment was filed last month. “Julian Assange is no journalist. … Indeed, no responsible actor – journalist or otherwise – would purposely publish the names of individuals he or she knew to be confidential human sources in war zones, exposing them to the gravest of dangers.” During a media briefing Tuesday in London, Mr. Hrafnsson said the case against Mr. Assange strikes at the heart of what journalists do: obtain information, or encourage others to provide information, and then publish the contents. Indeed, many newspapers, including The Globe and Mail, have a “secure drop” service that allows people to share sensitive material. That kind of activity could be illegal in the U.S. if Mr. Assange were convicted. “It can’t be overstated how important this case is for press freedom,” Mr. Hrafnsson said. He added that many governments have become emboldened by the Assange case to go after journalists; he cited recent police raids on the offices of reporters in Australia and San Francisco. “This is an attack on journalists and it’s all interlinked,” he said. Christophe Marchand, a human-rights lawyer who is part of Mr. Assange’s legal team, said the WikiLeaks founder hasn’t been given a fair hearing in Britain, and he cited cabinet ministers, such as Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who has said Mr. Assange should be extradited. Mr. Marchand also referred to a recent statement by a United Nations official who urged Britain not to extradite Mr. Assange because he won’t get a fair trial in the United States. Nils Melzer, the UN Special Rapporteur on torture, met Mr. Assange in prison last month and raised concerns about his inability to meet with lawyers or prepare a case. “My most urgent concern is that, in the United States, Mr. Assange would be exposed to a real risk of serious violations of his human rights,” Mr. Melzer said. Mr. Assange’s extradition case is expected to last several months, and in the meantime his health has deteriorated. Mr. Hrafnsson said Mr. Assange had been transferred to the prison hospital and it’s unclear whether he will be able to attend Friday’s hearing.

"293"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-semyon-rozenfeld-last-known-survivor-of-death-camp-escape-dies-at-96-2/"|"Palko Karasz"|"Semyon Rozenfeld first escaped death in the gas chambers by inventing a trade for himself when he arrived at Sobibor, a Nazi death camp in occupied Poland, in the fall of 1943. Questioned by a German officer, he said he was a glazier and was taken aside for work detail. About a month later he was among about 600 prisoners who staged a historic uprising against their captors and tried to escape. Only about 300 made it to the fences, and most of the rest were recaptured in the surrounding countryside. But some managed to make it to freedom, Mr. Rozenfeld among them. He died at 96 on Monday at a hospital in Rehovot, Israel, near Tel Aviv, and was believed to be the last known survivor of Sobibor. The Jewish Agency for Israel confirmed his death. He was cited as the last survivor after the death of Selma Wynberg Engel last December in East Haven, Conn., also at 96. She had been one of the first to tell the world of the camp’s existence. Mr. Rozenfeld was born in 1922 in Ukraine, the son of a tailor. He was drafted by the Red Army before falling prisoner to the Germans and was held first in Minsk, in today’s Belarus, and later in Sobibor. The camp in Sobibor began operating in the spring of 1942 as part of Operation Reinhard, the Nazi plan to exterminate Polish Jews. Only a small minority of detainees were allowed to work, mostly in operating the camp, including the disposal of bodies. Most people were killed in gas chambers shortly after their arrival. At least 167,000 people and possibly as many as 350,000 were murdered there. Mr. Rozenfeld was part of a group of prisoners who planned an escape in October, 1943. They were to kill as many guards as they could with knives and axes before storming the main gate. They vowed to tell the world what had happened at Sobibor. In testimony to the Ghetto Fighters’ House museum, Mr. Rozenfeld said Alexander Pechersky, who led the escape, had asked him if he felt capable of killing someone with an axe. “I’m not capable of killing a human being,” Mr. Rozenfeld recalled saying. “But a Nazi – yes.” On Oct. 14, the revolt was set in motion. Hundreds of prisoners didn’t make it out of the camp, but 300 or so did, under fire, and then only to face minefields. Mr. Rozenfeld climbed a nine-foot fence and kept running despite a bullet wound to his leg. “I was not afraid,” he said, “because I didn’t have time to think about fear. I only thought about life.” Those who escaped and made it through the minefields went into hiding in the surrounding forest, and some sought help from local residents. Many prisoners were captured by Nazi guards and Polish collaborators. The camp was closed soon after the revolt. Fewer than 60 escapees survived the war. The last of the guards to be tried for killing Jews at Sobibor was John Demjanjuk, a former auto worker in Ohio. In 2011, in a German court, he was found guilty of taking part in the murder of 28,000 people and sentenced to five years in prison. He died in a nursing home in 2012 while appealing the conviction. As the Red Army arrived in the city of Chelm, where Mr. Rozenfeld had taken refuge, Mr. Rozenfeld again joined their ranks and fought to liberate Berlin. He returned to Ukraine, married and lived there until moving to Israel in 1990. He was most recently living in a nursing home in Yad Binyamin, south of Tel Aviv. He leaves two sons, Michael and Roman; four grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.

"294"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-climate-change-could-reduce-global-sea-life-by-17-per-cent-study/"|"Seth Borenstein"|"The world’s oceans will likely lose about one-sixth of their fish and other marine life by the end of the century if climate change continues on its current path, a new study says. Every degree Celsius that the world’s oceans warm, the total mass of sea animals is projected to drop by 5 per cent, according to a comprehensive computer-based study by an international team of marine biologists. And that does not include effects of fishing. If the world’s greenhouse gas emissions stay at the present rate, that means a 17-per-cent loss of biomass – the total weight of all the marine animal life – by the year 2100, according to Tuesday’s study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. But if the world reduces carbon pollution, losses can be limited to only about 5 per cent, the study said. “We will see a large decrease in the biomass of the oceans,” if the world doesn’t slow climate change, said study co-author William Cheung, a marine ecologist at the University of British Columbia. “There are already changes that have been observed.” While warmer water is the biggest factor, climate change also produces oceans that are more acidic and have less oxygen, which also harms sea life, Prof. Cheung said. Much of the world relies on the oceans for food or livelihood, scientists say. “The potential ramifications of these predicted losses are huge, not just for ocean biodiversity, but because people around the world rely on ocean resources,” said University of Victoria biology professor Julia Baum, who wasn’t part of the study but says it makes sense. “Climate change has the potential to cause serious new conflicts over ocean resource use and global food security, particularly as human population continues to grow this century.” The biggest animals in the oceans are going to be hit hardest, said study co-author Derek Tittensor, a marine ecologist at the United Nations World Conservation Monitoring Centre in England. “The good news here is that the main building blocks of marine life, plankton and bacteria may decline less heavily, the bad news is that those marine animals that we use directly, and care about most deeply, are predicted to suffer the most as climate change is working its way up the food chain,” co-author Boris Worm, a marine biologist at Dalhousie University in Canada, said in an e-mail. Tropical areas, already warm, will also see the biggest losses, Prof. Cheung said. Scientists had already thought that climate change will likely reduce future ocean life, but past computer simulations looked at only part of the picture or used only one model. This study uses six different state-of-the-art computer models that give the best big-picture look yet, Prof. Cheung said. It is hard to separate past climate change impacts from those of fishing, but past studies have shown places where observed fish loss can be attributed to human-caused climate change, Prof. Cheung added. Mr. Tittensor pointed to lobsters off Maine and North Atlantic right whales as examples of creatures already being hurt by global warming hitting the ocean. University of Georgia marine biologist Samantha Joye, who wasn’t part of the research, praised the study as meticulous and said it is also “an urgent call for action.” “Healthy oceans are required for planetary stability,” Prof. Joye said in an e-mail. “Aggressive global action to slow climate change is a moral imperative.” "|"Climate change could reduce global sea life by 17 per cent, study says"|"2019-06-11T14:12:32-0400"|"climate change,global warming,oceans,sea life,fish,environmental impact,study,world,ocean,news,change,life,loss,university,University of British Columbia", 
"295"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-ugandan-child-tests-positive-for-ebola-in-first-case-outside-congo/"|"Rodney Muhumuza"|"A child in Uganda has tested positive for Ebola in the first cross-border case of the deadly virus since an outbreak started in neighbouring Congo last year, Uganda’s health ministry said late Tuesday, in a blow to efforts by health workers who for months sought to prevent contamination across the heavily travelled frontier. The 5-year-old Congolese boy has been isolated with family members at a hospital in a western district near the Congo border, Ugandan Health Minister Jane Aceng told reporters. Two family members were being tested for Ebola after developing symptoms, with results expected on Wednesday. The announcement puts new pressure on the World Health Organization to declare the Ebola outbreak – the second-deadliest in history – a global health emergency. The outbreak is unfolding amid unprecedented challenges of rebel attacks and community resistance in a region that had never experienced Ebola before. In April a WHO expert committee decided that the outbreak, while of “deep concern,” was not yet a global health emergency . But international spread is one of the major criteria the United Nations agency considers before such a declaration. It was not immediately clear when the boy entered Uganda. A WHO statement said he entered on Sunday with his family through the Bwera border post. He sought treatment at Kagando hospital and was transferred to Bwera Ebola treatment unit, WHO said. Confirmation of Ebola was made on Tuesday by the Uganda Virus Institute. “The ministry of health and WHO have dispatched a rapid response team to Kasese to identify other people who may be at risk,” WHO said. Congo’s health ministry in a separate statement said the boy, from Mabalako, arrived on Monday at Congo’s Kasindi border post. There, a dozen family members appeared to have symptoms and were transferred to an isolation centre at the local hospital for observation. Six family members then broke away while being transferred to an Ebola treatment centre in Beni and crossed into Uganda while Congolese border officials alerted their Ugandan colleagues, Congo’s health ministry said. Uganda officials found the family members at the Kagando hospital, where the boy’s Ebola case was confirmed. Officials from the two countries will meet on Wednesday about the possibility of sending the family back to Beni in Congo for treatment, the health ministry said. It was not immediately clear how the family members were able to cross the border, where millions have travellers have been screened for Ebola since the outbreak began. WHO has advised against travel restrictions. There have been more than 2,000 confirmed and probable cases of the Ebola virus in Congo since August, with nearly 1,400 deaths. The disease is spread mainly through contact with the bodily fluids of those infected. For the first time an experimental but effective Ebola vaccine is being widely used, with more than 130,000 doses distributed. Uganda has vaccinated nearly 4,700 health workers, WHO said. The East African country has had multiple outbreaks of Ebola and other hemorrhagic fevers since 2000. “The spread of Ebola across the international border is a clear signal that the international community must reset and redouble its efforts” in fighting the disease, the International Rescue Committee said in a statement calling itself “extremely alarmed.” Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day’s most important headlines.

Peter Dalglish, a globe-trotting advocate for children who held multiple United Nations posts, was accused of sexually abusing the two boys, who provided graphic but inconsistent accounts of what they said Mr. Dalglish did to them. Police also found pictures of naked children in his home, although, Mr. Dalglish has argued those images were innocent in nature. A court in Nepal found him guilty this week, although, it has not yet released the detailed text of the verdict. Sentencing is not likely to take place for another month. The verdict comes after a series of delays in court proceedings that Mr. Dalglish’s legal counsel has likened to harassment. “It just shows that they wanted him in prison,” said Rahul Chapagain, a Kathmandu-based lawyer who has represented him. Mr. Dalglish did not speak when the verdict was delivered, Mr. Chapagain said. “Obviously, we took the news as a shock, but we sustained him. He was relatively calm,” Mr. Chapagain said. Friends in Nepal were present, as were Canadian diplomats, he said. “We respect the court’s decision, but we will appeal,” he added. The case against Mr. Dalglish has been marked by vivid allegations and dramatic contradictions. Mr. Dalglish was arrested at gunpoint on April 7, 2018. The two boys who made allegations against him were in the house at the time. But those boys, 12 and 14 at the time, have given different accounts of what took place, according to lawyers for Mr. Dalglish. According to court documents and Nepal police, Mr. Dalglish acknowledged abusing children shortly after his arrest, saying he had himself been sexually assaulted as a boy. But Mr. Dalglish subsequently denied that admission, blaming it on a translation error. He told The Globe and Mail in a detention centre interview in April, 2018, that he had “never” done the things he was accused of. Police also discovered photographs of naked children in Mr. Dalglish’s home. His lawyer has said the photos showed impoverished children he had encountered on his travels around the world. A third person who made detailed allegations against Mr. Dalglish to police subsequently invalidated each of his own statements while in court. Over the course of his career, Mr. Dalglish delivered aid to famine-struck Ethiopia, worked with the children of murdered parents in Guatemala, evacuated children from war-torn Sudan, taught sex workers’ children in India, responded to the Ebola crisis in Liberia, founded an organization that helped street kids around the world and oversaw skills training in Afghanistan. He often paid school fees for poor children, took them on international trips and invited them to his home. Mr. Dalglish is a former teacher at Upper Canada College who worked at the school between 1998 and 2002. After his arrest last year, the school sent an e-mail to parents and alumni asking anyone with knowledge of any inappropriate conduct involving Mr. Dalglish to come forward. “To date, no one has let us know that they were a victim of inappropriate conduct by Mr. Dalglish during his time as a teacher at the College,” Marnie Peters, a spokesperson for UCC, wrote in an e-mail. He later became executive director of the South Asia Children’s Fund, senior adviser to the AWR Lloyd Foundation and a technical adviser on a series of United Nations-related postings. He wrote two books, including The Courage of Children: My Life with the World’s Poorest Kids. He was awarded the Order of Canada in 2016. His citation from the governor-general’s office says he “has devoted his life to helping children escape poverty.” Mr. Dalglish, according to Mr. Chapagain, remains “relatively healthy.” The Canadian man’s prison routine has included daily walks of 10 to 15 kilometres. “He counts his steps and everything. He is keeping his mind and his body sound, even in this challenging time,” Mr. Chapagain said.

Mr. Assange insisted he wasn’t hiding from the Swedish case but feared Britain would hand him over to the United States. A Swedish court recently ruled that Mr. Assange should not be extradited for the sexual-assault case, but investigators still want to question him in London. Mr. Assange is a divisive figure, and the case against him in the U.S. has sparked a heated debate about who is a journalist and what constitutes news gathering in the age of social media. The Espionage Act dates back to 1917 when the U.S. had just entered the First World War. It prohibits anyone from obtaining and publishing information relating to national defence, or inducing someone to hand over information. The law has been used rarely and never against a journalist. U.S. Justice officials have insisted that Mr. Assange is not a journalist and that the case doesn’t impede freedom of the press. “Some say that Assange is a journalist and that he should be immune from prosecution for these actions,” John Demers, the Assistant Attorney-General for National Security, said when the indictment was filed last month. “Julian Assange is no journalist. … Indeed, no responsible actor – journalist or otherwise – would purposely publish the names of individuals he or she knew to be confidential human sources in war zones, exposing them to the gravest of dangers.” During a media briefing Tuesday in London, Mr. Hrafnsson said the case against Mr. Assange strikes at the heart of what journalists do: obtain information, or encourage others to provide information, and then publish the contents. Indeed, many newspapers, including The Globe and Mail, have a “secure drop” service that allows people to share sensitive material. That kind of activity could be illegal in the U.S. if Mr. Assange were convicted. “It can’t be overstated how important this case is for press freedom,” Mr. Hrafnsson said. He added that many governments have become emboldened by the Assange case to go after journalists; he cited recent police raids on the offices of reporters in Australia and San Francisco. “This is an attack on journalists and it’s all interlinked,” he said. Christophe Marchand, a human-rights lawyer who is part of Mr. Assange’s legal team, said the WikiLeaks founder hasn’t been given a fair hearing in Britain, and he cited cabinet ministers, such as Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who has said Mr. Assange should be extradited. Mr. Marchand also referred to a recent statement by a United Nations official who urged Britain not to extradite Mr. Assange because he won’t get a fair trial in the United States. Nils Melzer, the UN Special Rapporteur on torture, met Mr. Assange in prison last month and raised concerns about his inability to meet with lawyers or prepare a case. “My most urgent concern is that, in the United States, Mr. Assange would be exposed to a real risk of serious violations of his human rights,” Mr. Melzer said. Mr. Assange’s extradition case is expected to last several months, and in the meantime his health has deteriorated. Mr. Hrafnsson said Mr. Assange had been transferred to the prison hospital and it’s unclear whether he will be able to attend Friday’s hearing.

"298"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-in-hong-kong-thousands-spend-night-on-streets-as-legislators-prepare/"|"Nathan VanderKlippe"|"Protesters crowded onto the streets of downtown Hong Kong Wednesday morning, installing barriers on roads and snarling traffic as they prepared for a day of action to protest a bill that would make it easier for authorities in China to extradite people from the city. Just before 11 a.m., members of the city’s Legislative Council said a scheduled debate on the bill had been unexpectedly postponed, as the city’s political leaders pleaded for peace with a crowd of tens of thousands who took over downtown streets. Police used pepper spray and water cannons against some protesters. Legislative Council member Alvin Yeung said it was not clear when the meeting would resume. He spoke from a small opening between chanting protesters and police behind large clear plastic shields, who he had come to address in hopes of preserving peace. “We were asking to speak directly to the most senior rank commanding officer on site to give the person the clearest message that do not use force on these innocent Hong Kong people,” Mr. Yeung said. “They do not have to bear this responsibility. It’s a political issue.” He came with Jeremy Tam, another council member, who had a simple message: “As soon as they withdraw this bill, all these people will be gone.” But by noon Wednesday, there was no sign of the crowd dispersing, a large group clad in black, many with masks and some wearing helmets. They erected barricades and lashed them together with zip ties, shutting down main arteries in the financial heart of the city. They came on a day when social workers, church groups, student associations and workers alliances called for a general strike to allow people to protest the extradition bill. Legislators initially expected to hold a debate toward a second reading of the bill on Wednesday. It could be passed by the end of the month, political analysts have said. People are “angry. Very angry,” said Nicole Cheng, 22, who came Tuesday night dressed in black and prepared to stay up all night. “Because the government doesn’t listen at all.” The issue has divided Hong Kong, with hundreds of thousands signing a petition in support, and hundreds of thousands more – a million joined a Sunday march, by organizers’ count – taking to the streets to protest legislation they see as dangerous to the city’s freedoms. Unlike the co-ordinated Sunday demonstration that filled three kilometres of streets with an orderly procession, calls to protest this week emerged from numerous places, with a wide variety of proposed actions – including demonstrations and a mass cash withdrawal of U.S. dollars, in hopes of affecting the region’s foreign reserves. The sheer number of calls for civil disobedience threatened to open a new chapter of disarray in a city that has long prided itself on its orderly conduct. Local media reported death threats against Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam, who has pushed forward the extradition bill with Beijing’s backing. Among the groups pledging action Wednesday were small businesses – including bakeries and law firms – saying they would close up shop. Major banks and consultancies advised their employees to use flexible work arrangements in anticipation of disruptions to the city’s downtown core, its commercial heart studded with some of the world’s wealthiest financial institutions. “With Hong Kong being a financial city and society very polarized at the moment, we don’t expect a complete or near complete participation from all schools and companies. But every little bit helps,” said Jason Y. Ng, convener of the Progressive Lawyers Group. “We're doing all this because we genuinely worry about what the extradition bill may do to our personal safety and free expression. But more importantly, we are pushing back because we want to send a message to the government and Beijing that we won't take this lying down.” Political leadership in Hong Kong and Beijing have shown no willingness to alter the extradition bill or delay its passage. The legal amendments would allow Hong Kong to extradite those accused of serious crimes to jurisdictions with which it has no formal extradition agreements – including mainland China. Though the bill is intended to allow for extradition only in the case of serious criminal allegations, lawyers and protesters alike say they are concerned Chinese courts, which answer to the Communist Party, will fabricate accusations in order to secure the arrest of people on political grounds. “People have a strong feeling that the passage of the bill will significantly remove the firewall between the two systems, and would expose Hong Kong people to the realistic danger of being sent back to China for trial,” said Albert Ho, a lawyer and former legislator. That prospect has made the bill a focal point for unease over Beijing’s efforts to integrate the city into the mainland. Hong Kong was promised a high degree of autonomy under the “one country, two systems” formulation when it was handed over to Chinese control in 1997. The city retains a dramatically different social and political environment, with open Internet access, respected courts and a freedom to assemble express the sorts of critical thought that would result in arrest and imprisonment for people in China. But China under president Xi Jinping has pursued an increasingly assertive foreign policy, and worry has grown that Hong Kong’s liberties are eroding as Beijing exerts control. In 2014, Beijing rejected demands for greater local democratic control that led protesters to take over city streets for three months during the so-called “Umbrella Revolution.” A new bridge and high-speed rail links have made Hong Kong a node on China’s national infrastructure network. The extradition bill promises to forge new judicial links, too, between Hong Kong and China. Political analysts say its passage is a foregone conclusion. Still, “we just feel that we should stand up and say no,” said Mr. Ho. “That is all we can do now, and it’s the only thing that we should do.” Among those standing Tuesday night was Henry Kam, a recent university graduate. “Although I can’t do anything because they are so strong,” he said, referring to China, “I can be one of those who join the protest. Power comes from people coming together.” "|"Hong Kong legislators postpone debate on China extradition bill as protesters flood streets"|"2019-06-11T16:17:27-0400"|"Hong Kong,extradition bill,legislature,protests in Hong Kong,street protests,city,bill,people,china,beijing,control,hong,kong,Legislative Council,Carrie Lam",

Twenty-six Koreans and two Hungarian crew died after the Mermaid tourist boat capsized and sank in seconds – the worst disaster on the river in half a century. Prosecutors said the Ukrainian captain of the larger Viking Sigyn cruiser – identified by police as 64-year-old C. Yuriy from Odessa – had been held on suspicion of criminal misconduct. The captain’s legal team has said he is devastated by what happened, but denies any wrongdoing. South Korea’s government had formally asked for the captain to be kept in detention as it sent divers and officials to help the Hungarian investigation. But the captain’s lawyer, Gabor Toth, said Budapest’s appellate court had confirmed an earlier ruling to release the captain on a 15 million forint ($53,000) bail. Four more bodies – including those of the Mermaid’s captain and a six-year-old girl – were found as salvage crews slowly lifted the wreck from the riverbed on Tuesday. Four more people are still missing, presumed dead. The cruise liner’s owner, Swiss-based Viking Cruises Ltd , has said it is cooperating with Hungarian investigators.

"300"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-thousands-evacuated-as-cyclone-vayu-lashes-indias-western-coast-with/"|"Emily Schmall"|"Indian authorities evacuated tens of thousands of people on Wednesday as a severe cyclone in the Arabian Sea approached the western state of Gujarat, lashing the coast with high winds and heavy rainfall. Cyclone Vayu, named after the Hindi word for wind, was poised to glance the Gujarat coast Thursday afternoon as India’s second major storm of the season. Winds gusting up to 180 kilometres (112 miles) per hour were forecast and a storm surge up to 2 metres (6.5 feet) above astronomical tides, which would inundate low-lying areas, according to the India Meteorological Department. K. Sathi Devi, the New Delhi-based government scientist in charge of monitoring the cyclone, said a low pressure system over the ocean was causing water to “get piled up.” When the storm makes landfall, so will the accumulated sea water, she said, threatening to flood roads and uproot trees, contaminate drinking water supplies, and disrupt communications and power supplies. Vayu was forecast to skirt the coast as it travelled west toward Pakistan, retaining its intensity for as long as 12 hours as it straddled land and sea. “Very strong wind will likely remain for a longer period,” said R.K. Jenamani, another government scientist. “It’s a very unique kind of system.” In the ancient city of Dwarka, where many Hindu pilgrims travel every year to pray at a temple considered the centre of Lord Krishna’s kingdom, a rescue worker from India’s National Disaster Response Force warned children to leave the beach. After India’s home minister, Amit Shah, held a meeting Tuesday with government and military officials, the air force airlifted 40 National Disaster Response Force rescue and relief teams to the western coast. Both Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi hail from Gujarat. Modi said on Twitter that he had “been constantly in touch with state governments” and that he was “praying for the safety and wellbeing” of all those affected. By midday, rescue teams had begun evacuating more than a quarter of a million people in towns and villages likely to bear the brunt of the storm. The scale of the possible damage when Vayu makes landfall wasn’t immediately clear, but meteorologists predicted the destruction of thatched homes, flooding of escape routes and widespread damage to crops. They recommended that authorities focus evacuation efforts on residents of makeshift housing, from beachside huts to urban slums. Authorities appeared to have taken some cues from Cyclone Fani, which hit India’s eastern coast on the Bay of Bengal in May, killing 34 people in India and 15 in neighbouring Bangladesh. Authorities in the eastern state of Odisha, where Fani made landfall, were praised for precautionary measures – including evacuating more than a million people – that likely prevented a much higher death toll. In India’s financial capital of Mumbai, police tweeted that because of the high winds, heavy rainfall and lightning expected from Vayu, people “should not venture into sea and should keep safe distance from shoreline.” Gujarat’s chief minister, Vijay Rupani, requested on social media that tourists leave coastal areas by Wednesday afternoon.

"301"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-russian-police-drop-criminal-case-against-investigative-journalist/"|"Vladimir Soldatkin Andrew Osborn"|"Russian police abruptly dropped drugs charges on Tuesday against journalist Ivan Golunov, a rare U-turn by the authorities in the face of anger from his supporters who had alleged he was framed for his reporting and had threatened to stage a mass protest in Moscow. Mr. Golunov, a 36-year-old journalist known for exposing corruption among Moscow city officials, was detained by police last Thursday and accused of dealing drugs, an allegation he flatly denied. Russian journalists critical of authorities have led a dangerous existence since the 1990s – sometimes threatened, physically attacked, and even murdered for their work. But the crude way supporters said Mr. Golunov was set up and detained triggered an unusual show of media unity and an uncharacteristically swift response from authorities nervous about social unrest at a time when President Vladimir Putin already faces disquiet over living standards. Interior Minister Vladimir Kolokoltsev said the criminal case against Mr. Golunov was being dropped over a lack of evidence of any wrongdoing on his part. Mr. Golunov was freed from house arrest hours later. After having the electronic bracelet on his ankle removed, he walked out of a police station in central Moscow to be met by hundreds of journalists who applauded him. While welcoming Mr. Golunov’s release, a spokeswoman for the European Union on foreign affairs said the trend in Russia with regard to media freedom “remains worrying”. “Independent as well as critical voices are an essential part of any vibrant society,” Maja Kocijancic said on Twitter. Russia ranks 149th out of 180 countries worldwide on a media freedom index compiled by Reporters Without Borders, an advocacy group. Visibly emotional, Mr. Golunov thanked everyone for their support and said he would continue his work. “I will continue the work that I was doing and carry out investigations because I need to justify the trust in me that those who have supported me have shown,” he said. Choking back tears, he said he hoped other journalists would not have to undergo similar ordeals and that the investigation into the police officers and others who framed him would continue. Mr. Kolokoltsev, the interior minister, said some police officers involved in the case were being temporarily removed from duty pending an investigation and that he planned to ask Mr. Putin to dismiss other more senior police personnel. “I believe that the rights of every citizen, regardless of his profession, must be protected,” Mr. Kolokoltsev said. Galina Timchenko, general director of online news portal Meduza where Mr. Golunov works, and other senior Russian journalists said in a statement: “This was the result of an unprecedented international journalistic campaign and of citizens’ solidarity. We are glad that the authorities listened to society. That’s how it should be when an injustice occurs.” A team of investigative journalists would continue to try to establish who was behind his persecution, they added. Before the police backed down, nearly 25,000 people had signed up to a Facebook page expressing their intention to take part in a protest march on Wednesday in solidarity with Mr. Golunov. The authorities had said the protesters did not have approval, and that their protest could threaten public safety. The march presented the Kremlin with a quandary: either use force to break up the protest and risk provoking more anger, or stand aside and let the demonstration take place, which risked revealing weakness to the Kremlin’s opponents. The charges against Mr. Golunov inflamed opinion among urban professionals, a group that is in a minority countrywide, but which has outsize influence in Moscow. The three leading daily newspapers – Vedomosti, Kommersant and RBK – all carried the same headline on Monday in a rare show of solidarity: “I am/We are Ivan Golunov.” Journalists had protested outside Moscow’s police headquarters day after day demanding the case be dropped and celebrities and even some high-profile state TV anchors had spoken out in favour of Mr. Golunov. Mr. Golunov and Ms. Timchenko advised supporters against taking to the streets on Wednesday, saying it was better to hold a protest event at a later date.

"302"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-few-signs-of-diplomatic-progress-one-year-after-first-trump-kim-summit/"|"Josh Smith"|"A year after President Donald Trump and North Korea’s Kim Jong-un met for the first time, they appear committed to a personal bond upon which hopes for peace seem to rest despite a stalemate in efforts to get Kim to abandon his nuclear weapons. Trump and Kim agreed at the first U.S.-North Korea summit in Singapore to work toward the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, easing fears of war between their countries. But there has been little progress since then and tension has again been rising recently with North Korea resuming some limited testing of weapons and warning of “truly undesired consequences” if the United States was not more flexible. But Trump said on Tuesday he had received a “beautiful letter” from Kim. “I can’t show you the letter obviously, but it was a very personal, very warm, very nice letter,” Trump told reporters outside the White House. Trump, who has tried to convert what he feels is a warm personal relationship with Kim into a diplomatic breakthrough, gave no details, but repeated that he believed North Korea had “tremendous potential”. “I think that something will happen that’s going to be very positive,” he said. North Korea’s state media has not mentioned any letter. The optimism that the two leaders generated in Singapore all but evaporated in February when a second summit, in Vietnam, dramatically fell apart without even a recommitment to the general goals outlined in a statement signed in Singapore. Since then, North Korea has complained of U.S. sanctions and Kim said he would wait until the end of the year before deciding on whether to take a “new path”. Both sides have said they are open to talks but that the other side needs to change their policy. The United States says North Korea needs to make verifiable progress toward giving up its nuclear weapons before any sanctions are eased, while North Korea says the United States has done nothing to reward steps already taken. In the weeks ahead of Wednesday’s anniversary of the Singapore summit, North Korean state media has repeatedly warned that the statement signed there was in danger of being rendered meaningless if the United States did not drop demands for North Korea to unilaterally dismantle its nuclear arsenal. According to the Singapore foreign ministry, North Korea’s embassy there had been planning an event to commemorate the summit anniversary and invited Singapore officials. But it later cancelled the event. Still, North Korea has said it “remains unchanged in its stand and will to cherish and implement in good faith” the Singapore statement, which included vague promises to improve relations and eventually pursue the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. A third summit between Trump and Kim was possible but the ball was in Pyongyang’s court, White House national security adviser John Bolton said on Tuesday. Bolton said the United States was continuing its “maximum pressure campaign” because Kim still appeared not to have made “a strategic decision to give up the pursuit of deliverable nuclear weapons.” South Korean President Moon Jae-in said in a speech in Norway the talks appeared to be in a stalemate but the United States and North Korea needed more time to understand each other. “It is the process of thawing out hostile feelings that have persisted for the last 70 years,” Moon said. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said on Monday North Korea is “one of the toughest national security challenges”. “There’s always ups and downs, and we remain confident that Kim Jong-un and his government will see a path for a brighter future for the North Korean people,” she told reporters. “And one year later, that’s what we are still aspiring to and still hoping for while noting, of course, that economic sanctions do remain.” Those sanctions remain a key sticking point, with North Korea calling them illegal after the United States announced it had seized a North Korean cargo ship accused of illicit coal shipments in violation of sanctions. The United States is also keen to secure more sanctions enforcement by China. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said that while negotiations had slowed, North Korea still wanted a denuclearized Korean peninsula and both it and the United States were committed to resolving their issues via talks. “It is an intricate and complex problem and cannot be solved overnight,” Geng told reporters. In May, Kim oversaw the test launch of new, short-range missiles while giving a cold shoulder to projects planned with South Korea. The North’s leader has maintained his efforts to build diplomatic ties with other countries, meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin in April. Kim sent Putin a congratulatory message on Wednesday saying he believed that “the common understanding and agreements made at our first significant meeting will bear rich fruits”.

The Ugandan cases show the epidemic is entering a “truly frightening” phase and could kill many more people, one infectious disease specialist told Reuters. A five-year-old boy who had crossed into Uganda from Congo died late on Tuesday, said Uganda’s health minister, Jane Ruth Aceng, and his family were now being monitored in isolation. The two new victims were the boy’s brother and grandmother, the Ugandan Health Ministry said. His grandfather had recently died of Ebola. Uganda plans to repatriate the two patients with Ebola to Congo, saying they can get better treatment in specialized facilities there. Three more family members, who are so far healthy, will also be repatriated, a health ministry spokesman said. The family must consent to all repatriations, he said. “This epidemic is in a truly frightening phase and shows no sign of stopping,” said Jeremy Farrar, an infectious disease specialist and director of the Wellcome Trust global health charity, which is involved in fighting Ebola. “We can expect and should plan for more cases in DRC and neighbouring countries,” he said, adding: “There are now more deaths than any other Ebola outbreak in history, bar the West Africa epidemic of 2013-16, and there can be no doubt that the situation could escalate towards those terrible levels.” The current Ebola epidemic began in August last year in eastern Congo and has already infected at least 2,062 people, killing 1,390 of them. The West Africa epidemic infected 28,000 people and killed 11,300, mostly in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. The viral disease spreads through contact with bodily fluids, causing hemorrhagic fever with severe vomiting, diarrhea and bleeding. World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus will reconvene an emergency committee on Friday to decide whether the outbreak is an international public health emergency and how to manage it, a WHO statement said. Authorities have struggled to contain the disease partly because health workers have been repeatedly attacked in conflict-ravaged eastern Congo, the epicentre of the outbreak. This year, the WHO has documented 174 attacks on health care workers and facilities in Congo, causing 5 deaths and 51 injuries of health care workers and patients, Geneva-based spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told Reuters on Wednesday. There is widespread public mistrust of the Congo government and health workers from outside the region, giving rise to rumours that the disease is a ruse to try to rig elections in the area, where dozens of armed groups operate. Other rumours accuse health teams of spreading the disease. Many victims have sought treatment with traditional healers instead. Uganda, which has been on high alert for a possible spread of Ebola and has already vaccinated many frontline health workers, is relatively well prepared to contain the virus. WHO is bringing in 3,500 additional vaccines and will begin vaccinating more people on Friday. “The current cases in Uganda will be quickly contained but the failure to stop the current Ebola epidemic in DRC is simply tragic,” said Ian Jones, a professor virology at Britain’s Reading University. Eastern Congo also borders South Sudan, which is struggling to emerge from five years of devastating civil war and whose health facilities are basic even in the capital. “We are deeply concerned for countries such as South Sudan that do not have the infrastructure to handle an outbreak,” Whitney Elmer, Congo country director at aid group Mercy Corps.

"304"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-sara-netanyahu-wife-of-israels-pm-accepts-plea-deal-in-case-of/"|"Isabel Debre"|"Sara Netanyahu, wife of the Israeli prime minister, struck a guilty plea bargain Wednesday settling allegations that she overspent some $100,000 of state money on lavish meals, state prosecutors said. Mrs. Netanyahu will pay around $15,000 in fines to quietly close the case, which accused her of running up large tabs at luxury restaurants for friends and family while the official prime minister’s residence employed a full-time chef. Last year, Mrs. Netanyahu, 60, was indicted on charges of fraud and breach of trust. According to the indictment, she strove “to circumvent the rules and conditions governing the prime minister’s official residence in order to fraudulently obtain state funding for various expenses” from the years 2010 to 2013. The plea deal, which was finalized in a Jerusalem court Wednesday, saw Mrs. Netanyahu admit to a more minor charge of “intentionally exploiting the mistake of someone else,” specifically by misleading officials who didn’t realize she already benefited from chefs on the government payroll. Under the terms of the bargain, Mrs. Netanyahu agreed to pay $2,800 in fines and hand the remaining $12,500 back to the state. The settlement also reduced the overspending at stake to around $50,000. The family lawyer confirmed the deal’s details but declined comment. The State Attorney’s office justified its leniency in a statement, saying Mrs. Netanyahu deserves credit for confessing to a criminal offence that she had consistently denied. Mrs. Netanyahu has long come under fire for extravagant spending and abusive behaviour. In 2016, a court ruled she mistreated a housecleaner and awarded the man $42,000 in damages. Other employees have accused her of abuse, charges the Netanyahus reject. Former housekeeper Shira Raban is currently suing Mrs. Netanyahu for $63,000 in damages over mistreatment and harassment, her lawyer said. She made her first court appearance Tuesday in Jerusalem. But the prime minister himself remains the real focus of the family’s repeated legal troubles. Netanyahu is facing an indictment on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust, pending a hearing now scheduled for early October. He has pushed for a postponement, and can still request an extension from the Supreme Court. The prime minister is accused of accepting lavish gifts from billionaire friends, and promising to promote advantageous legislation for a major newspaper in exchange for favourable coverage. He vehemently denies wrongdoing, portraying himself as a victim of a media-orchestrated witch hunt aimed at ousting him.

"305"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-japans-abe-warns-an-accidental-conflict-could-be-sparked-amid/"|"Amir Vahdat Aya Batrawy Jon Gambrell"|"Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe travelled to Tehran on Wednesday to warn that an “accidental conflict” could be sparked amid heightened tensions between Iran and the U.S., a message that came hours after Yemen’s Iranian-backed Houthi rebels attacked a Saudi airport, wounding 26 people. Abe’s trip is the highest-level effort yet to de-escalate the crisis as Tehran appears poised to break the 2015 nuclear deal it struck with world powers, an accord that the Trump administration pulled out of last year. It’s also the first visit of a sitting Japanese premier in the 40 years since the Islamic Revolution. But success may prove difficult for Abe, as the Houthi rebel attack on Saudi Arabia’s Abha regional airport underscored. The attack is just the latest in a wave of rebel drone and missile attacks targeting the kingdom, which has been mired in a year-long war in Yemen that has killed an estimated 60,000 people and pushed the Arab world’s poorest nation to the brink of famine. Iran is threatening to resume enriching uranium closer to weapons-grade level on July 7 if European allies fail to offer it new terms. While President Donald Trump says he wants to talk to Tehran, the U.S. has piled on sanctions that have seen Iran’s rial currency plummet along with its crucial oil exports. The U.S. also has sent an aircraft carrier and B-52 bombers to the region, along with hundreds more troops to back up the tens of thousands already deployed across the Middle East. The U.S. blames Iran for the Houthi assaults, as well as a mysterious attack on oil tankers off the coast of the United Arab Emirates. Abe called for “more patience” on all sides in the crisis, which he warned could spiral out of control. “At the moment tension is rising. We should do anything we can to prevent an accidental conflict from happening and Iran should play its constructive role,” Abe said in an address to journalists after talks with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. “There is possibility of an accidental conflict and a military conflict should be prevented at all costs.” Rouhani for his part iterated a warning that Iran would offer a “crushing” response if attacked by the U.S. He also claimed that Japan wanted to again buy Iranian crude oil, something it had stopped under threat of U.S. sanctions. Abe did not acknowledge expressing that in their talks. “Whenever the economic war stops, we will see a very positive development in the region and the world,” Rouhani said. Neither leader took questions from journalists. Abe’s plane landed at Tehran’s Mehrabad International Airport on Wednesday afternoon where he was greeted by Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. He immediately met Rouhani at the Sadabad Palace in northern Tehran, where soldiers on horseback bearing the Iranian and Japanese flags accompanied his car. Abe will see Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khameini on Thursday. The Japanese premier was seen as an interlocutor for Trump. Abe had just invited the American president to Japan last month and is in the process of negotiating with him over economic issues as well. Middle East peace is a must for Japan, which gets most of the oil fuelling its economy from there. Recent threats from Iran to close off the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth through which a third of all oil traded by sea passes, have raised concerns. The looming threats to regional security could be seen just hours earlier in the attack on Abha. The Houthis said they launched a cruise missile at the Saudi airport while the kingdom said 26 people were hurt. At least one Yemeni and one Indian national were among those injured in the attack, which al-Turki said struck the airport’s arrivals hall between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. State television later showed pictures of damage to a roof and debris on the airport’s tarmac, though it made a point to also show live footage from the airport of passengers queuing up to catch flights. Though there were no fatalities, it was the largest number of civilians to be wounded in Saudi Arabia as a result of an attack by the rebels since the start of the Saudi-led war in Yemen more than four years ago. The Houthis have previously used ballistic missiles to target the Saudi capital, Riyadh, and the airport there. More recently, they have launched bomb-laden drones targeting a key oil pipeline and the southwest city of Khamis Mushait. A Houthi spokesman, Mohammed Abdel-Salam, said Wednesday’s attack was in response to Saudi Arabia’s “continued aggression and blockade on Yemen.” Iran’s nuclear deal, reached in 2015 by China, Russia, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the U.S., saw Tehran agree to limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of crippling sanctions. Western powers feared Iran’s atomic program could allow it to build nuclear weapons, although Iran long has insisted its program was for peaceful purposes. In withdrawing from the deal last year, Trump pointed to the accord not limiting Iran’s ballistic missile program and not addressing what American officials describe as Tehran’s malign influence across the wider Middle East. Those who struck the deal at the time described it as a building block toward further negotiations with Iran, whose Islamic government has had a tense relationship with America since the 1979 takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and subsequent hostage crisis. Already, Iran says it quadrupled its production of low-enriched uranium. Meanwhile, U.S. sanctions have cut off opportunities for Iran to trade its excess uranium and heavy water abroad, putting Tehran on course to violate terms of the nuclear deal regardless.

"306"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-malis-government-lowers-estimate-of-death-toll-from-village-raid-to/"|""|"Mali’s government has more than halved its estimate of the death toll from an attack this week on a Dogon village, even as local leaders insisted that close to 100 were killed in the latest wave of ethnic violence. Attackers believed to belong to the Fulani ethnic group raided the rival Dogon village of Sobane Da, in Mali’s central Mopti region, between Sunday and Monday, torching homes and shooting people in the back. The government said on Wednesday the death toll of 95 first reported by the village chief had mistakenly combined the numbers of dead and of people missing. “The number of people killed has been taken back from 95 to 35, including 11 adults and 24 children,” it said in a statement broadcast on state radio. But Ali Dolo, mayor of the district in which Sunday’s attack took place, told Reuters the revised death toll did not take account of charred body parts that had yet to be identified. “He has his toll, we have ours,” Dolo said on Tuesday, in response to a regional official who had previously challenged the 95 figure. Malians have grown increasingly frustrated by failures of the government of President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita to protect them from both jihadist onslaughts and ethnic reprisals. Mali, a former French colony, has been in turmoil since Tuareg rebels and loosely allied Islamists took over its north in 2012. French forces intervened in 2013 to push back the jihadist advance but the militants have since regrouped, tapping into ethnic rivalries to recruit new members and launching attacks across the region. Violence between Dogon hunters and Fulani herders has killed scores since January. An attack in March killed more than 150 Fulani, one of the worst acts of bloodshed in Mali’s recent history. It forced the resignation of the then-prime minister and government. In its latest statement, the government said six people had been detained in relation to the Sobame Da killings. Unrest flared again on Wednesday, when gunmen attacked two Dogon villages in the district of Bankass, less than 50 km away from Sobame Da. “Unidentified armed men on motorcycles are surrounding the village and firing at people,” Bankass mayor Moulaye Guindo said via telephone, describing the attacks as ongoing. Guindo said people wounded in the attack had been taken to a local hospital, but had no information on the number of casualties. Years of fighting and military presence have taken a toll on civilians. Three people were killed last week in the western region of Timbuktu, known for harbouring Islamist militants, after French troops fired warning shots at a suspect vehicle. “This shot unintentionally caused the vehicle to explode,” the army said in a statement on Wednesday, adding that the vehicle had been loaded with large quantities of petrol.

"307"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-kosovo-albanians-welcome-clinton-albright-20-years-after-nato-2/"|"Fatos Bytyci"|"Thousands of Kosovo Albanians turned out on Wednesday to welcome back former U.S. president Bill Clinton and his ex-top diplomat Madeleine Albright 20 years after they helped engineer the NATO air war that ousted Serbian forces. Clinton, 72, and Albright, 82, were greeted like rock stars in the Kosovo capital Pristina where a statue of Albright was unveiled in the city centre for the occasion, joining one of Clinton erected earlier on a boulevard named after him. Majority-Albanian Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, nine years after NATO air strikes ended Belgrade’s repressive grip on the territory following a brutal counter-insurgency campaign by Serbian security forces. “I love this country and it will always be one of the greatest honours of my life to have stood with you against ethnic cleansing (by Serbian forces) and for freedom,” Clinton told thousands gathered in sweltering heat in downtown Pristina. Marking the 20th anniversary of NATO peacekeeping troops entering Kosovo after Serbian forces left, Kosovo President Hashim Thaci awarded Clinton and Albright medals of freedom “for the liberty he brought to us and the peace to entire region.” Clinton and Albright were the most outspoken proponents of NATO intervention to halt killings of Kosovar civilians by Serbian forces as part of Belgrade’s 1998-99 crackdown on a Kosovo Albanian guerrilla uprising. “I was watching the NATO planes from the window of my apartment in Pristina during the war and I was praying to God and the USA; I had no other hope,” said Gani Kelmendi, 78, as he waited in the crowd for Clinton to appear. “I remember the moment when in my village the Serb army was getting out and French soldiers were coming in. I could not believe my eyes,” said Fetah Berisha, 67, who considers Clinton Kosovo’s “saviour”. But the end of fighting brought about by NATO’s intervention has not brought true peace to the southern Balkan region. Belgrade has still not recognized independent Kosovo more than a decade after more than 110 other countries did and, backed by its main ally Russia, is blocking Pristina’s bid for membership of the United Nations. Tensions rose anew six months ago when Kosovo introduced a 100 per cent tax on goods imported from Serbia and warned it would keep them until Belgrade recognized its independence. The European Union has warned Kosovo and Serbia that they will not advance toward wished-for membership unless they reach an agreement to normalize relations.

"308"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-russian-police-detain-more-than-400-people-at-protest-over-journalist/"|"Jim Heintz"|"Hundreds of people were detained Wednesday as they marched in the Russian capital to protest what they called police fabrications in the wake of the arrest of an investigative journalist on drug charges that later were dropped when the government admitted there was no evidence he committed a crime. The mass arrests at the unauthorized rally provided a harsh coda to the elation of journalists and other supporters of Ivan Golunov a day after Russia’s interior minister announced the unprecedented move to drop the charges and seek punishment for the police officers involved. “We should not stand down, even if Ivan is free. There are a number of other people in his situation in this country,” said Maxim Reznik, a member of the St. Petersburg City Council who attended a smaller demonstration in that city. Police said more than 200 were detained in the Moscow demonstration, but the OVD-Info organization that monitors political arrests put the figure at more than 400. The Interior Ministry said about 1,200 people took part in the Moscow demonstration, and those arrested faced charges that could bring up to 20 days in jail, state news agency Tass reported. Among them was Alexei Navalny, President Vladimir Putin’s most prominent foe. Mr. Golunov, a reporter for the website Meduza, was arrested June 6 for allegedly dealing synthetic stimulants. Many believed he was set up as retaliation for his reporting on Moscow City Hall and the city’s crime-ridden funeral industry. Information quickly surfaced indicating Moscow police acted based on falsified evidence and sham allegations. In announcing Mr. Golunov’s arrest, police posted photos of drugs allegedly taken in the journalist’s apartment, but then admitted the images came from another case. Defence lawyers said his fingerprints weren’t on any of the drug packets allegedly found in his apartment. An outcry over his arrest intensified quickly, apparently catching authorities by surprise. Objections to Mr. Golunov’s treatment were reported in unusual detail by Russian state media that generally hew closely to official versions. Three of Russia’s most respected newspapers published near-identical front pages Monday reading “I/we am/are Ivan Golunov.” Even the powerful speaker of Russia’s upper house of Parliament expressed concern about the case. Russian human-rights activists have often complained to little effect of fabricated criminal cases against opposition figures and those who raise inconvenient questions about sometimes-shady businesses. While the unusual prominence of Mr. Golunov’s case could be seen as a watershed in drawing attention to the issue, observers also said it was only the beginning of a long struggle to hold authorities accountable. “The case against Golunov is actually over. But the case against the system in which such lawlessness became possible is just beginning,” Maria Zheleznova, opinion editor of the newspaper Vedomosti, wrote in a piece published Wednesday. However, the police action at the Moscow demonstration showed that authorities intend to keep tight control over public protest. Opposition groups are routinely denied permission to hold rallies or sometimes given permission for gatherings at undesirable times or low-visibility locations. Authorities had said the pro-Golunov demonstrators could hold a rally on Sunday, but protesters believed a delay could have sapped a sense of momentum.

"309"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-trump-commits-additional-1000-troops-to-ally-poland/"|"Darlene Superville"|"The United States will send 1,000 more troops to Poland as part of a growing security and economic partnership between the two countries, President Donald Trump said Wednesday. He and Polish President Andrzej Duda differed over Russia’s intentions toward the U.S. ally. At a time of ongoing worries about Russian military activity, Duda said he wanted Russia to be a friend of Poland even as he recounted his country’s long history of conflict with Moscow. “We would like Russia to be our friend, but unfortunately, Russia again is showing its very unkind, unpleasant imperial face,” Duda said, noting its attacks on Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014. He spoke through a translator during a news conference with Trump in the White House Rose Garden, where they discussed details of the military deal. Trump, who has a history of appearing to defer to Russia, seemed to downplay Duda’s concerns. “I hope that Poland is going to have a great relationship with Russia. I think it’s possible. I really do,” Trump said. “I think because of what you’ve done, and the strength, and maybe we help also, because of what we’re doing and doing for Poland. “But I hope Poland is going to have a great relationship with Russia. I hope we’re going to have a great relationship with Russia, and by the way, China and many other countries,” he said. Trump said he likely will make his second visit to Poland as president in September, the 80th anniversary of the invasion by Nazi Germany in 1939 that set off World War II. And he said he was thinking about allowing Poland to participate in a State Department program that allows its citizens to visit the U.S. for tourism or business without obtaining a visa, but that more progress was needed before a final decision. Polish leaders had hoped to land a permanent U.S. base in their country that they said could be called “Fort Trump,” but the agreement announced Wednesday fell short of that. It includes just the addition of about 1,000 troops and a squadron of Reaper drones for intelligence purposes. Trump said the Polish government will pay for the infrastructure to support the troops. The service members will be added to an existing force of about 4,500 U.S. troops that rotate in and out of Poland. Trump said he probably would shift some U.S. service members from Germany, where tens of thousands have been based for a “long, long time,” or from elsewhere in Europe. He offered no timetable for when the additional military personnel would begin arriving in Poland. Trump also hailed Poland’s decision to buy more than 30 F-35 joint strike fighter jets from the U.S. In recognition of that purchase, a single F-35 made two passes over the White House on a sunny afternoon as Trump, Duda and their wives watched from the lawn. Duda looked up and waved at the passing jet. Duda also invoked Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan as he thanked the president for his interest in Poland. In the Oval Office, Trump said he had no concerns about backsliding on democracy in Poland. Duda denied there were problems, saying “everything is excellent.” Critics have accused the Polish government of taking steps to undermine the judiciary and the news media. Trump’s decision to increase the U.S. military presence in Poland was welcomed by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. “This shows the strong commitment of the US to European security & the strength of the transatlantic bond,” he said in a tweet. The U.S. resumed increasing its military activity in Europe in concert with NATO allies following Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014. That includes stationing four multinational battalion-size battlegroups in alliance members Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, led respectively by the U.S., Britain, Canada and Germany. The Eastern European nations have reached out to the U.S. and NATO for greater protection, fearing becoming the next target of Russia’s military advance. The increase in U.S. forces in the region also reflects America’s new national defence strategy that declares great-power competition with China and Russia as a top priority.

"310"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-boris-johnson-kicks-off-bid-to-succeed-britains-theresa-may-with-oct/"|"Elizabeth Piper William James"|"Boris Johnson kicked off his campaign to succeed Prime Minister Theresa May on Wednesday with a commitment to lead Britain out of the European Union on Oct. 31, warning his divided Conservative Party “delay means defeat”. Johnson, favourite for the top job nearly three years since he led the referendum campaign to leave the EU, praised the strength of the British economy and promised to tackle widespread disillusionment over the protracted Brexit process. To a packed room where some supportive lawmakers were forced to stand, Johnson drew on his past as a former London mayor to try to persuade Conservatives that only he could take the party to election victory, explaining away some of his well-documented gaffes as his desire to “speak as directly as I can”. “After three years and two missed deadlines, we must leave the EU on October 31,” he said as a heckler repeatedly yelled “Bollocks to Boris” from outside the Royal Academy of Engineering, just off The Mall in central London. “I am not aiming for a no-deal outcome,” said Johnson, a 54-year-old former foreign minister. “I don’t think that we will end up with any such thing, but it is only responsible to prepare vigorously and seriously for no-deal. Indeed it is astonishing that anyone could suggest dispensing with that vital tool in the negotiation.” Johnson is one of 10 contenders to replace May, whose premiership crumbled after she repeatedly failed to convince parliament to ratify the divorce deal she negotiated in November with the EU. After Johnson was widely praised by supporters, one rival, Rory Stewart, said Johnson could be his own worst enemy during a campaign that will run until late July. “On reflection I am beginning to think there are only two candidates who can beat Boris – me, and Boris himself,” he said on Twitter. Johnson, whose unconventional style has helped him shrug off a series of scandals in the past, has won over much of his party by arguing that only he can rescue the Conservatives by delivering Brexit. For many, the contest for prime minister is his to lose – he has the most declared Conservative supporters in parliament and is widely popular among the party’s members, the people who will ultimately choose May’s successor. In a room full of Conservatives loyal to his campaign who groaned when journalists brought up lists of past indiscretions, including a report he had taken cocaine, Johnson repeatedly sidestepped questions, using his trademark colourful metaphors and language to change the subject. Asked if he could be trusted, Johnson said he could. On drugs, which has become a campaign issue after rival, Michael Gove was forced to admit he had taken cocaine 20 years ago when he was a journalist, Johnson said: “I think what most people want us to focus on in this campaign, if I may say so, is what we can do for them and what our plans are for this great country of ours.” As in the 2016 referendum on EU membership, Johnson’s message is clear: any more Brexit delays and the Conservative Party risks opening the door to a government led by opposition Labour leader and veteran socialist Jeremy Corbyn. “We will simply not get a result if we give the impression that we want to go on kicking the can down the road and yet more delay,” Johnson said. “Delay means defeat, delay means Corbyn.” Interior minister Sajid Javid agreed that voters felt the government was incompetent because of the failure to deliver Brexit but had a jibe at his rival as he launched his own leadership campaign “I am the change candidate, Boris Johnson is yesterday’s news,” Javid said. “He has been around in politics for a while, he has achieved a lot, he has still got a big role to play, but I think if we are trying to connect with the next generation and move forward as a country, then I think it is time for the next generation with a bold new agenda.” The United Kingdom could be heading toward a constitutional crisis over Brexit as many of the candidates vying to succeed May are prepared to leave the EU on Oct. 31 without a deal, something parliament has indicated it would stop. However, lawmakers on Wednesday defeated a cross-party attempt led by the main Labour opposition to try to block a no-deal exit by seizing control of the parliamentary agenda from the government, prompting sterling to fall to a day’s low against the dollar. The EU has also refused to renegotiate the Withdrawal Agreement reached with May last November, and Ireland has indicated it is not willing to change the Irish border “backstop” that upset the Northern Irish party which props up May’s minority government. Johnson made his name as an EU-bashing journalist in Brussels before entering politics – and upset some Europeans before Britain’s Brexit referendum by comparing the EU’s goals with those of Hitler and Napoleon. “Occasionally some plaster comes off the ceiling as a result of a phrase I may have used, or indeed as a result of how that phrase has been wrenched out of context and interpreted by those who wish for reasons of their own to caricature my views,” he said on Wednesday. “But I think it is vital that we as politicians remember that one of the reasons why the public feels alienated now from us all as a breed – politicians – is because too often they feel we are muffling and veiling our language, not speaking as we find, covering everything up in bureaucratic platitudes, when what they want to hear is what we genuinely think.” "|"Boris Johnson kicks off bid to succeed Britain’s Theresa May with Oct. 31 Brexit pledge"|"2019-06-12T08:24:09-0400"|"Boris Johnson,Brexit,Brexit deal,EU,Theresa May,Britain,Conservative leadership,news,world,johnson,boris,campaign,party,result,Johnson", 
"311"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-cyclone-vayu-batters-fishing-hub-but-veers-away-from-indias-western/"|"Ajit Solanki"|"A cyclone in the Arabian Sea battered an Indian fishing hub with heavy wind, waves and rain Thursday and was forecast to bring dangerous weather conditions even as it veered away from the subcontinent’s western coast. The India Meteorological Department said Cyclone Vayu, named after the Hindi word for wind and the season’s second major storm, was moving parallel to the coast of the western state of Gujarat, unlikely to hit it head on as previously forecast but instead turn toward the centre of the sea. Pakistan warned of rough seas and dangerous heat, though the cyclone wasn’t expected to directly hit the port city of Karachi. In anticipation of the storm, rescue workers evacuated nearly 300,000 people, taking a cue from Cyclone Fani, which came ashore on India’s eastern coast in May, killing 34 people in India and 15 in neighbouring Bangladesh. An unprecedented evacuation effort that involved relocating about a million people ahead of Fani was credited with saving many lives. Though not as severe as Fani and unlikely to make landfall, Indian authorities cautioned that Vayu could leave dangerous conditions in its wake. Evacuation efforts continued Thursday. “We have alerted people from 70 villages and are trying to tell others to evacuate as well. There is a chance that the storm will pick up pace and become stronger now,” Gujarat state minister Jawaharbhai Chavda said. In Veraval, a hub of India’s fishing industry, heavy wind and rain from Vayu battered the beaches. Fishing boats were splintered by huge waves crashing onto shore. Local police were making a last-minute appeal to hut dwellers to leave their homes. A blanket of steady rain came down in the coastal city of Porbandar, the birthplace of Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi. Though 100 kilometres (62 miles) offshore, Vayu was whipping Porbander with winds up to 60 kilometres (37 miles) per hour. Pilgrims entered a seaside Hindu temple undeterred by waves crashing against the exterior in the coastal city of Dwarka, which Hindus believe is the centre of Lord Krishna’s kingdom. With the worst averted, rescue workers, including 50 teams from the National Disaster Relief Force and around 1,000 Indian navy and army personnel, were searching for any villagers who remained in coastal areas to urge them to relocate to school buildings and other designated evacuation sites. People were piled into flatbed trucks and buses and driven away from the shore. “We expect the high winds to remain until tomorrow morning and some disturbances to remain until around Saturday or Sunday,” said Hemendra Khatma, assistant force commander. Khatma said no deaths or injuries had been reported. Pakistan’s meteorological department warned fishermen to stay on land this week as the cyclone could cause rough sea conditions. The cyclone was not likely to directly impact the southern port city of Karachi, but the department said the weather system could cause dust storms and rain in various parts of the southern Sindh province. It said a heat wave was likely to hit Karachi on Thursday and Friday because the cyclone could stifle sea breezes, with temperatures rising to 42 degrees Celsius (108 degrees Fahrenheit). The meteorological department also asked authorities to remain alert through Saturday, even if Cyclone Vayu remained far away from the country’s coastal areas.

"312"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-g20-to-tackle-ocean-plastic-waste-as-petrochemical-producers-expand-in-4/"|"Malcolm Foster"|"Japan wants to make reducing the glut of plastic waste in the oceans a priority at the Group of 20 summit it is hosting this month as governments around the world crack down on such pollution. Images of plastic debris-strewn beaches and dead animals with stomachs full of plastic have sparked outrage, with many countries, including more than two dozen in Africa, banning plastic bags outright. The EU has voted to outlaw 10 single-use plastic items, including straws, forks and knives, by 2021. It has also set targets for all plastic packaging, the top source of plastic waste, to be recyclable by 2030. Such moves are setting up a showdown with the oil industry, which is pouring billions into new facilities to produce more plastic and other petrochemical products, particularly in Asia. Refiners such as India’s Reliance Industries and China’s Sinopec are seeking new revenue sources as electric cars become more popular and gasoline and diesel demand slows. “If the world goes the direction of European targets, some markets can go from high growth to low growth or no growth. Profits could suffer,” said Jeff Brown, president of energy consultancy FGE in Singapore. Tackling plastic pollution has been less of a priority in Asia, which is the world’s biggest producer of the material – and its waste. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, which is hosting the G20 summit, says he wants his country to lead the world in reducing marine plastic trash, including developing biodegradables and other innovations. The June 28-29 meeting in Osaka, assembling 20 major economies, including China, Brazil, France and the United States, won’t yield an agreement on targets or concrete steps, two officials involved in preparations told Reuters, speaking anonymously because they were not authorized to speak to the media. A more likely outcome is for G20 environment ministers, gathering this weekend in the mountain town of Karuizawa, to propose ways to enact a vaguely worded “action plan” on marine plastic waste introduced at the 2017 summit in Germany. Japan, while not a major marine plastic polluter, is the world’s No. 2 consumer of plastic packaging per person after the United States. Vegetables and fruit sold in supermarkets in Japan are commonly wrapped in plastic, sometimes individually. The cultural emphasis on hygiene, careful packaging and offering products in small portions adds to the problem. Japanese bureaucrats are working on a law that would require retailers to charge customers for plastic bags – something many supermarkets already do. Japan also plans to make the medal podiums at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics out of recycled plastic in an attempt to stir consumer awareness about the issue. Activists say that although efforts to recycle and ban single-use items are needed, reducing plastic production is also crucial. “There’s a misconception that we can recycle our way out of this,” said Neil Tangri, global plastics policy adviser at the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives in Berkeley, California. “My fear is that (G20 leaders) will say that plastic production isn’t the problem, it’s waste management,” he added. “We’re saying plastic is a problem you need to tackle at the source.” The world produced about 380 million metric tons of plastic in 2015, according to research published in Science Advances journal. The World Bank says humans generated 242 million tons of plastic waste in 2016. About 55 per cent of plastic waste was discarded in 2015, 25 per cent incinerated and 20 per cent recycled. But since plastic was introduced into the consumer market in the 1950s, only 9 per cent of the cumulative total has been recycled, the Science Advances study shows. Tackling plastic pollution became more of a global priority after China, which had been accepting a hefty chunk of the world’s waste, banned imports at the start of 2018. Boatloads of plastic debris have been diverted to Malaysia and other Southeast Asian nations, overwhelming them. Last month, Malaysia said it would ship 3,000 tons of garbage back to the countries it came from. Asia is also home to the biggest contributors to the estimated 8 million metric tons of plastic trash that winds up in the ocean each year, according to research published in the journal Science. The top five marine plastic trash offenders are all in Asia: China and Indonesia – both G-20 members – followed by the Philippines, Vietnam and Sri Lanka, that study shows. Such litter inflicts $1.3-billion in damage annually to fishing, shipping and tourism industries in the Asia-Pacific. Most commonly used plastic does not biodegrade. Over time in the ocean and exposed to sunlight, it breaks down into tiny pieces called microplastics that are ingested by sea creatures, raising concerns about chemicals tainting human sources of food. Plastic was even found last month at the bottom of the Marianas Trench, off the Philippines, the deepest place on Earth. Plastic output seems poised to increase, particularly in Asia. The region’s leading oil companies, including Sinopec, Reliance, Malaysia’s Petronas and China’s Hengli Petrochemical, are investing billions of dollars into new petrochemical facilities. They see opportunities in producing household chemicals and materials for electronic goods, piping, packaging and textiles. Packaging, which includes everything from plastic bags to bubble wrap, accounts for 44 per cent of plastic production, according to industry estimates. Tightening government policies could crimp that demand – something oil companies say they are monitoring closely. “If the world keeps introducing bans on plastic bags and straws, our sales would decrease,” said an official at a South Korean petrochemical maker, who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media. “But plastic is still widely used in the industrial sector … and demand from developing countries is growing,” he said. “In the long term, we are looking to develop environmentally friendly materials and plastics.” Japan’s petrochemical industry wants to co-operate in tackling environmental issues, Takashi Tsukioka, the head of the Petroleum Association of Japan, told a news conference last month. Still, he warned that replacing plastic straws with wooden ones could lead to deforestation. “We should, in the first place, focus on separating and recycling, which Japan has been doing, and then seek broad solutions, instead of jumping quickly to one approach,” he said. “In the end, we should promote innovation.” Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day’s most important headlines.

Critics say the measure, now on hold, would undermine the city’s cherished legal autonomy amid moves by Beijing to tighten its hold over the former British colony. Police said they arrested 11 people on charges such as assaulting police officers and unlawful assembly. Police Commissioner Stephen Lo Wai-chung said 22 officers had been injured. Hospital officials said they treated 81 people for protest-related injuries. Several hundred young protesters gathered Thursday on a pedestrian bridge, standing for hours and singing “Sing Hallelujah to the Lord,” and holding up signs with messages such as, “Don’t Shoot” and “End the Violence.” The debris-strewn area around the city’s government headquarters, which was besieged by the demonstrators a day earlier, was blocked off by police. The standoff between police and protesters is Hong Kong’s most severe political crisis since the Communist Party-ruled mainland took control in 1997 with a promise not to interfere with the city’s civil liberties and courts. It poses a profound challenge both to the local leadership and to Chinese President Xi Jinping, the country’s strongest leader in decades who has demanded that Hong Kong follow Beijing’s dictates. Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam declared that Wednesday’s violence was “rioting” that was “intolerable in any civilized society that respects the rule of law.” That designation could raise potential legal penalties for those arrested for taking part. “Intense confrontation is surely not the solution to ease disputes and resolve controversies,” Lam said, according to an official news release. A group of opposition lawmakers attempted to visit Lam’s residence to protest against the police use of force, including tear gas and rubber bullets, against the protesters on Wednesday. They were stopped by police and it was unclear if they would be able to present their complaint. It’s also unclear how Lam, as chief executive, might defuse the crisis, given Beijing’s strong support for the extradition bill and its distaste for dissent. Beijing has condemned the protests but so far has not indicated whether it is planning harsher measures. In past cases of unrest, the authorities have waited months or years before rounding up protest leaders. Nearly two years ago, Xi issued a stern address in the city stating that Beijing would not tolerate Hong Kong becoming a base for what the Communist Party considers a foreign-inspired campaign to undermine its rule over the vast nation of 1.4 billion people. Not all in Hong Kong support the protesters. About a dozen older people staged a demonstration in a downtown garden in support of the extradition bill. But others expressed sympathy. “I think that if the government continues doing this, there will be no hope for Hong Kong. If there’s no hope for Hong Kong, this is the last chance for us to fight for (it),” said Daniel Lee, a doctor. “But I don’t know if we can do anything meaningful. Seeing these kids going out, being hit like this and suffering tear gas, anyone with some sense of justice will come to help them.” Though never a bastion of democracy, Hong Kong enjoys freedoms of speech and protest denied to Chinese living in the mainland. Opposition to the proposed extradition legislation, championed by Lam with Beijing’s support, brought what organizers said was 1 million people into the streets on Sunday. The clashes Wednesday drew tens of thousands of mostly young residents and forced the legislature to postpone debate on the bill. On June 4, the city saw one of its biggest candlelight vigils in recent years to commemorate the 30th anniversary of China’s bloody suppression of student-led pro-democracy protests centred on Beijing’s Tiananmen Square in 1989. Those in Hong Kong who anger China’s central government have come under greater pressure since Xi came to power in 2012. The detention of several Hong Kong booksellers in late 2015 intensified worries about the erosion of the territory’s rule of law. The booksellers vanished before resurfacing in police custody in mainland China. Among them, Swedish citizen Gui Minhai is under investigation for allegedly leaking state secrets after he sold gossipy books about Chinese leaders. In April, nine leaders of a 2014 pro-democracy protest movement known as the “Umbrella Revolution” were convicted on public nuisance and other charges. The relationship between citizens and the authorities “has been completely deteriorated,” Labor Party Vice Chairman Fernando Cheung Chiu-hung told The Associated Press. “We’ve seen (the police) use extreme forces which are not proportional to the demonstration,” Cheung said Thursday. The demonstrators appeared little deterred, though they were taking pains to cloak their identities by wearing masks, declining to give their full names to journalists and using cash rather than registered, stored value cards to buy subway tickets. Heavy rain over the city put a damper on new demonstrations, although protesters interviewed Wednesday said they had no plans of giving up until Lam’s government dropped its plans for the amendments altogether. Lo, the police commissioner, defended the police handling of the clashes outside the government headquarters, saying officers only acted when they were charged by protesters carrying pavement bricks, planks and iron pipes from a nearby construction site. “We have absolutely no bad intention to cause trouble with anyone. We are just doing our duty,” he said. He said the protesters acted in a “violent and organized manner.” “We know the crowd is hostile and very unstable and we tried our best to avoid confrontation,” he said. The rancour over the extradition issue is capturing attention in Taiwan, a self-governed island that China claims as its own territory. On Thursday, Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen said Hong Kong’s situation shows the “one country, two systems” framework devised for Hong Kong when Britain handed the colony back to China – presented by Beijing as a formula for uniting Taiwan with the mainland – cannot work. The Hong Kong government should listen to its people and not rush to pass the legislation that sparked the protests, she told reporters.

The tensions come a year after President Donald Trump withdrew from Iran’s 2015 nuclear accord with world powers and restored crippling sanctions. May 5: John Bolton, the White House national security adviser and a long-time Iran hawk, announces the deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group and a bomber task force in response to “a number of troubling and escalatory indications and warnings,” without providing details. He threatens “unrelenting force” in response to any attack. May 8: Iran vows to enrich its uranium stockpile closer to weapons-grade levels starting July 7 if world powers fail to negotiate new terms for its nuclear deal. The U.S. responds by imposing sanctions on Iran’s metals industry. May 9: The European Union urges Iran to respect the nuclear deal and says it plans to continue trading with the country despite U.S. sanctions. Mr. Trump says he would like Iran’s leaders to “call me.” May 10: The U.S. says it will move a Patriot missile battery into the Middle East to counter threats from Iran. May 12: The United Arab Emirates says four commercial ships off its eastern coast “were subjected to sabotage operations,” just hours after Iranian and Lebanese media outlets air false reports of explosions at a nearby Emirati port. May 13: European foreign ministers urge the United States and Iran to show restraint, while Secretary of State Mike Pompeo briefs his counterparts on the alleged threats from Iran. Mr. Trump warns that if Tehran does “anything” in the form of an attack “they will suffer greatly.” May 14: Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthi rebels launch a drone attack on Saudi Arabia, striking a major oil pipeline and taking it out of service. — The New York Times reports the White House is reviewing military plans that could result in sending 120,000 U.S. troops to the Middle East if Iran attacks American forces or steps up work on nuclear weapons. Mr. Trump says it’s “fake news,” but that he would “absolutely” be willing to send troops if necessary. — Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei says “no one is seeking war,” but that it wouldn’t be difficult for Iran to enrich uranium to weapons-grade levels. — A senior military officer in the U.S.-backed coalition fighting the Islamic State group says “there’s been no increased threat from Iranian-backed forces in Iraq and Syria.” In a rare public rebuttal, U.S. Central Command says his remarks “run counter to the identified credible threats.” May 15: The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad orders all nonessential government staff to leave Iraq immediately. The Netherlands and Germany say they are suspending their training of Iraqi forces. May 16: Saudi Arabia blames Iran for the drone attack on its pipeline and an English-language newspaper close to the palace calls for the U.S. to launch “surgical” strikes in retaliation. — President Donald Trump says he hopes the U.S. is not on a path to war with Iran amid fears that his two most hawkish advisers could be angling for a conflict with the Islamic Republic. Asked if the U.S. was going to war with Iran, the president replied, “I hope not” — a day after he repeated a desire for dialogue, tweeting, “I’m sure that Iran will want to talk soon.” May 19: A rocket lands near the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, without harming anyone. It’s not clear who is behind the attack, but after the initial reports, Mr. Trump tweets: “If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran. Never threaten the United States again!” Iran’s foreign minister responded by tweeting that Mr. Trump had been “goaded” into “genocidal taunts.” May 20: Semi-official media in Iran report that it has quadrupled its production of low-enriched uranium, which is used for civilian applications but not nuclear weapons. Iran is allowed to enrich uranium to the low level of 3.67 per cent, but increased production could lead it to exceed the stockpile limits in the nuclear deal. May 24: President Donald Trump says the U.S. will bolster its military presence in the Middle East with an additional 1,500 troops. He says the troops will have a “mostly protective” role. — Senior Pentagon officer Vice Admiral Michael Gilday says the U.S. has a high degree of confidence that Iran’s Revolutionary Guard was responsible for the explosions of the four tankers in the Gulf of Oman, and that Iranian proxies in Iraq fired rockets into Baghdad. May 31 and June 1: Saudi Arabia’s King Salman hosts three high-level summits in Mecca, drawing heads of state from across the Middle East and Muslim countries to present a unified Muslim and Arab position on Iran. The monarch calls on the international community to use all means to confront Iran and accuses the Shiite power of being behind “terrorist operations” that targeted Saudi oil interests. June 12: Saudi Arabia says 26 people were wounded in an attack by Yemen’s Houthi rebels targeting an airport in kingdom’s southwestern town of Abha. The Houthis claim they’d launched a cruise missile at the airport. June 13: Two oil tankers near the strategic Strait of Hormuz were reportedly attacked in an assault that left one ablaze and adrift as 44 sailors were evacuated from both vessels and the U.S. Navy rushed to assist.

"315"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-putin-fires-two-senior-police-officers-involved-in-journalist-ivan/"|"Vladimir Isachenkov"|"Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday dismissed two senior police officers involved in the arrest of an investigative journalist on drug charges that were later dropped for lack of evidence, in a case that provoked national outrage. The firings, which came a day after massive arrests at a protest rally in the Russian capital, reflect a careful balancing act by the Kremlin, which seeks to assuage public anger while maintaining a tight lid on dissent. Last week’s arrest of Ivan Golunov on drug-dealing charges - which he rejected as sham - drew an unprecedented show of solidarity, with three top national newspapers publishing front pages demanding his release. The interior ministry dropped all charges against the reporter on Tuesday in a highly unusual move, and asked Mr .Putin to dismiss two senior officers who oversaw the case. The Kremlin on Thursday announced the ouster of Moscow police’s anti-drugs chief, Yuri Devyatkin, and head of the police department for western Moscow, Andrei Puchkov. The firings follow arrests at an unsanctioned, but peaceful, rally supporting Mr. Golunov in Moscow on Wednesday. Moscow police said about 200 people were detained, while independent monitoring group OVD-Info said more than 500 were taken into custody and some of them were beaten. The vast majority were released quickly without charges. Mr. Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Thursday that the Kremlin is aware of complaints about excessive use of force by police and expects an official inquiry to look into that. Mr. Peskov told reporters that the President will consider proposals to revise legislation to prevent police from using drug charges to frame innocent people. “If such initiative is formulated it will be considered,” he said. He added that it’s premature to conclude that Mr. Golunov’s case highlights an urgent need for sweeping police reforms, saying that the Kremlin would await the results of an official probe. The decision to drop charges against Mr. Golunov and fire police generals responsible for his arrest marks an unusual shift for the Kremlin, which has staunchly backed law-enforcement officials in other cases widely seen as trumped up. Observers say that this time, the damage from Mr. Golunov’s arrest was too big for the Kremlin to stick to the familiar pattern. They also say that the officials allegedly involved in fabricating the case were too insignificant to merit high-level protection. “Moscow police’s expectations for political support were rooted in their belief that the Kremlin wouldn’t act against those protecting its own security, and that was a major mistake,” analyst Tatiana Stanovaya wrote in a commentary for Moscow’s Carnegie Center. Ms. Stanovaya noted that the Kremlin was angry to see a big image problem resulting from a case apparently driven by personal interests of minor officials. “Golunov was freed not only because of public outrage, but because those who arrested him have no political value for Putin,” she wrote. “In the world of Putin, they are like dust.” "|"Putin fires two senior police officers involved in journalist Ivan Golunov’s case"|"2019-06-13T13:10:25-0400"|"Ivan Golunov,Vladimir Putin,Russia,Russian police,Russian journalist,free speech,news,world,kremlin,case,moscow,putin,arrest,police,outrage", 
"316"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-second-person-dies-from-ebola-in-uganda-after-outbreak-crosses-congo/"|"Rodney Muhumuza Jamey Keaten"|"The Congolese pastor who is thought to have caused the Ebola outbreak’s spread into Uganda was unknown to health officials before he died of the disease, the World Health Organization’s emergencies chief said Thursday. That underlines the problems in tracking the virus as a WHO expert panel on Friday discusses whether to declare a global health emergency. As a third relative of the pastor found infected in Uganda died, Dr. Mike Ryan told The Associated Press he did not believe the man had been on any list of high-risk Ebola contacts that health workers use to track infections and contain the outbreak. The three family members became infected with Ebola when they travelled from Uganda to Congo to visit him. His 5-year-old grandson became the first Ebola case in Uganda and the first death after several family members quietly returned home on footpaths that bypassed border screening for the disease. The boy’s grandmother and 3-year-old brother have since died, health officials said Thursday. “It’s an unfortunate occurrence that a pastor who’s taking care of people and providing care to people is himself infected in the line of his own work and then ultimately goes on to infect others,” Ryan said. The pastor’s positive test for Ebola came back only after he was buried, Dr. Dominique Kabongo, co-ordinator of Ebola response teams in Kasindi, told the AP. Family members traditionally wash and dress the corpse. More than 80 people attended the burial, Kabongo said. The first cross-border cases in this Ebola outbreak – the second-deadliest in history – have prompted the WHO expert committee to again consider declaring a global health emergency after twice deciding against it. Such declarations almost always boost attention and donor funding. Ryan said there is no evidence Ebola is spreading within Uganda and that authorities have contained the virus to the family. He said 27 people who may have been exposed are being followed. Ugandan authorities said three suspected Ebola cases not related to the family were awaiting test results. More than 1,400 people have died in this outbreak declared in August in eastern Congo, one of the world’s most turbulent regions, where rebel attacks and resistance by community members wary of authorities have badly hampered Ebola containment work. For months, officials have feared the virus would cross the heavily travelled border where health workers have been screening millions of people for fever and other symptoms. Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan have been preparing for possible cases. Uganda’s health ministry on Thursday said it no longer had any confirmed Ebola cases after all members of the Congolese-Ugandan family, including the parents and a six-month-old baby, were sent to Congo for monitoring and experimental treatments as part of clinical trials. There is no licensed treatment for the virus which can spread quickly via close contact with bodily fluids of those infected and can be fatal in up to 90% of cases. The family’s case shows the challenges in tracking those infected in an outbreak where an alarmingly high percentage of cases aren’t discovered until it is too late. Doctors Without Borders last month said as few as a third of new confirmed Ebola cases were linked back to known contacts of infected people. Ryan, the WHO’s emergencies chief, told the AP that about 55% of new Ebola cases in Congo last week were previously identified as potential contacts, suggesting significant problems remain. Many people are still dying at home instead of seeking treatment, and their burials put loved ones at risk of infection. Authorities in Congo and Uganda have vowed to step up border security after several members of the family, already showing symptoms of Ebola, were stopped at a Congolese border post but later slipped away and into Uganda. Five family members who stayed in Congo have tested positive for Ebola, Congo’s health ministry said. Health teams in Uganda “are not panicking,” Henry Mwebesa, the national director of health services, told the AP on Wednesday. He cited the East African nation’s experience battling previous outbreaks of Ebola and other hemorrhagic fevers. For the first time an experimental but effective Ebola vaccine is being widely used, with more than 132,000 in Congo receiving it. Uganda is more stable than eastern Congo, and it has vaccinated nearly 4,700 health workers. WHO is shipping another 3,500 doses this week for health workers and contacts of those infected.

"317"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-sudans-ruling-military-council-holds-talks-with-us-diplomats/"|"Khalid Abdelaziz"|"The head of Sudan’s ruling military council held talks on Thursday with the senior U.S. diplomat for Africa, who was visiting Khartoum to encourage a transition to democracy two months after the overthrow of former President Omar al-Bashir. Tibor Nagy, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for Africa, met with Lieutenant-General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, said the council, which released a photo of the meeting. Veteran diplomat Donald Booth, who was appointed U.S. envoy to Sudan on Wednesday, was also present. “Burhan expressed Sudan’s aspiration to strengthen its relations with the United States as a superpower that has a positive role which the Sudanese people looks up to,” the military council said in a statement. The United States was helping the continuing political negotiations between the council and the opposition, it added. Stalled talks between the council and an alliance of opposition groups over who should control a three-year transition toward elections collapsed after a June 3 raid on a protest sit-in that left dozens dead. The bloodshed in Sudan has prompted concern from world powers including the United States, which sanctioned Sudan under Mr. al-Bashir over its alleged support for militant groups and the civil war in Darfur. Trade sanctions were lifted in 2017 but Sudan is still on the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism, which prevents it from accessing badly needed funding from international lenders. Washington previously said it will not take Sudan off the list while the military remains in power. Stability in the country of 40 million people is crucial for a volatile region struggling with conflict and insurgencies from the Horn of Africa to Egypt and Libya. The military council has been bolstered by support from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which between them have offered US$3-billion in aid. Mr. Nagy already met with the opposition alliance and held talks with Sudan’s acting deputy foreign minister Ilham Ibrahim on Wednesday. Earlier on Thursday Sudan’s state prosecutor’s office said that Mr. al-Bashir had been charged with corruption after the completion of an investigation. Mr. al-Bashir was overthrown and arrested in a coup by the military on April 11 after months of mass protests against his autocratic 30-year rule. The charges were related to laws on “suspected illicit wealth and emergency orders,” the public prosecutor’s office said without giving more details. Mr. al-Bashir had already been charged in May with incitement and involvement in the killing of protesters. Prosecutors had also ordered his interrogation on suspicion of money laundering and financing terrorism. It has not been possible to get a comment from Mr. al-Bashir since his removal.

"318"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-britains-conservative-party-set-to-narrow-field-in-leadership/"|"Elizabeth Piper Kylie MacLellan William James"|"Boris Johnson, who has pledged to deliver Brexit on Oct. 31, surged closer to power on Thursday, winning by far the most support from Conservative lawmakers in the first round of the contest to replace Prime Minister Theresa May. Three years since voting to leave the European Union with a 52 per cent majority, the United Kingdom is heading toward a possible crisis over Brexit as most of the candidates vying to succeed May are prepared to leave on Oct. 31 without a deal. While parliament has indicated it will try to stop a no-deal Brexit, which investors warn would hurt financial markets and the world economy, some of those running say it may be the only way for Britain to leave the bloc without further delay. Mr. Johnson, the face of the official campaign to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum, won the support of 114 Conservative lawmakers in the first round of the contest to replace May. A total of 313 lawmakers voted. “Thank you to my friends and colleagues in the Conservative & Unionist Party for your support. I am delighted to win the first ballot, but we have a long way to go,” Mr. Johnson said on Twitter. His closest rivals were: Jeremy Hunt, the foreign minister, who won 43 votes; Michael Gove, environment minister, with 37 votes and Dominic Raab, former Brexit minister, on 27 votes. Sajid Javid, interior minister, came fifth with 23 votes. Matt Hancock won 20 votes and Rory Stewart 19. Three were knocked out: former leader of the House of Commons Andrea Leadsom, Mark Harper and Esther McVey. Betting markets give Mr. Johnson, who has a long record of scandals and gaffes, a 70-per-cent probability of winning the top job. Mr. Johnson, a former London mayor and foreign minister, has spent weeks wooing Conservative lawmakers, staying out of the spotlight with a low-key campaign at odds with his flamboyant publicity stunts of the past. But his spokesman, while celebrating a higher-than-expected number of supporters, said there was still “a long way to go in the contest and you have to hold the numbers to go into the next rounds and that’s the challenge”. The second round is due on June 18 with further ballots planned for June 19 and June 20, until there are just two candidates. A postal ballot of the wider Conservative Party membership will then be held to pick a leader. A new prime minister should be chosen by the end of July. There had been speculation that the contest could be accelerated due to Johnson’s strong lead but there was no immediate sign of rivals bowing out of the race. Some were quick to make veiled warnings about the front-runner. Mr. Hunt, who has pitched himself as a unifier of both Brexit-supporting and pro-EU Conservatives, warned members of the party that “the stakes have rarely been higher for our country”. “This serious moment calls for a serious leader,” he tweeted. Mr. Stewart, who has criticized Johnson for making promises on Brexit he cannot keep, voiced optimism about his campaign: “This is amazing – we’re getting some real momentum here … It’s increasingly clear it’s me against Boris. And let’s win.” Finance Minister Philip Hammond, who has not publicly endorsed a candidate, wrote on Thursday to all remaining leadership contenders to urge them to stick to existing budget rules until at least the next scheduled election in 2022. Mr. Johnson has proposed cutting income tax to 20 per cent from 40 per cent for those earning between £50,000 to £80,000 ($85,000-$135,000), while Mr. Gove has suggested replacing value-added tax on goods and services with a narrower sales tax. Mr. Johnson kicked off his official campaign on Wednesday with a pledge to lead Britain out of the EU on Oct. 31, and a warning to his divided Conservative Party that “delay means defeat”. “After three years and two missed deadlines, we must leave the EU on October 31,” Mr. Johnson, 54, said then. “I am not aiming for a no-deal outcome.” Mr. Johnson, whose unconventional style has helped him shrug off a series of scandals in the past, has won over much of his party by arguing that only he can rescue the Conservatives by delivering Brexit. He argues that if Britain is prepared for a no-deal Brexit, the EU will bend to his argument to remove the so-called Northern Irish backstop to prevent a return to a hard border with Ireland if there is no agreed future trade deal. But the EU has refused to renegotiate the Withdrawal Agreement reached with May last November and Ireland has said it is not willing to change the backstop. On Wednesday, the European Commission said: “In light of the continued uncertainty in the United Kingdom … and the overall domestic political situation, a ‘no-deal’ scenario on 1 November, 2019, very much remains a possible – although undesirable – outcome.” "|"Boris Johnson secures most support after first round of contest to succeed Britain’s Theresa May"|"2019-06-13T07:52:40-0400"|"Britain,Conservative Party,Theresa May,Brexit,EU,Boris Johnson,Michael Gove,Jeremy Hunt,Sajid Javid,Andrea Leadsom,news,world,minister,brexit,contest", 
"319"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-ecuador-approves-same-sex-marriage-as-lgbt-groups-hail-landmark-week-2/"|"Oscar Lopez"|"Ecuador’s decision to allow same-sex marriage has topped a landmark week for LGBTQ rights after Botswana decriminalized gay sex and Bhutan took the first steps to do so, said campaigners marking the 50th anniversary of the gay equality movement. Five of nine judges in Ecuador’s top court on Wednesday ruled in favour of two gay couples who sued after their request to be married was denied by the country’s civil registry. The Latin American country is the 27th country to allow same-sex marriage with the move coming during the annual gay Pride month and events to mark the 50th year of the Stonewall riots in New York that gave rise to the global movement for LGBTQ rights. A day earlier, Botswana’s top court voted to decriminalize homosexuality and Bhutan’s lower house six days ago voted to repeal a similar law that needs upper chamber approval. This would leave 68 countries where same-sex relations are illegal. “The victories we’ve witnessed in the last couple of weeks will improve the lives of millions of LGBT+ people around the world,” said Mathias Wasik, director of programs at international LGBT rights group All Out. “We’re witnessing an important moment in history as these victories will send out positive shock waves across the world and inspire more activists to continue their fight for LGBT+ rights,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by e-mail. Despite the recent milestones, however, LGBTQ rights advocates cautioned that significant global challenges remain. In May, Kenya’s high court upheld the country’s ban on gay sex, so same-sex relations remain punishable by 14 years in jail, and Brunei announced but then reversed a decision to impose death by stoning for gay sex after a global backlash. Campaigns in some countries during parliamentary elections in the European Union in May were characterized by anti-gay rhetoric including by Poland’s Law and Justice Party and Spain’s far-right Vox party challenging acceptance of LGBTQ rights. In the United States in January, the Supreme Court lifted lower court rulings that blocked a Trump administration ban on certain transgender people from serving in the U.S. military, allowing the policy to go into effect. “Whenever there’s progress, there’s always steps backwards,” said Neela Ghoshal, senior researcher in the LGBT rights program at Human Rights Watch. Voters worldwide have supported leaders with anti-gay views. Last year, Brazilians elected far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro as president, a man who once said he would rather his son die in an accident than bring home a male partner. Campaigns for LGBTQ rights have been met with steep resistance, particularly in countries where the influence of conservative religion sways politics such as in countries in Africa, the Middle East and Latin America. “Conservatives around social issues, particularly religious conservatives, take progress [on LGBT rights] as a threat to their belief system,” Ms. Ghoshal said. In Ecuador, where the church is very influential, the Life and Family movement, a right-wing Christian group, led much of the opposition to same-sex marriage. They argued marriage was determined by a 2008 constitution, which granted civil unions to same-sex couples, and any further changes required a referendum or amendment in parliament. “The vast majority of the Ecuadorian people, through referendum, approved a constitution that … reserved marriage for heterosexual, male/female couples,” Carlos Arsenio Larco, a lawyer for the group, told local TV channel El Comercio. Ecuador’s LGBTQ community celebrated the decision. “After a fight of almost 20 years, gay marriage has been achieved. It gives us a guiding light for many other proposals on human rights,” said Diane Rodriguez, president of the Ecuadorian Federation of LGBTI Organizations and the first trans woman elected to Ecuador’s National Assembly.

"320"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-us-bishops-agree-to-new-oversight-system-in-answer-to-ongoing/"|"Liam Stack"|"The United States’ Roman Catholic bishops voted Thursday to enact a new oversight system intended to hold them accountable for abuse and cover-ups, a move meant to restore faith in a church whose epidemic of misconduct has driven away parishioners and attracted the attention of state and federal law enforcement. The move was endorsed at a high-stakes gathering in Baltimore of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. It came one month after Pope Francis issued a sweeping edict that ordered church officials around the world to report cases of sexual abuse — and attempted cover-ups — to their superiors. The decree gave bishops one year to establish new procedures. The Catholic Church is fighting fires on many fronts. Attorneys general in at least a dozen states are investigating abuse and cover-up allegations against the church, Mass attendance is declining, and a string of bishop scandals has deepened mistrust of its leadership. The highest-profile prelate to be implicated was former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick of Washington, who was expelled from the priesthood in February after the church found him guilty of abusing children and adult seminarians. The president of the bishops’ conference, Cardinal Daniel DiNardo of Galveston-Houston, has himself been accused of mishandling abuse claims, including a case that led federal agents to raid his office in 2018. The system adopted this week includes a hotline for reporting allegations against bishops and procedures that detail how claims should be investigated by senior bishops called metropolitans. Abuse survivors and reform advocates called the move a step in the right direction, but they also expressed concern over what they said were its shortcomings. Chief among them: the system does not order church officials to report allegations to law enforcement unless there is a claim of child sex abuse or unless local law requires them to alert the police. Absent those conditions, they can opt to conduct an internal investigation. But Cardinal Joseph Tobin of Newark, New Jersey, told reporters Thursday that he thought bishops were unlikely to take that route. He said that the pope had laid out a role for the police that “wouldn’t be as specific as we would like it in the United States,” but that he hoped local arrangements between dioceses and police departments would encourage them to work together. “I am confident that the idea of doing this in-house is long gone,” he said. Victims’ advocates also expressed worries that the system does not require lay people, who play an advisory role in inquiries into rank-and-file priests, to be involved in investigating bishops. That concern was aired in a speech to the bishops Tuesday by Francesco Cesareo, chairman of the National Review Board for the Protection of Children and Young People, a lay group that advises the church on abuse investigations. He said not requiring lay involvement “means bishops policing bishops.” “Not involving laity with competence and expertise in leading the review process would signal a continuation of a culture of self-preservation that would suggest complicity,” Cesareo said. Some bishops at the conference lobbied for the system to include mandatory lay participation, but they were unsuccessful. On Tuesday, a panel of bishops said the text of the pope’s decree — which did not mandate lay involvement — had tied their hands. “We could not go beyond what the Holy Father has given,” said Bishop Robert Deeley of Portland, Maine, at a news conference. Tobin said Thursday that lay people would inevitably be involved in investigating bishops, even if the legislation enacting the system did not require it. “The possibility of doing that without qualified lay people is next to impossible,” he said. “It is impossible, and it would be highly irresponsible.” When the abuse crisis engulfed the church in 2002, U.S. bishops met in Dallas to draft a road map for investigating allegations and punishing abusers. That charter required review boards made up of lay people to play an advisory role in investigations into rank-and-file priests, said Nicholas Cafardi, a canon lawyer and former chairman of the National Review Board. But it did not apply to the bishops. Church officials frequently point to the charter as a watershed moment that led to a decrease in the number of new child abuse cases. “Now we have a new issue and new problem with the conduct of some bishops, and we are addressing that with the tools that were successful in 2002,” Deeley said Thursday. “It would be false to say that we didn’t get it and we didn’t do it.” Cafardi said the new system was “certainly a step forward.” But he said he was “slightly disappointed” that it did not repeat the 2002 charter’s insistence on lay involvement. “The system really perpetuates clericalism, which is something Pope Francis has criticized in other situations — the idea that priests exist on a different level than lay people and bishops exist on a different level than priests, and that’s by divine origin and you can’t even talk about changing it,” Cafardi said. Advocates for abuse survivors said it was not clear that the new system would work in practice. “The situation right now is that the review board in each diocese reports to and advises the bishop, so what do you do in a situation where the person you report to is the person accused?” said Terry McKiernan, president of BishopAccountability.org. He pointed to accusations in an Associated Press report last week that DiNardo had mishandled sexual and financial misconduct allegations against his deputy, Monsignor Frank Rossi. The church has pushed back against criticism of DiNardo but said it would investigate claims in the report for violations of church law. “The bishops, they are basically executive, legislative and judicial power in their dioceses,” McKiernan said. “Now they are in the uncomfortable role of trying to construct a system that somehow has checks and balances.” "|"U.S. bishops agree to new oversight system in answer to ongoing scandal "|"2019-06-13T21:56:27-0400"|"BISHOPS,CHURCH,ABUSE,831,Roman Catholic Bishops,Pope Francis,sexual assault,cover-up,scandal,criminal investigation,new oversight system,U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops,abuse crisis,church,system",

"322"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-man-accused-in-new-zealand-mosque-killings-pleads-not-guilty-2/"|"Nick Perry"|"The man accused of the New Zealand mosque attacks smirked as his lawyer entered not guilty pleas to terrorism, murder and attempted murder charges Friday before a judge who set his trial for next May. The courtroom was filled with 80 survivors and family members of the 51 who were slain, while about another 60 watched the hearing on video in an overflow room at the Christchurch High Court. Four cultural advisers and other staff were assigned to help the victims and family members understand the proceedings and the next steps in the case. A man who addressed the survivors said they had been praying during the holy month of Ramadan and that the Muslim community would help and support each other during the coming weeks and months. Brenton Tarrant, the 28-year-old Australian accused of the attacks, appeared at the hearing via video link from a small room at the maximum security prison in Auckland where he’s being held. The link was muted and he didn’t attempt to speak. Other than smirking a couple of times, Tarrant showed little emotion during the hearing. When Judge Cameron Mander asked if he could hear and see what was going on in the courtroom, Tarrant nodded. At times he looked around the room and stretched his neck. The judge did not allow cameras or video in the courtroom although did approve a sketch artist commissioned by The Associated Press. Tarrant has been charged with 51 counts of murder, 40 counts of attempted murder and one terrorism charge in relation to the March 15 shootings. Mander said the findings of two mental-health assessments showed Tarrant had no issues related to his ability to enter pleas and stand trial. The assessments are standard in murder cases. The judge scheduled a six-week trial to begin May 4. Tarrant will remain in custody ahead of his next hearing in mid-August. Outside the court, police and court security staff escorted a man away after he got into an argument with survivors and family members, who later said the man was saying things supportive of white supremacist ideology. Police said they arrested a 33-year-old man and charged him with disorderly behaviour. Janna Ezat wore a shirt that she’d designed which featured an image of her son Hussein Al-Umari, who was killed in the attacks. She said the court hearing had made her angry. “Before I was OK and calm and believe in this life my son died and he is in a good place,” she said. “But when I saw the terrorist, he was just, he’s nothing. Just sitting like that. Pretending that he’s innocent and nothing is wrong.” She said she thought the shooter deserved to be given the death penalty, even though New Zealand no longer institutes the punishment. “It’s not easy to lose your child. Not only my child, but 50 people,” Ezat said. “It’s unfair. It’s unfair. And he was laughing.” Abdul Aziz, who is considered a hero for confronting the gunman at the Linwood mosque, said he wouldn’t say the suspect’s name. “He’s a coward. And behind the cell he’s laughing,” Aziz said. “He should have laughed when I faced him. Then I would see how he laugh. He run like a dog. He run like a chicken.” In the March 15 attacks during Friday prayers, 42 worshippers were killed at the Al Noor mosque and seven were killed at the Linwood mosque. Two more people died later at the Christchurch Hospital. The shooter livestreamed much of the attack on Facebook. Tarrant had earlier published a 74-page manifesto espousing a white supremacist philosophy and detailing his plans to attack the mosques. New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has vowed never to say the accused man’s name. Last month she helped lead a global pledge named the “Christchurch Call,” aimed at boosting efforts to keep internet platforms from being used to spread hate, organize extremist groups and broadcast attacks.

"323"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-support-waivers-in-hong-kong-for-proposed-bill-allowing-extraditions/"|"James Pomfret Farah Master"|"Cracks appeared on Friday in the support base for a proposed Hong Kong law to allow extraditions to China, and opponents of the bill said they would stage more demonstrations after hundreds of thousands took to the streets this week. The extradition bill, which will cover Hong Kong residents and foreign and Chinese nationals living or travelling in the city, has many concerned it may threaten the rule of law that underpins Hong Kong’s international financial status. Opposition to the bill on Sunday triggered the former British colony’s biggest political demonstration since its return to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” deal. The agreement guarantees Hong Kong’s special autonomy, including freedom of assembly, free press and independent judiciary. Many accuse China of extensive meddling since then, including obstruction of democratic reforms, interference with elections and of being behind the disappearance of five Hong Kong-based booksellers, starting in 2015, who specialized in works critical of Chinese leaders. The extradition bill has so spooked some in Hong Kong that some of the territory’s tycoons have started moving personal wealth offshore, according to financial advisers, bankers and lawyers familiar with the details. On Friday, one of the key advisers to Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, Executive Council member Bernard Chan, told Cable TV he did not think formal discussion of the bill, a precursor to a final vote by the legislature, should continue at present. “Do we consult, strengthen the bill, or what? Is there still any chance of the bill passing? These are all factors the government must consider,” he said. “But I definitely say that right now it’s not possible – at a time when there are such intense divisions – to keep discussing this issue. The difficulty is very high.” Michael Tien, a member of Hong Kong’s legislature and a deputy to China’s national parliament, urged the city government to put the bill on hold. And 22 former government officials or Legislative Council members, including former security secretary Peter Lai Hing-ling, signed a statement calling on Lam to “yield to public opinion and withdraw the Bill for more thorough deliberation”. “It is time for Hong Kong to have a cool-down period,” Lai told Reuters. “Let frayed tempers settle before we resume discussion of this controversial issue. Please, no more bloodletting!” Beijing-backed Lam has stood by the bill, saying it is necessary to plug loopholes that allow criminals wanted on the mainland to use the city as a haven. She has said Hong Kong courts would safeguard human rights. Lam has not appeared in public or commented since Wednesday. China, where courts are controlled by the Communist Party, has rejected accusations of undermining Hong Kong’s freedoms. Beijing has pointed a finger at foreign governments for supporting the demonstrators. On Friday Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng summoned a senior U.S. diplomat in Beijing to lodge a protest against recent U.S. comments and actions on Hong Kong and the extradition law. He urged Washington to stop interfering in the city’s affairs immediately. “We urge the U.S. side to treat the Hong Kong government objectively and fairly and respect its normal legislative process,” the statement cited Le as saying. Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Hong Kong matters were an internal affair for China and nobody had a right to interfere. “Any vain plots to cause chaos in Hong Kong or to damage Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability will be resolutely opposed by the whole people of China including the vast majority of Hong Kong compatriots,” he said. “This does not enjoy popular support and will not succeed.” The proposed bill has thrown Hong Kong, a city of about 7 million people, into turmoil, starting on Sunday with a march that drew what organizers said was more than a million people. Tens of thousands demonstrated in the following days. On Wednesday, protesters surrounded the legislature and swarmed on to a major highway, before being forced back by riot police firing volleys of tear gas and rubber bullets. On Friday, police kept a close watch as the city returned to normal, with most protesters retreating and businesses reopening. But further demonstrations are planned. Organizers have urged people to take to the streets on Sunday and protesters have applied for a permit to gather on Monday, when legislators may reconvene to discuss the bill. The Confederation of Trade Unions and Professional Teachers Union called for a city-wide strike. A few dozen demonstrators clustered throughout the day on Friday near the legislature, which had been scheduled to debate the bill this week. “Everyone is planning for a big march on Sunday like last week but no one knows what will happen at night or after,” said a woman surnamed Chan, who was helping at a makeshift first aid and supply station. In the evening, hundreds of people loosely affiliated with a group that calls itself ‘Hong Kong Mothers’ assembled peacefully to show their opposition to the proposed legislation. Police have made more than a dozen arrests, some in hospitals and university campuses, while scores were wounded in the clashes. In the United States, senior congressional lawmakers from both parties introduced legislation to require an annual justification from the U.S. government for the continuation of special business and trade privileges to Hong Kong. China called on the United States not to pass such legislation. The hawkish Chinese newspaper, the Global Times, lambasted foreign leaders for being hypocrites and said their failure to condemn violent demonstrators was “a stark provocation”.

"324"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-high-rise-fires-still-a-major-concern-two-years-after-grenfell/"|"Jill Lawless"|"Two years after a tower block fire in London killed 72 people, safety experts warned that hundreds of apartment buildings around Britain remain at risk of a similar devastating blaze. Survivors, neighbours and politicians including London Mayor Sadiq Khan attended a church service of remembrance on Friday for the Grenfell Tower blaze, the deadliest fire on British soil since the Second World War. Anger is still raw in the west London neighbourhood, where the public housing tower stands covered in white sheeting, a green heart and the words “Grenfell forever in our hearts” emblazoned at the top. Many at the service wore scarves of bright green, which has become a colour of remembrance for the fire. The congregation murmured agreement as Bishop of Kensington Graham Tomlin called the fire a “national shame.” “Grenfell happened because we failed to love our neighbours,” he said. Doves were released outside St. Helen’s Church, close to Grenfell, and mourners left floral wreaths at the base of the 24-story tower. The blaze began in an apartment kitchen and ripped through the tower in the early hours of June 14, 2017. Investigators found that the building’s flammable aluminum and polyethylene cladding helped the fire race out of control. A public inquiry and is still under way – looking, among other things, at the role of the combustible cladding – and police are considering criminal charges. But survivors and fire safety activists say the official response has been too slow. Many accuse years of British government public spending cuts for contributing to a decline in safety standards. The Conservative government has pledged hundreds of millions of pounds (dollars) to remove such cladding from both privately owned and public-housing buildings, but work has been slow. Citing figures from the Building Safety Program, the BBC reported that of 328 buildings with similar combustible cladding to Grenfell, only 105 have had it removed. Questions have also been raised about whether lives were lost because of the fire department’s advice to residents to stay in their apartments and await rescue. The advice was changed almost two hours after the fire broke out, but that was too late for many residents on the tower’s upper floors to escape. Police are considering corporate and individual manslaughter charges over the blaze, but say it’s unlikely anyone will be charged before late 2021. Separately, almost 250 survivors and relatives of the dead have launched a lawsuit in a U.S. court against firms that supplied materials used on the building, including cladding manufacturer Arconic Inc. and insulation maker Celotex. Yvette Williams of campaign group Justice 4 Grenfell said survivors and the bereaved are “increasingly feeling a sense of injustice, rather than a walk to justice.” “I think foremost in people’s minds will be: 72 dead, still no arrests, how come?” she said.

The judge at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Friday set a full extradition hearing for Feb. 25, 2020. It is expected to last about five days. Interim hearings are expected in July and October. Mr. Assange, who has been suffering from ill health in prison, appeared in court via video link. He appeared to be tired and showed signs of a possible hand tremor. He was again sporting a gray-white beard after having shaved it off before his previous court appearance. Ben Brandon, a British lawyer representing the U.S. government, told a hearing that the case “related to one of the largest compromises of confidential information in the history of the United States.” U.S. officials are seeking to prosecute Mr. Assange under the Espionage Act, blaming him for directing WikiLeaks’ publication of a huge trove of secret documents that disclosed the names of people who provided confidential information to American and coalition forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. The 47-year-old Australian hacker is currently in Belmarsh Prison on the outskirts of London serving a 50-week sentence for jumping bail in Britain. His legal team is appealing that sentence. He also faces questioning from Swedish prosecutors investigating a rape allegation. Mr. Assange faces 18 charges from the U.S., including conspiracy to hack into government computers. Citing the possible maximum prison term he could face if convicted on all counts, Mr. Assange said: “One hundred and seventy-five years of my life is effectively at stake.” Mr. Assange complained about what he characterized as inaccurate reporting on his case, citing the BBC in particular, and saying the press has mistakenly reported that he is accused of computer hacking. “That’s false,” he told Justice Emma Arbuthnot, asserting that the U.S. government has not accused him of hacking. However, Mr. Brandon told the judge that the U.S. case does include a hacking charge. The judge agreed and said it is her understanding that there is a hacking charge and suggested Mr. Assange discuss it with his lawyers. Mr. Assange also complained that he has not yet received the full U.S. indictment against him because his lawyers aren’t allowed to give him documents and can only send him papers through the mail. Justice Arbuthnot said the paperwork only arrived on Thursday and that “no one” has had a chance to fully read it. Mr. Assange asserts that he is a journalist with First Amendment protections and the U.S. decision to use espionage charges against him has alarmed many free-speech advocates. Mr. Assange’s lawyer, Mark Summers, said the case represents an outrageous and full-frontal assault on journalistic rights.

"326"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-who-likely-to-declare-international-emergency-over-ebola-epidemic/"|"Jamey Keaten Maria Cheng"|"The World Health Organization on Friday said the Ebola outbreak in Congo – which spilled into Uganda this week – is an “extraordinary event” of deep concern but does not yet merit being declared a global emergency. The UN health agency convened its expert committee for the third time to assess the outbreak which some experts say met criteria to be designated an international emergency long ago. This outbreak, the second-deadliest in history, has killed more than 1,400 people since it was declared in August. Three members of the family who brought the virus into Uganda have died after attending the burial of an infected relative, a popular pastor, in Congo. Speaking to journalists after the meeting, Dr. Preben Aavitsland, the acting chair of the committee, announced that the outbreak is “a health emergency in the Democratic Republic of the Congo”, but that the situation should not be declared a global one. For such a declaration, an outbreak must constitute a risk to other countries and require a co-ordinated response. The declaration typically triggers more funding, resources and political attention. Dr. Aavitsland said the committee was “deeply disappointed” that WHO and affected countries have not received the funding needed to stop the outbreak, and delivered a blunt message to donors: “Step up.” WHO said US$54-million is needed. Dr. Aavitsland added that declaring an emergency could have “unintended consequences”, such as airlines stopping flights or governments closing borders. “It was the view of the committee that there is really nothing to gain by declaring a [global emergency], but there is potentially a lot to lose,” he said. The outbreak, occurring close to the borders of Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan, has been like no other. Mistrust has been high in a region that had never faced Ebola before and attacks by rebel groups have undermined aid efforts. Several health workers have been killed. On Thursday, WHO’s emergencies chief acknowledged the agency has been unable to track the origins of nearly half of new Ebola cases in Congo amid the challenges, suggesting that it doesn’t know where the virus is spreading. Friday’s announcement quickly drew criticism from some experts. “I respect the advice of the emergency committee, but do believe a public-health emergency of international concern would have been justified,” said Dr. Jeremy Farrar, director of Wellcome, one of Britain’s biggest donors and a funder of Ebola vaccine research. “The epidemic is in a frightening phase and shows no sign of stopping anytime soon,” he said in a statement. Congo’s health minister, Dr. Oly Ilunga, told Associated Press that WHO’s decision to not declare the outbreak a global emergency was a testament to the country’s response efforts, which he called “effective.” In Uganda, authorities said the country now had just one suspected Ebola case, who had no contact with the infected family and remained in isolation. They did not give more details. Ninety-eight contacts with infected people have been identified. The health minister on Friday asked Ugandans not to shake hands or otherwise touch each other “until we are Ebola-free.” Alexandra Phelan, a global health expert at Georgetown University, said the legal criteria for declaring Ebola a global emergency have long been met even before the virus reached Uganda. “Given that we are still seeing daily numbers of cases in the double digits and we do not have adequate surveillance, this indicates the outbreak is a persistent regional risk,” she said. Prof. Phelan said she was concerned WHO might have been swayed by political considerations. As the far deadlier 2014-16 Ebola outbreak raged in West Africa, WHO was heavily criticized for not declaring a global emergency until nearly 1,000 people had died and the virus had spread to at least three countries. Internal WHO documents later showed the agency feared the declaration would have economic and social implications for Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. Dr. Axelle Ronsse, emergency co-ordinator for Médecins Sans Frontières, was unsure whether a declaration would help. She said outbreak responders, including WHO, should re-evaluate their strategies to contain the spiralling outbreak. “It’s quite clear that it’s not under control,” she said. “Now may be the time to reset and see what should be changed at this point.” "|"Ebola outbreak an ‘extraordinary event’ of deep concern, but not a global emergency: WHO"|"2019-06-14T07:50:56-0400"|"Ebola,WHO,international emergency,Congo,Uganda,health,UN,public health,news,world,outbreak,emergency,declaration,congo,uganda", 
"327"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-sudans-ruling-military-acknowledges-security-forces-committed/"|"Bassam Hatoum Noha Elhennawy"|"Sudan’s ruling military acknowledged that security forces committed violations when they moved in to disperse protesters at a sit-in camp outside military headquarters in Khartoum last week, and a major human-rights organization said Friday the need for an outside investigation was more urgent than ever in light of the admission. The spokesman for the ruling military council, Gen. Shams Eddin Kabashi, told reporters at a news conference late Thursday that an investigation was underway and that several military officers were already in custody for alleged “deviation” from the action plan set by military leaders. “We feel sorry for what happened,” Gen. Kabashi said. “We will show no leniency and we will hold accountable anyone, regardless of their rank, if proven to have committed violations.” Gen. Kabashi did not elaborate on the violations beyond describing them as “painful and outrageous.” Over 100 people were killed in the capital and across Sudan in a sweeping crackdown last week, according to protest organizers. Protesters also said more than 40 bodies were pulled from the Nile River in Khartoum and taken away by security forces. In response, Amnesty International called Friday for an international probe. “Following this admission, it is now more urgent than ever, in the interest of accountability and transparency, that the military authorities allow international scrutiny and investigations by the UN and African Union into the escalating human-rights violations under their watch,” said Sarah Jackson, Amnesty’s deputy regional director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes. The dispersal of the sit-in was a violent turn in the standoff between the protesters and the military, which removed President Omar al-Bashir from power in April after a months-long popular uprising against his 30-year rule. Gen. Kabashi admitted that the members of the transitional military council had convened the night before the sit-in was dispersed and agreed to drive protesters away. Forces for the Declaration of Freedom and Change, a coalition of political groups representing the protesters, also insisted on an international investigation – a demand Gen. Kabashi strongly rejected. On Thursday, UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict Pramila Patten expressed “grave concern” over reports of mass rapes of protesters and female medical personnel by security forces and militias. Human Rights Watch urged the Sudanese military to restore access to the internet, which has been blocked since the start of the clampdown. Gen. Kabashi ruled that out, alleging the use of social media has posed a threat to national security. Sudanese protesters have relied heavily on social media to post video depicting violence perpetrated by security forces, mobilize rallies and co-ordinate dissent. Separately, Gen. Kabashi dismissed the death toll announced by the Sudanese Doctors Central Committee, a group associated with the protesters, as misleading. The group has said 108 people were killed and more than 500 wounded. The military-controlled Health Ministry later put the death toll at 61. Following last week’s violence, Ethiopia stepped up its diplomatic efforts to mediate the crisis. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed visited Khartoum, held several rounds of separate talks with the generals and pro-democracy forces and appointed a special envoy. Gen. Kabashi said Ethiopian mediators did not put forward any proposal that could ease disagreements but have only sought to encourage both parties to resume direct talks. In the wake of the military crackdown, talks between the military and protesters were suspended and the FDFC held a three-day general strike and a campaign of civil disobedience. Leaders of the protest movement said earlier they would not sit down with the generals until they acknowledged last week’s “massacre,” allowed the formation of an international commission to investigate the killings of protesters, restored internet services, adhered to previous deals struck before the breakdown in talks and send paramilitary troops back to their barracks. While admitting the military’s responsibility for the killings, Gen. Kabashi insisted the question of deploying troops is a military affair that no one should tamper with.

"328"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-hong-kongs-youth-anxious-to-be-heard-by-china-are-turning-from-talk/"|"Nathan VanderKlippe"|"In depth • Nathan VanderKlippe gives the backstory behind his video of protesters On a sticky Wednesday afternoon, Pauline Yeung found a place to sit on Tim Mei Avenue, on the edge of the crowds that had surrounded this city’s Legislative Council. It would be another 90 minutes before clouds of tear gas seared the eyes and lungs of those gathered here, as police used baton charges, rubber bullets and pepper balls to clear away tens of thousands of people protesting a proposed extradition bill. The bill would make it easier for authorities in mainland China to legally seize those they call fugitive criminals, and has raised concern that it could subject people in Hong Kong to justice in courts that answer to the Communist Party of China. Worry about the extradition bill was encapsulated in a single sign posted this week: “First: Canadians Kovrig & Spavor. Next: You & Me?” But a nervous energy coursed through the air as Ms. Yeung perched on the edge of a planter, thinking about the familiar contours of protest in this place – and how this time, she hoped, things would be different, even if that meant embracing violence. In China, the Communist Party secured its rule “through guns,” she says. “So if Hong Kong people want to gain back our rights, unless there is bleeding or guns or violence – it’s impossible. Because that’s the way the Chinese government works.” It was firebrand language, but delivered in a contemplative tone, one born of a demoralization that has darkened the demeanour of a young generation in a city plagued by tensions in recent years. In 2014, Ms. Yeung spent nearly three months on these streets amid a lengthy protest, known as the Umbrella Movement, to demand greater democratic representation for people in Hong Kong, where Chinese leadership in Beijing holds heavy sway. Ms. Yeung, 23, was so committed to the cause that she slept on the streets for all but a night or two, showering in a nearby sports centre. For 75 days, she and others called for change in a lengthy demonstration notable for its calm – with students doing homework on the streets and people listening to impromptu lectures on history and politics. But months of peaceful protest failed to achieve anything of note. Its dissolution was such a defeating event that Ms. Yeung left Hong Kong for a year, moving to Taiwan. When she returned, she became a nurse, determined to contribute to social good. But on Wednesday, she was back on the streets, and imbued with new ambition. “People are a lot readier to go to fight or to sacrifice,” she said. What Hong Kong will do with the extradition bill is unclear. With new protests planned for Sunday and Monday, a legislative schedule included no hearings for Monday and Tuesday, while government advisers emerged to recommend a pause. “Personally, I can see that it is impossible to discuss when there is so much conflict on all sides,” Bernard Chan, a close adviser to Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam, told local radio. “At the very least we should not escalate the antagonism.” Ms. Lam herself has not spoken publicly since Wednesday. Yet, the prospect of postponement also stood to validate the sense of desperation among young protesters who have concluded that their leadership ignores peaceful demands for change. Convinced the alternative is to watch Beijing erode the distinctiveness and freedoms of their city, they say they see little choice. “The only way is just go to violence,” said Tony Wong, 22, a student who joined the protest Wednesday. He pointed to the yellow-vests movement in France. “You go to violence and the government will listen,” he said. At stake is stability in a major world financial hub – a stability that activists argue has been most seriously threatened by an extradition bill that could undermine the rule of law that underpins its international importance, and bring the city a step closer to integration with China’s authoritarian regime. “Hong Kong used to have this reputation as Asia’s beacon of freedom,” said Jeffrey Ngo, a historian who is chief researcher for Demosisto, a pro-democracy party. The extradition bill is “a threat to everyone.” At the same time, the prospect of chaotic protest has alarmed Hong Kong authorities, after police accused protesters of attacking them with bricks and sharpened metal sticks. “Clearly, this is no longer a peaceful assembly but a blatant, organized riot, and in no way an act of loving Hong Kong,” Ms. Lam said. Chinese state media warned that “radical opposition forces” are jeopardizing the region’s welfare. “Playing with uncontrolled street politics is to push Hong Kong to backwardness and disturbance. This is not a wise direction for Hong Kong,” China’s Global Times wrote in an editorial. Protesters and human-rights groups, meanwhile, denounced police for a gratuitous response, which included firing rubber bullets at people’s heads, an act Nathan Law, a prominent student leader, deemed “really close to murder.” More than 80 people were injured, some seriously. What took place this week “is not a good sign for Hong Kong,” said Sonny Lo, a political commentator and author. The city’s youth have become “politically alienated, socially frustrated but also strategic.” “If some of the protesters see peaceful struggle as a failure, then we may anticipate the recurrence of violent protests in the coming years.” Because, he added, “the people who protested were not only young, but they appear to believe in a kind of perpetual confrontation with the police.” But if there is confrontation, it’s not for nothing, argued Cheung Choi-wan, a translator who quit her work with Ming Pao, a Hong Kong newspaper that published an editorial calling this week’s confrontation a “riot.” “People in Hong Kong are hoping for peace for our city, but we are not willing to exchange our freedom and human rights for this so-called ‘peace,’ ” she wrote in an article explaining her decision. “The peace we want is not only peace of the flesh, but what we want even more is peace of conscience.”     Protest has been a pillar of politics in Hong Kong for at least half a century. Denied the fullness of democratic representation by the British, then provided only a limited ability to vote under Chinese rule, people in Hong Kong have long made the streets their ballot boxes. “If the government closes off every other alternative way of participating in the political process, then protests is all that’s left,” said Antony Dapiran, a lawyer and author. And history has shown that public noise often achieves its goals. “Hong Kongers have been conditioned to view protest as an effective means of forcing political change,” Mr. Dapiran writes in his book City of Protest. Over the decades, rounds of protests have brought people out to oppose transit-fare increases, protect historic landmarks, block urban redevelopment and demand democratic reforms. Hong Kong police keep detailed statistics on “public order events.” They show 12,627 public processions in the past decade – 24 a week, on average, in a city of 7.5 million. The birth of protest in the city was bloody. In 1966, after a proposed hike in ferry fares, four days of fiery riots left 26 injured and one dead. The following year, a lengthy campaign of terrorist bombings that occurred after a company owned by Li Ka-shing – now one of Hong Kong’s most prominent billionaires – said it would cut worker wages resulted in 51 deaths and 832 people injured. Police discovered more than 1,000 bombs. In the decades since, however, the defining feature of the city’s street actions has been remarkable peace. On May 21, 1989, 1.5-million people – a quarter of the city – marched to support the democracy movement then under way in China. Hundreds of thousands gather every June 4 to commemorate the Tiananmen Square crackdown in candlelight vigils so orderly that demonstrators scrape away wax drips on the asphalt. During the 2014 Umbrella Movement, students organized trash-disposal brigades. And on Sunday, in what may be the biggest protest since 1989, hundreds of thousands – perhaps more than a million – peacefully occupied three kilometres of streets to oppose the extradition bill. But that protest, too, ended in unrest, with police using batons and pepper spray to clear away demonstrators. In the hours that followed, Martin Lee, an octogenarian who is among the city’s most prominent democracy activists, was furious that late-night ugliness had marred the march. “Why would you guys be so stupid?” he recalls thinking to himself. “We had a lovely demonstration, a million people. Why ruin it at the end?” Then he read a news account about a high-school student at the march who said he was ready to sacrifice himself – even if that might mean imprisonment. “And it woke me up,” Mr. Lee said. His generation had embraced a sense of hope that Hong Kong’s liberties and uniqueness could be maintained and enhanced. And over the years, the region’s authorities have given way on a series of issues – including, in the past two decades, abandoning a draconian piece of security legislation and relenting on a bid to impose a patriotic education curriculum meant to inculcate greater youth loyalty toward China. But Mr. Lee, too, has been struck by the inability, or unwillingness, of Hong Kong’s leadership to depart from Beijing’s dictates in the past five years. It’s given him sympathy for the frustrations of the young generation. On Wednesday, he walked through the crowd of protesters, some of whom were pulling up sidewalk bricks. He urged calm. “They weren’t listening,” he said. Mr. Lee has spent his own life attempting to prevent such acts. But this week, he struggled to muster much condemnation. “They have not armed themselves with dangerous weapons. So it’s just sacrifice,” he said, adding that police were well-protected even against bricks. As for the protesters, “of course we are concerned for their safety. But these people appeared to me that they already decided that to not follow us in our peaceful ways may bring some good result. May. But following us, won’t.”     Early Thursday afternoon, barely 24 hours after he joined crowds chanting “withdraw,” Avery Ng arrived at the High Court in Hong Kong, dressed in a slim-fitting navy jacket and jeans. The chairman of the League of Social Democrats, a radical party, he did not carry a bag. He knew he might not be going home. “Tonight I may be free or I may be in jail,” he said in an interview before walking to the court, where he would learn whether his appeal of a four-month sentence – imposed after he was accused of disclosing details of a corruption investigation – would be accepted. He had already made the preparations, setting aside some reading material, including Nineteen Eighty-Four, which he was keen to reread. China, he said, could easily be substituted for George Orwell’s fictional Oceania. He grinned as he spoke over tea, betraying no sign of anxiety. “Because it is not uncommon for us to go to jail any more,” he said. In some ways, the path to this place began in 2012, when the Hong Kong government attempted to obligate local schools to use a moral and national educational curriculum. Critics warned it would amount to brainwashing, an attempt to instill in young minds a loyalty to Beijing, in much the same way schools in China use a patriotic curriculum as a tool to further communist rule. Opposition sprang up from an unexpected place, led in part by a 15-year-old student, Joshua Wong, with a group called Scholarism that helped to marshal an outpouring of protest. For 10 days, tens of thousands gathered around the legislature, until then-chief executive C.Y. Leung backed down, saying schools would not be required to use the curriculum. “Our occupation of the government headquarters ends now,” Mr. Wong said that day, in September, 2012. “But our fight against it will go on and on.” But only two months after the students declared victory in 2012, Xi Jinping became General Secretary of the Communist Party, making him China’s paramount leader. Mr. Xi has overseen a dramatic shift in Chinese policy, which has been marked by an intolerance toward internal dissent, an increasingly assertive foreign policy and, in Hong Kong, a hardening official position toward the demands of a generation of young protesters. Beijing, according to a white paper released in 2014, asserts “overall jurisdiction” over the region, granting Hong Kong “the power to run local affairs as authorized by the central leadership.” Two years later, Beijing refused demands from the Umbrella Movement to provide people in Hong Kong the right to select their own chief executive. When a group of student leaders then decided to run for office, some were declared ineligible because they were too young. Others who won election were booted from office, some because they were found to be insincere in swearing oaths of office. Authorities subsequently began legal prosecutions against pro-democracy leaders, accusing many of participating in violent actions. By the beginning of this week, 17 had been jailed, including Joshua Wong, who is currently serving a third prison sentence. For young activists, one of the major questions in the past half-decade has been “do we work within the system or do we denounce the system as illegitimate and work outside of it?” said Kong Tsung-gan, author of As Long as There Is Resistance, There Is Hope, which examines the struggles of young activists. The fact that so many people entered politics suggested a desire to work inside formal channels. The disqualifications and prison terms have placed that into question. “In a way, the government made the decision for them – that is, we will not allow you in the formal political system,” Mr. Kong said. “And that effectively disenfranchised a significant portion of the Hong Kong population overall – and a very large portion of the Hong Kong young people who are already incredibly disaffected.” On Thursday, the court rejected Mr. Ng’s appeal. He spent the night behind bars.     Peering out from behind the masks and protective glasses on the streets of Hong Kong this week was a sea of young faces, teenagers and recent university graduates who are members of the handover generation, people born after July 1, 1997, the day the former British colony came under Chinese control. They have only known Beijing as the city’s master, and they have grown up in a place increasingly oriented toward the mainland. Some 70 per cent of Hong Kong schools now teach Mandarin rather than the Cantonese that is the home language for many in the city. More than half of Hong Kong’s trade is with mainland China, up from 9.3 per cent in 1978. For those growing up in Hong Kong today, it is increasingly difficult to imagine future professional success without China. Yet, if Beijing was expecting familiarity or economic necessity to breed affection, it miscalculated. Take Stanley King, 19, a Canadian citizen who completed two years of high school in Kelowna, B.C., and another two in China’s northeastern city of Dalian. His time there fostered in him an affection for people in China. But it confirmed a very different set of views on the Chinese government. In Dalian, he recalled submitting a history paper on the Tiananmen Square massacre that his teacher would not accept. Another time, he asked his fellow students about Tiananmen. “They said, ‘That really happened? I heard nobody died,’ ” Mr. King recalled. “One said it was all the students’ fault. I was so shocked. How can you say that?” “It’s true that China has made a lot of economic advancement,” he added. “But that hasn’t changed our mind in going against the Chinese government.” China, he said, is “too restrictive. They try to control everything, including their media, their education system. There’s no freedom.” Polling by Hong Kong University has found that people in the region most strongly identify as “Hong Kongers,” while the “feeling of being ‘citizens of the PRC’ is the weakest among all identities tested,” according to the most recent results, from December. The PRC is the People’s Republic of China – and identification as Chinese citizens is far lower among young people, some of whom have come to identify with characters in Hollywood struggles. Some compare Beijing to the totalitarian regime in The Hunger Games. Others see themselves as locked in an “endgame” against an occupying villain. “Hong Kong is a well-developed country. But the Chinese government wants to take over all we have,” said Kobe Ho, 23. His instinctive description of Hong Kong as a “country” is the sort of language that frightens Beijing – as are the examples he cites as inspiration for those seeking their own democratic representation. “In South Korea, they suffered lots of years to protest,” he said, as he watched other young men in masks and helmets use zip ties to fasten together barricades. It took “lots of death so they could succeed.” He describes a battle against creeping Chinese influence in similar terms. “This is a very serious problem for Hong Kong people. We will be part of China. We will lose all of our freedom,” he said. Yet in the aftermath of the clashes this week, new calls for calm also emerged. A handwritten sign affixed to barricades still in place near the legislature urged people to register for coming elections. “Blood debts must be repaid with votes,” it said. Alternatives exist to passive protest that don’t involve use of force, said Denise Ho, a Canadian-Hong Kong pop star who has become a prominent activist in the city. “Because the police are waiting for the moment when it gets violent, so they can use their violence on us,” she said. There are “many other flexible and smarter ways to do it,” she said. “And that’s what people are learning now.” She pointed to Wednesday’s protests, which were aided by drivers who staged accidents to block traffic, clearing roads for the demonstration to take place. The protesters themselves organized without leadership, relying instead on groups in the Telegram chat app – one of which boasts nearly 60,000 members – to exchange plans and ideas. In the days since, activists have staged roving protests, including at a subway stop on Friday. “This is not a one-day fight,” Ms. Ho said. “The Hong Kong government cannot control something like this if it happens every day, and if it’s moving and fluid. They don’t have the skill set to suppress this.” She sees little cause for pessimism. “We might be impatient and we might be disappointed or frustrated,” she said. “But I don’t think that Hong Kong is near its death any time in the near future. In fact, it’s coming back very strong. I call this the comeback of Hong Kong.”  Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day’s most important headlines.

The instant the flaming device bounces onto the asphalt, they race into action – eight people bearing umbrellas and bottles, squirting water. Within four seconds, the smoke has been doused, and the impromptu extinguishment brigade dashes off to the next device. Seconds later that one, too, has been tossed off the highway overpass. The smoke has been cleared from the road, at least until the next volley. I captured video of this brief scene – only 16 seconds in length – just before 6 p.m. on Wednesday, near the end of a concerted police effort to clear protesters from streets surrounding Hong Kong’s Legislative Council. It was in many ways an unremarkable moment in a remarkable day, with police aiming rubber bullets at unarmed students in a violent conflagration that left more than 80 in hospital. Some of the most dramatic images of the day showed a mother beseeching men in riot gear not to attack, a protester in a yellow rain slicker standing up against water cannons, umbrella-bearing young people silhouetted against clouds of tear gas and a foreign journalist yelling to police: “This is still Hong Kong, not China. Not yet!” Yet the 16-second video of the extinguishment brigade came to define the protest for some on social media. It has been viewed nearly three million times on Twitter, and retweeted by people in France, Turkey, Thailand, Spain, the Philippines, Japan, Haiti, Honduras, Poland, Indonesia, Senegal and Sudan, among others. “If there is ever a video to give you hope for civil disobedience, then this is it…!” wrote one person. “Brave young men and women, they are the future of Hong Kong,” wrote another. “Thanks guys,” responded Jordan Chan, 24, who was part of the protest Wednesday. “We are really fighting hard here. Even being significantly out-geared by the police, people are still trying,” he wrote on Twitter. That fight included smothering tear-gas devices with cloths, placing the smoking canisters under helmets and traffic cones – and helping those affected. Strangers poured water into each other’s eyes to cleanse the chemicals. For Mr. Chan, “this video captures how the Hong Kongers have really grown up and learned. We have changed from being afraid of the slightest bit of suppression to bravely handling the situation,” he said. In mainland China, authorities have sought to censor all mention of the protests. Still, for some from China, the sight of people successfully quelling the power of the state – even as they ran from it – offered a sense of hope. It’s a “picture of Hong Kongers, especially young guys in Hong Kong, fighting against the extradition bill,” said Shane Yue, a former Chinese journalist now living abroad. “They are brave, they have intelligence and patience, and they are working together.” Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day’s most important headlines.

"330"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-us-companies-adapting-to-ongoing-china-tariffs/"|"Chris Prentice"|"U.S. manufacturers are accelerating their shift out of China, coming to terms with a new reality: The Trump administration’s tariffs will not go away any time soon. U.S. President Donald Trump’s lead trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, warned lawmakers on Wednesday that the United States would need to keep the threat of stiff tariffs on China in place for years, even if a trade deal is signed, as part of an enforcement mechanism that would include frequent reviews of whether China was abiding by any agreement. That confirms what many companies have already concluded. Even if the hot phase of this trade war passes, tensions will linger and continue to reshape the economic relationship between the world’s two largest economies. “As you look at the way these negotiations are shaping up, you must certainly think: Not only will it take a while for the talks to reach their full conclusion, but there’s going to be enforcement mechanisms,” said Steve Lamar, executive vice-president of the American Apparel and Footwear Association. “I would imagine punitive tariffs are going to be with us for a while.” Apparel and footwear manufacturers have been shifting their production mix to factories in other countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia and Egypt for much of the past decade, but the push has intensified because of the trade war, Mr. Lamar said. The United States has not hit most finished apparel and footwear with punitive tariffs, but “even if the threat [of more tariffs] never materializes and it’s always out there, who wants to live with that threat?” he said. It will take years, however, for large manufacturers and retailers to build new supply networks. Many companies have held off raising prices to offset tariffs, in hopes that they would go away. As it becomes clear that the risk of tariffs will linger, more companies are taking steps to mitigate them and accepting trade conflict with China as a new fact of life, according to businesses and trade groups interviewed by Reuters. One company already moving some production out of China is Bissell Inc., the vacuum maker. Chief executive officer Mark Bissell said long before tariffs, he was looking for alternatives due to rising costs in China. Tariffs, he said, are the “burning platform” forcing him to jump. Mr. Bissell expects to have some of the company’s China production shifted to Vietnam, Malaysia and Mexico by the end of the year, and said Mr. Lighthizer’s comments confirm what he was already doing. “The geopolitical issues between the two countries will continue to be large and with so much at stake, the relationship will be touchy going forward,” Mr. Bissell said in an e-mail.“ Diversifying the supply chain makes continued sense and I don’t see a reversal of course.” Jacob Parker, vice-president of China operations at the U.S.-China Business Council in Beijing, said even in the event of a trade deal, it was possible the persistent threat of tariffs would continue to push U.S. companies’ supply chains out of the country. Similarly, Chinese firms are likely reconsidering their reliance on U.S. companies, he said. It remains unclear whether the United States will prevail in its trade war against China. Mr. Lighthizer, testifying to the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee, said a great deal of work remains to hammer out a deal, including agreeing on how it would be enforced. Many companies are stuck in a wait-and-see mode, but the realization that there will not be a quick fix is growing. “The longer it goes on, the more likely [the China trade battle] becomes more permanent,” said Todd Stucke, senior vice-president of marketing, product support and strategic projects at Kubota Tractor Corp., the U.S. arm of Japanese tractor maker Kubota Corp. “I’m hoping it doesn’t.” Shifting supply chains is no small task for companies that have spent years investing in countries such as China, said the apparel and footwear group’s Mr. Lamar. On Thursday, shoemaker Crocs Inc. highlighted the threat of the Trump administration’s trade policy changes, especially the tariffs. “It may be time-consuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to or comply with any such changes,” the company said. Some companies are resorting to the price hikes they have been delaying. Kubota held off raising prices until now in hopes that the costs associated with tariffs – including higher prices for imported parts from China – would be short-lived. Kubota has 10 U.S. factories, with seven in Kansas. Its business has been hammered by retaliatory tariffs on U.S. farmers, Mr. Stucke said. “We held out as long as we could,” he said. The company is implementing across-the-board price increases of 1 per cent to 5 per cent, depending on the item, as of Friday.

"331"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-iran-rejects-us-accusations-as-part-of-sabotage-diplomacy/"|"Parisa Hafezi Makini Brice"|"The United States on Friday blamed Iran for attacks on two oil tankers at the entrance to the Gulf and said it was seeking international consensus about the threat to shipping, despite Tehran denying involvement in the explosions at sea. Thursday’s attacks raised fears of a confrontation in the vital oil shipping route at a time of increased tension between Iran and the United States over U.S. sanctions and military moves in the Middle East, Tehran’s proxy groups in the region and its nuclear programme. “Iran did do it and you know they did it because you saw the boat,” U.S. President Donald Trump told Fox News. He was referring to a video released on Thursday by the U.S. military which said it showed Iran’s Revolutionary Guards were behind the blasts that struck the Norwegian-owned Front Altair and the Japanese-owned Kokuka Courageous in the Gulf of Oman, at the mouth of the Gulf. Iran said the video proved nothing and that it was being made into a scapegoat. “These accusations are alarming,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said. Iran has dismissed earlier U.S. charges that it was behind the attacks and has accused the United States and its regional allies such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates of “warmongering” by making accusations against it. Last month, the United States sharply tightened economic sanctions that are damaging the economy of Iran, which in response has threatened to step up its nuclear activity. Tehran has said it could block the Strait of Hormuz, the main route out for Middle Eastern oil, if its own exports were halted. Trump, who last year pulled the United States out of an agreement between world powers and Tehran to curb Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for some sanctions relief, said any move to close the Strait of Hormuz would not last long but added that he was open to negotiations with Iran. Iran has repeatedly said it will not re-enter talks with the United States unless it reverses Trump’s decision to withdraw from the 2015 nuclear deal. Tehran and Washington have both said they have no interest in starting a war. But this has done little to assuage concerns that the two arch foes could stumble into a conflict. A U.S. official told Reuters on Friday a surface-to-air missile was fired from Iranian territory on Thursday morning at a U.S. drone that was near Front Altair following the attack on the tanker. The missile did not hit the drone, the official said. Trump’s administration is focused on building international consensus following the attacks, U.S. Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan said. Asked whether he was considering sending more troops or military capabilities to the Middle East, Shanahan said: “As you know we’re always planning various contingencies.” But he emphasized the issue of building consensus. “When you look at the situation, a Norwegian ship, a Japanese ship, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, 15 percent of the world’s oil flows through the Strait of Hormuz,” he said. “So we obviously need to make contingency plans should the situation deteriorate. We also need to broaden our support for this international situation,” he told reporters. Oil prices rose about 1% on Friday, reflecting the jitters. Insurance costs for ships sailing through the Middle East have jumped by at least 10% after the attacks, ship insurers said. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for an independent investigation of the attacks. The tanker attacks took place while Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan - a big buyer of Iranian oil until it was forced by the new U.S. sanctions to stop - was visiting Tehran on a peacemaking mission, bringing a message from Trump. Iran dismissed Trump’s message, details of which were not made public. “I do not see Trump as worthy of any message exchange, and I do not have any reply for him, now or in future,” Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said. Washington has also blamed Iran or its proxies for attacks on May 12 that crippled four oil tankers in the same area, and has said Tehran was behind May 14 drone strikes on two Saudi oil-pumping stations. Tehran has denied all those charges. The U.S. military said black-and-white footage it filmed from a U.S. aircraft showed Iran’s Guards on a patrol boat drawing up to the Kokuka Courageous and removing an unexploded limpet mine from its hull. The Japanese-owned tanker, abandoned by its crew, was being towed to a port in the United Arab Emirates on Friday, after a Dutch firm said it had been appointed to salvage the ships. The second tanker, the Front Altair, which was set ablaze by a blast, was still languishing at sea, although the fire that had charred the hull had been put out. Iranian military fast-boats in the Gulf of Oman were preventing two privately owned tug boats from towing away the Front Altair, a U.S. official said on Friday. China, the European Union and others have called for restraint from all sides. In a notable signal that close U.S. allies are wary of Washington’s position, Germany said the U.S. video was not enough to apportion blame for Thursday’s attack. But British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt differed, saying no other state or non-state actor could have been responsible. Last month Washington scrapped waivers that had allowed some countries to continue importing Iranian oil, effectively ordering all countries to blacklist Iran or face sanctions themselves. Iran’s crude exports fell to about 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) in May, starving Iran’s economy of its main source of revenue. Iran says it is still abiding by the terms of the nuclear deal, but cannot do so indefinitely unless it receives some of the economic benefits that were promised. There have been conflicting accounts of the cause of Thursday’s blasts. An initial report that Kokuka Courageous was struck by a torpedo was dismissed by a source familiar with the issue. The owner of the tanker, which carried methanol, later said it was hit by two “flying objects”. Iranian TV showed 23 crew in Iran believed to be from Front Altair on Friday, and said its experts would assess whether they could return to the ship. The crew from Kokuka Courageous were picked up and handed to a U.S. Navy ship on Thursday.

The hearings beginning Monday will end on June 25, the USTR said in a statement on Friday. That timeline means Trump would not be able to trigger the fresh wave of tariffs until after July 2, when a seven-day final rebuttal comment period ends. U.S.-China relations have deteriorated since Trump accused Beijing in early May of reneging on commitments to change its ways of doing business with the rest of the world. Since then, Trump raised tariffs to 25 per cent on $200 billion of Chinese goods and ordered his trade representative to prepare tariffs on another $300 billion, effectively covering almost all Chinese exports to the United States. Trump has said he wants to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping during June 28-29 G20 leaders summit in Japan, but neither government has confirmed a meeting. The proposed tariffs on another $300 billion are a further “response to China’s unfair trade practices related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation,” USTR said in its statement Friday. The tariffs will hit consumer goods hard, including cellphones, laptop computers, toys, video game consoles, television sets, clothing and footwear. The list of more than 300 scheduled witnesses includes representatives from retailer Best Buy, toy maker Hasbro Inc vacuum cleaner maker iRobot, faucet maker Moen and other firms and trade groups in a diverse range of industries.

"333"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-hong-kongs-controversial-extradition-bill-may-be-suspended-reports/"|""|"Hong Kong media reported on Saturday the city’s government would suspend a proposed law on extradition to mainland China that sparked widespread anger and violent protests, with leader Carrie Lam planning to address reporters later in the day. Cracks began to appear on Friday in the support base for the extradition bill with several pro-Beijing politicians and a senior advisor to Lam saying discussion of the bill should be shelved for the time being. The extradition bill, which will cover Hong Kong’s 7 million residents and foreign and Chinese nationals living or travelling in the city, has many concerned it may threaten the rule of law that underpins Hong Kong’s international financial status. Around a million people, according to protest organisers, marched through Hong Kong last Sunday to oppose the bill. Protests that continued through the week were met with tear gas, bean bag rounds and rubber bullets from police, plunging the city into turmoil and piling heavy pressure on Lam. Another protest march is planned for this Sunday. Hong Kong news outlets including iCable, the South China Morning Post and Sing Tao newspaper reported that the bill would be suspended on Saturday. A statement from the government said Lam would address the media at 3 p.m. (0700 GMT) on Saturday. It gave no further details. Lam has not appeared in public or commented since Wednesday. Hong Kong media reported Lam was meeting pro-Beijing lawmakers around noon to explain her pending announcement. Backing down from efforts to drive the bill through the city’s legislature by July would have been unthinkable last week when the law’s passage seemed inevitable as Lam remained defiant. Beyond the public outcry, the extradition bill had spooked some of Hong Kong’s tycoons into starting to move their personal wealth offshore, according to financial advisers, bankers and lawyers familiar with the details. And senior police officers have said Lam’s refusal to heed public opinion was sowing resentment in the force, which was already battered by accusations of police brutality during the 2014 pro-democracy “Umbrella” civil disobedience movement. Michael Tien, a member of Hong Kong’s legislature and a deputy to China’s national parliament, said a total withdrawal of the bill was unlikely. “The amendment is supported by the central government, so I think a withdrawal would send a political message that the central government is wrong. This would not happen under ‘one country, two systems’,” he told Reuters, referring to the model under which Hong Kong enjoys semi-autonomy. Tien, a member of the pro-Beijing camp, said he supported a suspension of the bill without a timetable. Despite chatter that the government would hit pause on the bill, organisers of last Sunday’s protest march stood by plans for another march this Sunday. In addition to opposing the bill they would also be calling for accountability of the police for the way protests have been handled. Lam has said the extradition law is necessary to prevent criminals using Hong Kong as a place to hide and that human rights will be protected by the city’s court which will decide on the extraditions on a case-by-case basis. Critics, including leading lawyers and rights groups, note that China’s justice system is controlled by the Communist Party, and marked by torture and forced confessions, arbitrary detention and poor access to lawyers. Last Sunday’s protest in the former British colony was the biggest political demonstration since its return to Chinese rule in 1997 under the “one country, two systems” deal. The agreement guarantees Hong Kong’s special autonomy, including freedom of assembly, free press and independent judiciary. Many accuse China of extensive meddling since then, including obstruction of democratic reforms, interference with elections and of being behind the disappearance of five Hong Kong-based booksellers, starting in 2015, who specialised in works critical of Chinese leaders. Beijing has denied that it has overreached in Hong Kong.

Environment and energy ministers of the G20 major economies met this weekend in Karuizawa, northwest of Tokyo, ahead of the G20 summit in Osaka, western Japan, on June 28-29. One of the top issues was ocean plastic waste as images of plastic debris-strewn beaches and dead animals with stomachs full of plastic have sparked outrage, with many countries banning plastic bags outright. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said he wants his country to lead the world in reducing marine plastic trash, including developing biodegradables and other innovations. The new framework is aimed at facilitating further concrete action on marine waste, though on a voluntary basis, after the G20 Hamburg Summit in Germany adopted the “G20 action plan on marine litter” in 2017. Under the new framework, G20 members will promote a comprehensive life-cycle approach to prevent and reduce plastic litter discharge to the oceans through various measures and international co-operation. They will also share best practices, promote innovation and boost scientific monitoring and analytical methodologies. “I’m glad that we, including emerging countries and developing countries, were able to form a broad international framework,” Yoshiaki Harada, Japan’s environment minister, told a news conference. Japan plans to host the first meeting under the new framework this fall when officials of environment ministers in the G20 countries are due to meet for the G20 Resource Efficiency Dialogue.

"336"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-saudi-arabias-crown-prince-accuses-rival-iran-of-tanker-attacks/"|"Aya Batrawy"|"Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman said in remarks published Sunday that the kingdom will not hesitate to confront Iranian threats to its security. He joined the United States in accusing its bitter rival Iran of being behind the attacks on two oil tankers travelling near the Strait of Hormuz, a vital trade route for Arabian energy exports. Tensions in the Persian Gulf have escalated since the United States sent an aircraft carrier strike group and other military assets to the region in what it says is defensive posturing against alleged Iranian threats. The crisis takes root in the Trump Administration’s decision to reimpose punishing economic sanctions on Tehran and its oil exports, after unilaterally withdrawing the United States from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers. The United States alleges Iran used limpet mines to target the tankers on Thursday, pointing to black-and-white footage it captured that U.S. officials describe as an Iranian Revolutionary Guard vessel removing an unexploded mine from the Japanese-operated tanker Kokuka Courageous. The Japanese tanker’s crew members appeared to contradict the assertion that mines were used. They described “flying objects” as having targeted the vessel. In his first public comments regarding the attacks, the powerful Saudi Crown Prince, who is also Defence Minister and oversees all major levers of power in the country, said the incident “confirms the importance of our demands of the international community to take a decisive stance” against Iran’s behaviour. “The kingdom does not seek war in the region,” the Crown Prince said, speaking with the Arabic-language newspaper Asharq al-Awsat. “But we will not hesitate to deal with any threat to our people, sovereignty and vital interests.” The Crown Prince claimed Iran had planned the attack’s timing to undercut the Japanese prime minister’s diplomatic efforts, during his visit to Tehran last week, to reduce regional tensions. He did not offer any evidence to back up the allegation. “The problem is in Tehran and not anywhere else,” he added. “Iran is always the party that’s escalating in the region, carrying out terrorist attacks and criminal attacks either directly or through its militias.” Crown Prince bin Salman touted U.S.-Saudi relations as “essential to achieving regional security and stability.” Speaking on “Fox News Sunday,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reiterated the official U.S. position. He claimed that intelligence officials have “lots of data, lots of evidence” tying Iran to the attacks, although he did not provide any specifics. He called the alleged shipping attacks “an international challenge, important to the entire globe.” He said U.S. President Donald Trump was following an “economic pressure campaign” against Iran but “we do not want war.” He added that the “unambiguous” object of U.S. actions was that Iran would not get nuclear weapons. Iran rejects accusations it was responsible for Thursday’s attacks, saying it stands ready to play an active and constructive role in ensuring the security of maritime passages. It said the massive U.S. military presence in the region and U.S. sanctions are the main sources of insecurity and instability in the Persian Gulf. Thursday’s incidents forced the evacuation of all 44 sailors aboard the two vessels. On Saturday, Associated Press journalists saw the crew members of the Norwegian-owned oil tanker MT Front Altair arrive at Dubai International Airport, after spending two days in Iran. The Front Altair, which caught fire after the apparent attack, limped into anchorage Sunday off the eastern coast of the United Arab Emirates, near the port city of Khorfakkan. Similar to the recent attacks, four oil tankers off the coast of the United Arab Emirates were apparently targeted in acts of sabotage last month, which U.S. officials have also blamed on Iran. Two of those vessels belonged to Saudi Arabia. Iranian-allied Yemeni rebels, known as Houthis, have also claimed they were behind a missile strike on a Saudi airport in the city of Abha that the kingdom said wounded 26 passengers. The Houthis also carried out a drone strike last month on a key Saudi oil pipeline Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day’s most important headlines.

"337"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-with-white-flowers-vast-crowds-in-hong-kong-commemorate-a-death-and/"|"Nathan VanderKlippe"|"As protest movements have swept Hong Kong in recent years, simple icons have come to define the complexity of immense crowds and their sometimes complicated demands. In 2014, the umbrella, a frail but effective shield against rain and tear gas alike, represented a movement demanding greater democratic representation that occupied streets for three months. On June 4, the flickering flame of a candle illuminates the still-burning memories of the Tiananmen crackdown during annual vigils. And on Sunday, white flowers − chrysanthemums, lilies, daisies − became the icon of the latest march on Hong Kong streets, as many in a gathering of people believed to be the largest in the city’s history clutched floral remembrances of a 35-year-old man, surnamed Leung, who fell to his death Saturday night, after he staged a protest against a proposed extradition bill. One senior leader in the city said the bill is now effectively dead. Mr. Leung had stood for hours atop construction scaffolding beside a sign that said “Make love No shoot! No Extradition to China.” Police ruled it a suicide. But to those bearing flowers, Mr. Leung had become a martyr for a swelling movement against the bill, which critics say represents the rising encroachment of mainland China and threatens the protection of civil liberties. Public fury has thrust Hong Kong’s top political leader, the Beijing-appointed chief executive Carrie Lam, into a deep crisis. On Sunday night, she apologized, with a government spokesperson saying in a statement she “admitted that the deficiencies in the government’s work had led to substantial controversies and disputes in society, causing disappointment and grief among the people.” Work on the bill has stopped and “there is no timetable for restarting the process,” the statement said. Chinese authorities offered their “firm support” for Ms. Lam through a commentary published Sunday in the People’s Daily, a central Communist Party mouthpiece. The bill is now “essentially a dead case,” Bernard Chan, a senior adviser to Ms. Lam, told Bloomberg Monday morning, with “no chance” it will be reintroduced before legislative elections next year. The legislation would ease the ability of Chinese authorities to extradite from Hong Kong people they accuse of serious crimes. It has raised widespread worry that it could be used to force the city’s dissidents to face justice in Chinese courts on trumped-up charges. On Saturday, Ms. Lam said she would delay the bill’s consideration, pending further consultation, after protests broke out last week. She said at the time that she hoped to prevent further “chaos” in Hong Kong. But demonstrators on Sunday, in an afternoon march that organizers estimated at nearly two million people − almost double that of a week ago − chanted for her to resign, with thousands remaining gathered around the Legislative Council through the night. Police, who maintained a minimal presence after clashes with protesters last week, estimated the peaceful Sunday march at 338,000, 40 per cent larger than last week. The figure from organizers, if accurate, would mean more than a quarter of the city took to the streets on Sunday. Many said they rejected Ms. Lam’s apology as inadequate. “This seems to be about more than simply the extradition law, which must now surely be completely dead in the water. This is a rejection of Carrie Lam, her administration and the way Hong Kong has been ruled − and a very emotional expression of Hong Kongers’ desire to retain their own unique identity,” said Antony Dapiran, a Hong Kong lawyer and author of City of Protest: A Recent History of Dissent in Hong Kong. Indeed, the death of Mr. Leung on Saturday night crystallized what some consider a mortal struggle against Beijing’s influence in a city that was handed over to Chinese control in 1997, but which has come to be perhaps the world’s foremost source of resistance to China’s authoritarianism. In his death, Mr. Leung has “enlightened people that what they are fighting for is not only this regulation. It’s Hong Kong itself,” said Cheng Chung Tai, a pro-democracy member of the region’s Legislative Council. His voice cracked as he spoke, standing beside a growing pile of flowers at the site where Mr. Leung died. Smoke curled into the air from incense sticks. One sign said: “To you, the person who is now in heaven: let us give voice to the message that you could not.” “Everyone believes he sacrificed for Hong Kong’s freedom,” said Cherrie Hui, 26, a recruitment consultant. Mr. Leung “is representing our generation,” said Heinrich Man, 25, an insurance actuary. Eric Tse, 42, came with his wife and son and daughter, eight and ten, who stood outside for hours in the heat of a slow-moving march. He wanted to give his children a taste of political participation. A banker, he came with dozens of friends, some of whom took to the streets Sunday for the first time in their lives. “I believe this is the right thing I need to do as Hong Kong people,” he said. So many people bought white flowers that nearby florists sold out entirely, leading others to buy yellow sunflowers and blue Chinese bellflowers. Others made their own, folding tissue into white blooms. Still others carried a printed sign with an image of a single white rose rising out of a spatter of crimson blood. It read: “No China Extradition No Police Brutality.” The sign was designed by Gary Fan, another pro-democracy member of the Legislative Council, who created it two days before the death of Mr. Leung. He printed out 15,000 copies that were held aloft in the jammed streets Sunday. The design was initially created to commemorate those injured in Wednesday clashes between protesters who hurled water bottles and bricks at police, who responded by firing pepper balls, rubber bullets and tear gas. On Sunday, protesters also called for the release of young people arrested after the Wednesday unrest, which authorities termed a “riot.” Critics have faulted police, who fired some 150 tear-gas devices, for excessive use of force. On Sunday, they demanded authorities rescind their characterization of the gathering as a riot, and said they want officers who attacked protesters to be held responsible. Crowds of young people gathered Sunday night at the fence surrounding the region’s legislative complex to hurl profane insults at police inside. “Because of the police brutality, Hong Kong citizens shed their blood for the purpose of fighting against this evil bill, the China extradition bill,” Mr. Fan said.

After a week of demonstrations involving tear gas, rubber bullets and the death of one 35-year-old protester, Hong Kong’s top leader, Carrie Lam, has indefinitely delayed the bill. Now, as Chinese authorities reconsider their approach to Hong Kong following the stunning retreat, activists and observers say what has happened in this place on the edge of China may embolden others to respond to Beijing’s bid to expand its influence.

"339"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-vatican-formally-opens-debate-on-married-priests-in-remote-parts-of/"|"Nicole Winfield"|"The Vatican formally opened debate Monday on letting married men be ordained as priests in remote parts of the Amazon where priests are so few that Catholics can go weeks or months without attending a Mass. The call for study on the proposal was contained in the working document, released Monday, for an October meeting of South American bishops on the Amazon. The document, prepared by the Vatican based on input from the region, affirmed that celibacy is a gift for the Catholic Church. But it suggested officials study “the possibility of priestly ordination for older men, preferably indigenous and respected and accepted by their communities, even if they have stable families, for the region’s most remote areas.” The idea of ordaining so-called “viri probati” – married men of proven virtue – has been around for decades to cope with a priest shortage and decline in vocations overall. But it has drawn fresh attention under Pope Francis, history’s first Latin American pope, thanks to his familiarity with the challenges facing the Amazon church. The Oct. 6-27 meeting on the sacramental and environmental needs of the Amazon will draw bishops from Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela. Brazil’s bishops have long pushed for the church to consider ordaining viri probati to minister in remote parts of the Amazon where by some estimates there is one priest for every 10,000 Catholics. The celibacy question has been a mainstay in Catholic debate given it is a discipline, not a doctrine, and therefore can change. The church has had the tradition since the 11th century, imposed in part to spare the church the financial burdens of providing for large families and to ensure that any assets of the priest would pass to the church, not his heirs. Proponents of a relaxation of the rule say more men would consider a vocation to the priesthood if they could marry, a surefire fix to the decline in priests globally. Opponents say relaxing the rule for the Amazon will certainly fuel calls for it to be relaxed elsewhere. Already, married men can be ordained in the Eastern rite Catholic Church and married men who convert from Protestant churches can be Catholic priests. In addition to ordaining married men, the document called for the synod to identify “the type of official ministry that can be conferred on women.” It said women, who already play important roles in indigenous communities, must be guaranteed leadership roles. But it stopped short of recommending debate on whether women could be ordained as deacons. One of the organizers, Monsignor Fabio Fabene, said the female diaconate was essentially off the table since Francis has recently determined that the issue needs further discussion. Overall, the synod bishops are expected to debate a host of measures to better minister to indigenous and migrant communities in the Amazon amid deforestation and exploitative industries and competition for souls from Pentecostal churches, which are more present in the region with indigenous, local leaders. The Vatican’s working document acknowledged this competition, saying the Catholic Church must transition from being a church that merely visits vast regions to one that has a full-time presence with ministries, liturgies, sacraments and social services. It called for a church that has a more indigenous face, with local songs, dance, costumes and the Bible translated into various languages. What is needed, it said, is to essentially recover aspects of the primitive Christian church.

Kenya’s Health Minister Sicily Kariuki Monday announced that a patient isolated at the Kericho County Referral Hospital does not have Ebola. “The results of tests carried out by the Kenya Medical Research Institute laboratories on the 36-year-old lady currently admitted in the isolation unit of the Kericho County Referral hospital have been confirmed to be negative for the Ebola virus disease and other hemorrhagic fevers,” Kariuki said in a statement. The woman showed some symptoms of Ebola after travelling from Malaba on the Kenya-Uganda border, sparking fears that Congo’s current outbreak had spread to Kenya. The outbreak in eastern Congo has killed more than 1,400 people since August and last week it spread to neighbouring Uganda where two people died. Kenya’s health minister had earlier given assurances that all appropriate measures had been taken to prevent the spread of Ebola. “Precautionary measures have been put in place including isolation of the patient,” said Kariuki, while touring the Nairobi international airport to see how arriving passengers are screened for symptoms of fever. The two victims in Uganda were part of a Congolese-Ugandan family who are believed to have contracted the disease at a funeral in Congo that was attended by dozens of people. An expert committee of the World Health Organization on Friday said Congo’s Ebola outbreak is an “extraordinary event” of deep concern but does not yet merit being declared a global emergency. Speaking in Kampala, the Ugandan capital, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Monday that he accepted the decision. “From our side, I would like to pledge that we will continue mobilizing global and regional support to control this outbreak as soon as possible. It is not clean until the outbreak in (Congo) is finished,” he said, according to a statement from Uganda’s health ministry. The spread of Ebola in eastern Congo has been “very unpredictable, with up and down trends,” he said. In eastern Congo, health officials have begun offering vaccinations to all residents in the hotspot of Mabalako whereas previous efforts had only targeted known contacts or those considered to be at high risk.

"341"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-fashion-icon-socialite-gloria-vanderbilt-dies-at-95/"|"Ula Ilnytzky"|"Gloria Vanderbilt, the intrepid heiress, artist and romantic who began her extraordinary life as the “poor little rich girl” of the Great Depression, survived family tragedy and multiple marriages and reigned during the 1970s and ’80s as a designer-jeans pioneer, died on Monday at the age of 95. Ms. Vanderbilt was the great-great-granddaughter of financier Cornelius Vanderbilt and the mother of CNN newsman Anderson Cooper, who announced her death via a first-person obituary that aired on the network Monday morning. Mr. Cooper said Ms. Vanderbilt died at home with friends and family at her side. She had been suffering from advanced stomach cancer, he noted. “Gloria Vanderbilt was an extraordinary woman, who loved life, and lived it on her own terms,” Mr. Cooper said in a statement. “She was a painter, a writer and designer, but also a remarkable mother, wife and friend. She was 95 years old, but ask anyone close to her, and they’d tell you, she was the youngest person they knew, the coolest, and most modern.” Her life was chronicled in sensational headlines from her childhood through four marriages and three divorces. She married for the first time at 17, causing her aunt to disinherit her. Her husbands included Leopold Stokowski, the celebrated conductor, and Sidney Lumet, the award-winning movie and television director. In 1988, she witnessed the suicide of one of her four sons. Tributes online came from celebrities and fans of her clothes alike. Alyssa Milano called her “an incredible woman,” Dana Delany said she treasures one of Ms. Vanderbilt’s paintings and model Carol Alt hailed her as a “fashion icon and innovator.” One Twitter user mourned by remembering the canary Vanderbilt jeans she wore in junior high school. Ms. Vanderbilt was a talented painter and collagist who also acted on the stage (The Time of Your Life on Broadway in 1955) and television (Playhouse 90, Studio One, Kraft Theater, U.S. Steel Hour). She was a fabric designer who became an early enthusiast of designer denim. The dark-haired, tall and ultrathin Ms. Vanderbilt partnered with Mohan Murjani, who introduced a US$1-million advertising campaign in 1978 that turned the Gloria Vanderbilt brand with its signature white swan label into a sensation. At its peak in 1980, it was generating more than US$200-million in sales. And decades later, famous-name designer jeans – dressed up or down – remain a woman’s wardrobe staple. Ms. Vanderbilt wrote several books, including the 2004 chronicle of her love life: It Seemed Important at the Time: A Romance Memoir, which drops such names as Errol Flynn, whom she dated as a teenager; Frank Sinatra, for whom she left Mr. Stokowski; Marlon Brando and Howard Hughes. She claimed her only happy marriage was to author Wyatt Cooper, which ended with his death in 1978 at the age of 50. Her son Anderson called her memoir “a terrific book; it’s like an older Sex and the City.“ “I’ve had many, many loves,” Ms. Vanderbilt told the Associated Press in a 2004 interview. “I always feel that something wonderful is going to happen. And it always does.” Noting her father’s death when she was a toddler, she said: “If you don’t have a father, you don’t miss it, because you don’t know what it is. It was really only when I married Wyatt Cooper that I understood what it was like to have a father, because he was just an extraordinary father.” In 2016, Ms. Vanderbilt and Anderson appeared together in the HBO documentary Nothing Left Unsaid. Gloria Laura Madeleine Sophie Vanderbilt was born in 1924, a century after her great-great-grandfather started the family fortune, first in steamships, later in railroads. He left around US$100-million when he died in 1877 at the age of 82. Her father, Reginald Claypoole Vanderbilt, was 43, a gambler and boozer dying of liver disease when he married Gloria Morgan, 19, in 1923. Their daughter was 1 when Reginald died in 1925, having gone through US$25-million in 14 years. Beneficiary of a US$5-million trust fund, Gloria became the “poor little rich girl” in 1934 at the age of 10 as the object of a custody fight between her globe-trotting mother and matriarchal aunt. The aunt, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, 59, who controlled US$78-million and founded the Whitney Museum of American Art, won custody of her niece. A shocked judge had closed the trial when a maid accused the child’s mother of a lesbian affair with a member of the British Royal Family. The fight was chronicled in the bestselling 1980 book Little Gloria … Happy at Last, made into a TV miniseries in 1982 with Angela Lansbury playing Whitney. The “poor little rich girl” nickname “bothered me enormously,” Ms. Vanderbilt told the Associated Press in a 2016 interview. “I didn’t see any of the press – the newspapers were kept from me. I didn’t know what it meant. I didn’t feel poor and I didn’t feel rich. It really did influence me enormously to make something of my life when I realized what it meant.” After spending the next seven years on her aunt’s Long Island estate, Ms. Vanderbilt went to Hollywood. She dated celebrities and declared she would marry Mr. Hughes. Instead, the 17-year-old wed Mr. Hughes’s press agent, Pasquale di Cicco, prompting her aunt to cut her out of her will. Ms. Vanderbilt came into her own US$5-million trust fund in 1945 at the age of 21. She also divorced Mr. Di Cicco, whom she said had beaten her often, and the next day married the 63-year-old Mr. Stokowski. The marriage to the conductor lasted 10 years and produced two sons, Stanislaus and Christopher. After her marriage broke up, Ms. Vanderbilt found herself embroiled in another custody case, this time as the mother. During the closed hearings, Mr. Stokowski accused Ms. Vanderbilt of spending too much time at parties and too little with the boys. She accused him of tyrannizing his sons and said he really was 85, and not 72 as he claimed. Justice Edgar Nathan Jr. gave Ms. Vanderbilt full-time custody. But he commented that the court had wasted a month on “the resolution of problems which mature, intelligent parents should be able to work out for themselves.” Ms. Vanderbilt married Mr. Lumet in 1956 and lived with him and her children in a 10-room duplex penthouse on Gracie Square in New York. She divorced Mr. Lumet and married Wyatt Cooper in 1963. Their elder son, Carter, a Princeton graduate and editor at American Heritage, killed himself in 1988 at the age of 23, leaping from his mother’s 14th-floor apartment as she tried to stop him. Police said he had been treated for depression and friends said he was despondent over a breakup with a girlfriend. Ms. Vanderbilt says in Nothing Left Unsaid that she contemplated following him out the window, but the thought of how it would devastate Anderson stopped her. After her success in designer jeans, Ms. Vanderbilt branched out into other areas, including shoes, scarves, table and bed linens and china, through her company, Gloria Concepts. In 1988, Ms. Vanderbilt joined the designer fragrance market with her signature “Glorious.” By the late 1980s, Ms. Vanderbilt sold the name and licenses for the brand name “Gloria Vanderbilt” to Gitano, who transferred it to a group of private investors in 1993. More recently, her stretch jeans have been licensed through Jones Apparel Group Inc., which acquired Gloria Vanderbilt Apparel Corp. in 2002 for US$138-million. Ms. Vanderbilt became the target of a swindle in the late 1970s and early ’80s when she made her psychiatrist and a lawyer associates in her business affairs. A court held that the two had looted millions from Ms. Vanderbilt’s bank accounts. Ms. Vanderbilt also made headlines in 1980 when she filed, but later dropped, a discrimination complaint against the posh River House apartments, which had rejected her bid to buy a US$1.1-million duplex. She claimed the board was worried that black singer Bobby Short, who appeared with her on TV commercials, might marry her. In 2009, the 85-year-old Ms. Vanderbilt penned a new novel, Obsession: An Erotic Tale, a graphic tale about an architect’s widow who discovers a cache of her husband’s letters that reveal his secret sex life. In an interview with The New York Times, she said she wasn’t embarrassed about the explicitness of her new book, saying: “I don’t think age has anything to do with what you write about. The only thing that would embarrass me is bad writing, and the only thing that really concerned me was my children. You know how children can be about their parents. But mine are very intelligent and supportive.” Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day’s most important headlines.

"342"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-sudans-protest-leaders-call-for-night-rallies-amid-standoff-with/"|"Hussein Malla Samy Magdy"|"Sudan’s protest leaders on Monday called for nighttime demonstrations and marches in the capital, Khartoum, and elsewhere in the country, amid a tense standoff with the ruling military over who should lead the transition after the ouster of the autocrat Omar al-Bashir. The protest leaders said they’ve begun a “revolutionary escalation” to pressure the country’s generals to hand over power to civilians and to condemn the military’s violent dispersal of their sit-in camp in Khartoum earlier this month. At least 128 people have died since the security force’s crackdown on June 3, according to the protest organizers. The military-backed authorities, however, say 61 people died, including three members of the security forces. The group representing the protesters – known as the Forces for the Declaration of Freedom and Change – said the night rallies will begin on Tuesday and marches on Thursday. The calls came a day after the deputy head of Sudan’s ruling military council, Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, pushed back against demands from protest leaders concerning the composition of a transitional legislative body, seen by protest leaders as their “most important victory” in talks with the military. Dura Gambo, an activist with the Sudanese Professionals Association which has spearheaded the protest movement since December, said the protest leaders chose to return to the streets after they realized that the military “started to pull out of the previous deals.” “There is a total impasse. The negotiations have been suspended, internet services remain blocked, and the Ethiopian mediations apparently did not make progress,” she said. Negotiations between the military and protesters were called off after the deadly sit-in dispersal on June 3. The FDFC announced a package of conditions to be met before resuming talks, which included the formation of an international commission to investigate the killings of protesters, restoring internet services, and adherence to any deals struck before the breakdown in talks. The military council rejected the idea of an international investigation, but the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry had said the council had agreed to adhere to the previous deals. Both Ethiopia and the U.S., which has sent a special envoy to Sudan, have made efforts to revive the talks and find a peaceful solution. In a sign of continued international pressure, the European Union on Monday called for military and protest leaders to refrain from unilateral moves, and resume negotiations “immediately,” based on agreements reached so far. The statement, issued by an EU council representing its member states, urged the military to take confidence-building measures, including lifting restrictions on freedom of assembly, freedom of the media, civic space and access to the internet, and for the FDFC to respond accordingly. Gambo warned that the protesters were still facing deadly repression as long as the feared paramilitary Rapid Support Forces and other security units were left on the streets in Khartoum and other cities. “Street demonstrations are risky. It means more crackdown and deaths,” she said. In a news conference in Khartoum on Monday, prominent activist Mohammed Naji al-Asam reiterated the demand for an internationally-backed investigation into the protesters’ deaths, before resuming talks with the military. “We are ready for any scenario. It seems that the military council intends to cling to power to rule Sudan alone,” he said. “This will not happen,” he added. He says 12 alleged rape cases were documented in the crackdown. He did not elaborate. Last week, Pramila Patten, a U.N. special representative on sexual violence in conflict zones, expressed “grave concern” over reports of the rapes of protesters and female medical personnel by security forces and militias in Sudan. Over the weekend, the hashtag #blueforSudan began to trend locally and internationally on social media, as a sign of solidarity with Sudan’s embattled protest movement. Gambo, the activist, said the hashtag was created in memory of a protester, Mohammed Hashim Matter, a young engineer who was killed in the sit-in dispersal earlier this month. “Mohammed had written on his social media: ‘I have painted the sky blue,” she said, referring to hopes for change in Sudan aroused by the protesters. “After his death, his friends launched a social media campaign and changed their profile pictures to blue, Mohammed’s favourite.” Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day’s most important headlines.

"344"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-italian-director-franco-zeffirelli-dies-at-96/"|"Colleen Barry"|"Italian director Franco Zeffirelli, who delighted audiences around the world with his romantic vision and often extravagant productions, most famously captured in his cinematic Romeo and Juliet, has died in Rome at 96. While Zeffirelli was most popularly known for his films, his name was also inextricably linked to the theatre and opera. Showing great flexibility, he produced classics for the world’s most famous opera houses, from Milan’s venerable La Scala to the Metropolitan in New York, and plays for London and Italian stages. Zeffirelli’s son Luciano said his father died at home on Saturday. “He had suffered for a while, but he left in a peaceful way,” he said. Zeffirelli made it his mission to make culture accessible to the masses, often seeking inspiration in Shakespeare and other literary greats for his films, and producing operas aimed at TV audiences. Claiming no favourites, Zeffirelli once likened himself to a sultan with a harem of three: film, theatre and opera. “I am not a film director. I am a director who uses different instruments to express his dreams and his stories - to make people dream,” Zeffirelli told The Associated Press in a 2006 interview. From his out-of-wedlock birth on the outskirts of Florence on Feb. 12, 1923, Zeffirelli rose to be one of Italy’s most prolific directors, working with such opera greats as Luciano Pavarotti, Placido Domingo and his beloved Maria Callas, as well Hollywood stars including Elizabeth Taylor, Mel Gibson, Cher and Judi Dench. Throughout his career, Zeffirelli took risks — and his audacity paid off at the box office. His screen success in America was a rarity among Italian filmmakers, and he prided himself on knowing the tastes of modern moviegoers. He was one of the few Italian directors close to the Vatican, and the church turned to Zeffirelli’s theatrical touch for live telecasts of the 1978 papal installation and the 1983 Holy Year opening ceremonies in St. Peter’s Basilica. Former Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi also tapped him to direct a few high-profile events. But Zeffirelli was best known outside Italy for his colorful, softly-focused romantic films. His 1968 Romeo and Juliet brought Shakespeare’s story to a new and appreciative generation, and his Brother Sun, Sister Moon told the life of St. Francis in parables involving modern and 13th-century youth. Romeo and Juliet set box-office records in the United States, though it was made with two unknown actors, Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey. The film, which cost $1.5 million, grossed $52 million and became the most successful Shakespearian movie ever. In the 1970s, Zeffirelli’s focus shifted from the romantic to the spiritual. His 1977 made-for-television Life of Jesus became an instant classic with its portrayal of a Christ who seemed authentic and relevant. Shown around the world, the film earned more than $300 million. Where Zeffirelli worked, however, controversy was never far away. In 1978, he threatened to leave Italy for good because of harsh attacks against him and his art by leftist groups in his country, who saw Zeffirelli as an exponent of Hollywood. On the other hand, piqued by American criticism of his 1981 movie Endless Love, starring Brooke Shields, Zeffirelli said he might never make another film in the U.S. The movie, as he predicted, was a box office success. Zeffirelli wrote about the then-scandalous circumstances of his birth in his 2006 autobiography, recounting how his mother attended her husband’s funeral pregnant with another man’s child. Unable to give the baby either her or his father’s names, she intended to name him Zeffiretti, after an aria in Mozart’s Cosi fan Tutti, but a typographical error made it Zeffirelli, making him “the only person in the world with Zeffirelli as a name, thanks to my mother’s folly.” His mother died of tuberculosis when he was 6, and Zeffirelli went to live with his father’s cousin, whom he affectionately called Zia (Aunt) Lide. It was during this period of his childhood, living in Zia Lide’s house with weekly visits from his father, that Zeffirelli developed passions that would shape his life. The first was for opera, after seeing Wagner’s Walkuere at age 8 or 9 in Florence. The second was a love of English culture and literature, after his father started him on thrice-weekly English lessons with a British expatriate living in Florence. His experiences with the British expatriate community under fascism, and their staunch disbelief that they would be victimized by Benito Mussolini’s regime, were at the heart of the semi-autobiographical 1991 film Tea with Mussolini. He remained ever an Anglophile, and was particularly proud when Britain conferred on him an honorary knighthood in 2004 — the only Italian citizen to have received the honour. As a youth, Zeffirelli served with the partisans during World War II. He later acted as an interpreter for British troops. The lifelong bachelor turned from architecture to acting at the age of 20 when he joined an experimental troupe in his native city. After a short-lived acting career, Zeffirelli worked with Luchino Visconti’s theatrical company in Rome, where he showed a flair for dramatic staging techniques in A Streetcar Named Desire and Troilus and Cressida. He later served as assistant director under Italian film masters Michelangelo Antonioni and Vittorio De Sica. In 1950, he began a long and fruitful association with lyric theatre, working as a director, set designer and costumist, and bringing new life to works by his personal favourites — Mozart, Rossini, Donizetti and Verdi. Over the next decade, he staged dozens of operas, romantic melodramas and contemporary works in Italian and other European theatres, eventually earning a reputation as one of the world’s best directors of musical theatre. Both La Scala and New York’s Metropolitan Opera later played host to Zeffirelli’s classic staging of La Boheme, which was shown nationally on American television in 1982. Zeffirelli returned to prose theatre in 1961 with an innovative interpretation of Romeo and Juliet at London’s Old Vic. British critics immediately termed it “revolutionary,” and the director used it as the basis of frequent later productions and the 1968 film. His first film effort in 1958, a comedy he wrote called Camping, had limited success. But eight years later, he directed Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton in Shakespeare’s The Taming of the Shrew, and made his distinctive mark on world cinema. When Zeffirelli decided to do La Traviata on film, he had already worked his stage version of the opera into a classic, performed at Milan’s La Scala with soprano Maria Callas. He had been planning the film since 1950, he said. “In the last 30 years, I’ve done everything a lyric theatre artist can do,” Zeffirelli wrote in an article for Italy’s Corriere della Sera as the film was released in 1983. “This work is the one that crowns all my hopes and gratifies all my ambitions.” The film, with Teresa Stratas and Placido Domingo in the lead roles, found near-unanimous critical acclaim on both sides of the Atlantic — a rarity for Zeffirelli — and received Oscar nominations for costuming, scenography and artistic direction. Zeffirelli worked on a new staging of La Traviata as his last project, which will open the 2019 Opera Festival on June 21 at the Verona Arena. “We’ll pay him a final tribute with one of his most loved operas,” said artistic director Cecilia Gasdia. “He’ll be with us.” Zeffirelli often turned his talents toward his native city. In 1983, he wrote a historical portrait of Florence during the 15th and 16th centuries, what he called the “political utopia.” During the disastrous 1966 Florence floods, Zeffirelli produced a well-received documentary on the damage done to the city and its art. “I feel more like a Florentine than an Italian,” Zeffirelli once said. “A citizen of a Florence that was once the capital of Western civilization.” Accused by some of heavy-handedness in his staging techniques, Zeffirelli fought frequent verbal battles with others in Italian theatre. “Zeffirelli doesn’t realize that an empty stage can be more dramatic than a stage full of junk,” Carmelo Bene, an avant-garde Italian director and actor and frequent Zeffirelli critic, once said. It was a criticism that some reserved for his lavish production of Aida to open La Scala’s 2006-7 season — his first return to the Milan opera house in a dozen years and the fifth Aida of his career. The production was a popular success, but may be remembered more for the turbulent exit of the lead tenor, Roberto Alagna, after being booed from the loggia. “I’m 83 and I’ve really been working like mad since I was a kid. I’ve done everything, but I never really feel that I have said everything I have to say,” Zeffirelli told The Associated Press shortly before the opening of Aida. Zeffirelli had trouble with his balance after contracting a life-threatening infection during hip surgery in 1999, but didn’t let that slow him down. “I always have to cling on this or that to walk … but the mind is absolutely intact,” he said in the AP interview.

"345"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-boris-johnson-gets-boost-in-race-to-become-britains-new-pm-as-former/"|"Guy Faulconbridge Elizabeth Piper"|"Boris Johnson got a boost in his campaign to replace British Prime Minister Theresa May on Monday when one of his former rivals and European Union supporter Matt Hancock backed him saying he was almost certain to win the contest. Mr. Johnson, a former London mayor and foreign minister, is way out in front in the race to become leader of the Conservative Party and despite so far deciding to steer clear of debates with his rivals, his popularity has yet to be dented. Most of the other five hopefuls concede that Johnson, whose career has been marked by gaffes and scandals, will almost definitely make the final two in the race, when mainly pro-Brexit Conservative Party members will cast the deciding votes. But the race is on to decide who will challenge him. Health Secretary Hancock, who dropped out of the race on Friday after winning 20 votes in the first ballot of Conservative lawmakers, said Mr. Johnson was the best candidate to lead the party. “Boris has run a disciplined campaign and is almost certainly going to be our next prime minister,” Mr. Hancock said in an article in the Times newspaper, which tapped him as a strong contender to become finance minister. “My view is that we need to start coming together sooner rather than later.” Mr. Johnson, the face of the official campaign to leave the European Union in the 2016 referendum, has promised to lead the United Kingdom out of the EU with or without a deal. But parliament has indicated it will try to stop a no-deal Brexit, which investors warn could roil markets and shock the world economy, while the EU has said it will not renegotiate the Withdrawal Agreement that May agreed. According to economists polled by Reuters, the likelihood of a no-deal exit has jumped in the past month. Almost three years since Britain voted to leave the EU, the country, the parliament and both main parties are still deeply divided over Brexit. But all of the Conservative leadership contestants agree they must take Britain out of the bloc. Mr. Johnson won the support of 114 of 313 Conservative Party lawmakers in the first round of the leadership contest. Any candidate with 32 votes or fewer is eliminated. If all candidates have more than 32 votes, the one with the fewest is eliminated. For the other five, the fight was on to prove they had what it takes to challenge Mr. Johnson, or at least test some of his arguments. “This is a two-horse race, and we know one of these horses – it’s Boris … There is literally only one question you have to answer, who is likely to beat Boris?” international development minister Rory Stewart said in an appeal to other lawmakers. “He (Boris) doesn’t, as far as I can see, he doesn’t have a plan. I say as far as I can see because he doesn’t talk to me, he doesn’t talk to you, he doesn’t talk to the public,” said Mr. Stewart, who is now placed second favourite. Environment minister Michael Gove also took a dig at Mr. Johnson, saying his absence from Monday’s hustings in Westminster was described to him as being like “Hamlet without a prince”. “And of course we all remember that at the end of Hamlet, he isn’t the king,” Gove added. If Johnson does win the top job and does go for a no-deal Brexit, a constitutional crisis could be on the horizon if parliament tries to block such a departure. Pro-Brexit candidate Dominic Raab has said parliament could be suspended if necessary, a possibility he refused to rule out on Sunday in a debate with other contenders. But the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, said it was fantasy to think that the lower house of parliament could be pushed aside. “It’s a joke!” Mr. Bercow told French newspaper Le Figaro. “The idea that the British parliament can be pushed aside when such a crucial decision is to be made is fantasy.” "|"Boris Johnson gets boost in race to become Britain’s new PM as former rival backs him"|"2019-06-17T08:59:49-0400"|"Boris Johnson,Britain,British prime minister,Theresa May,Conservative Party,news,world,Matt Hancock,boris,parliament,race,minister,johnson,britain,campaign", 
"346"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-pompeo-tries-rallying-foreign-leaders-over-alleged-oil-tanker-attacks/"|"Ellen Knickmeyer"|"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is working the phones to convince wary leaders in Asia and Europe that Iran was behind alleged attacks on shipping in a key Middle East oil route – and that it’s a problem for the whole international community to deal with, not just the United States. While calling U.S. evidence “unmistakable” that Iran was to blame for alleged attacks on two oil tankers last week near the Strait of Hormuz, Pompeo was emphasizing international diplomacy over any possible new U.S. military response in appearances on Sunday news shows. “We are going to work to build out a set of countries that have deep vested interest in keeping that strait open to help us do that,” Pompeo said. “I made a bunch of phone calls yesterday. I’ll make a whole bunch more calls today. The world needs to unite,” Pompeo said. He did not say what kind of action the Trump administration was envisioning. Iran has denied being involved in the attacks and accused America of promoting an “Iranophobic” campaign against it. Pressed on whether new U.S. military deployment to the region was possible, Pompeo said that “of course” remained among the options that President Donald Trump may consider to keep oil tankers moving through the narrow strait, a strategic choke point for oil shipments from the Middle East. Trump last year withdrew the U.S. from an international agreement, signed in 2015 by President Barack Obama, to limit Iran’s nuclear program. Trump has reinstated economic sanctions and recently ended waivers that allowed some countries to continue buying Iranian oil. That has deprived Iran of oil income and has coincided with what U.S. officials said was a surge in intelligence pointing to Iranian preparations for attacks against U.S. forces and interests in the Gulf region. The U.S. has accelerated the deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier battle group to the region, sent four nuclear-capable B-52 bombers to Qatar and bolstered its defences in the region by deploying more Patriot air defence systems. Some European allies have called for a careful investigation of responsibility, worried that Trump was escalating tensions with a country he has long called a top U.S. enemy. Pompeo stressed that the U.S. gets relatively little of its energy supplies through the strait, which lies between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. The U.S. Energy Information Administration says 16 per cent of U.S. petroleum imports came from the Persian Gulf countries in 2018. By contrast, about 80% of oil through the shipping passage supplies energy-hungry countries in Asia, including China, Japan, India and South Korea. Those countries have an interest in keeping the oil flowing, he said. “I’m confident that when they see the risk – the risk of their own economies and their own people and outrageous behaviour of the Islamic Republic of Iran, they will join us in this,” Pompeo said. Pompeo said intelligence officials had “lots of data, lots of evidence” that Iran was responsible. Pressed for specifics, Pompeo pointed to grainy black-and-white footage already released by the U.S. American officials say the footage shows Iranian Revolutionary Guard troops removing an unexploded mine from a Japanese tanker. The tanker’s crew gave an apparently different account, saying “flying objects” targeted the vessel. Pompeo said the administration had shared the video and other unspecified evidence with Germany and other nations. Asked if the U.S. had a credibility problem with allies worried Trump could be seeking a pretext to move against Iran, the secretary of state said, “We’re not selling anything. These … these are simple facts.” Pompeo spoke on “Fox News Sunday” and CBS’s “Face the Nation.” "|"Pompeo tries rallying foreign leaders over alleged oil tanker attacks"|"2019-06-17T00:17:27-0400"|"International,Secretary of State,Mike Pompeo,United States,Iran,Trump,oil,oil tanker,energy,pompeo,iran,trump,region,strait,bunch",

One student was airlifted to a hospital with severe injuries, Mississippi Highway Patrol spokesman Sgt. Ronnie Shive told The Greenwood Commonwealth. Shive said 20 others who were hospitalized had bruises and abrasions. The bus was carrying 40 students and three football coaches back to Greenwood from a football camp in Starkville, Greenwood school district spokeswoman Margaret Dean said, adding that head football coach Clinton Gatewood was driving. An initial investigation shows Gatewood lost control of the bus and that it ran off the right edge of the pavement, Shive said. Gatewood overcorrected and crossed over the left edge of the road, Shive said, with the bus then flipping onto its side as Gatewood tried to swerve back to the right. Gatewood spoke briefly to the newspaper before he hung up, saying, “I want to be with my kids now.” Carroll County Emergency Management Director Ken Strachan said no other vehicles were involved in the crash on U.S. 82 between Winona and Carrollton, on the edge of Mississippi’s Delta region. Shive says state troopers and Carroll County sheriff’s deputies had difficulty accounting for students and coaches as parents arrived in their own vehicles and took groups of students from the scene.

"348"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-ousted-egyptian-president-morsi-dies-in-court-state-television/"|"Samy Magdy"|"Egypt’s first democratically elected president, Islamist leader Mohammed Morsi, who was ousted by the military in 2013 after a year in office, collapsed in court while on trial Monday and died, state TV and his family said. The 67-year-old Mr. Morsi had just addressed the court, speaking from the glass cage he is kept in during sessions and warning that he had “many secrets” he could reveal, a judicial official said. A few minutes afterward, he collapsed in the cage, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the press. In his final comments, he continued to insist he was Egypt’s legitimate president, demanding a special tribunal, one of his defence lawyers, Kamel Madour told the Associated Press. State TV said Mr. Morsi died before he could be taken to the hospital. Mr. Morsi’s Muslim Brotherhood accused the government of “assassinating” him through years of poor prison conditions. In a statement, the group demanded an international investigation into Mr. Morsi’s death and called on Egyptians to protest outside Egypt’s embassy across the world. Mr. Morsi, who was known to have diabetes, had been imprisoned since his 2013 ouster, often in solitary confinement and barred from visitors – his family was allowed to visit only three times during that time. Egypt’s chief prosecutor said Mr. Morsi’s body would be examined to determine the cause of his death. It was a dramatic end for a figure who was central in the twists and turns taken by Egypt since its “revolution” – from the pro-democracy uprising that in 2011 ousted the country’s long-time authoritarian leader, Hosni Mubarak, through controversial Islamist rule and now back to a tight grip under the domination of military men. The Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt’s most powerful Islamist group, won the elections held after Mr. Mubarak’s fall, considered the first free votes the country had seen. First, they gained a majority in parliament, then Mr. Morsi squeaked to victory in presidential elections held in 2012, becoming the first civilian to hold the office. Critics accused the Brotherhood of using violence against opponents and seeking to monopolize power and Islamize the state. Massive protests grew against their rule, until the military – led by then-defence minister Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi – ousted Mr. Morsi in July, 2013, dissolved Parliament and eventually banned the Brotherhood as a “terrorist group.” Mr. El-Sisi was elected president and re-elected in 2018 in votes human-rights groups sharply criticized as undemocratic. He has waged a ferocious crackdown that crushed the Brotherhood but also almost all other dissent, arresting tens of thousands, banning protests and silencing most criticism in the media. Since his ouster, Mr. Morsi and other Brotherhood leaders have been put on multiple and lengthy trials. Mr. Morsi was sentenced to 20 years in prison on charges of ordering Brotherhood members to break up a protest against him, resulting in deaths. Multiple cases are still pending. Monday’s session was part of a retrial, held inside Cairo’s Tora Prison, on charges of espionage with the Palestinian Hamas militant group. Mr. Morsi was held in a special wing in Tora nicknamed Scorpion Prison. Rights groups say its conditions fall far below Egyptian and international standards. In contrast, Mr. Mubarak was allowed to stay in a military hospital during trials on various charges – of which he was eventually cleared and allowed free. Sarah Leah Whitson, director of the Middle East and North Africa division with the Human Rights Watch, said in a tweet that Morsi’s death was “terrible but entirely predictable” given the government “failure to allow him adequate medical care, much less family visits.” Mohammed Sudan, leading member of the Muslim Brotherhood in London, said Mr. Morsi was banned from receiving medicine or visits and there was little information about his health condition. “This is premeditated murder. This is slow death,” he said. Freedom and Justice, the Brotherhood’s political arm, said in a statement on its Facebook page that prison conditions led to Mr. Morsi’s death in what amounted to “assassination.” The judicial official said Mr. Morsi had asked to speak to the court during Monday’s session. The judge permitted it, and Morsi gave a speech saying he had “many secrets” that, if he told them, he would be released, but he added that he wasn’t telling them because it would harm Egypt’s national security. Madour, the defence lawyer, said Morsi spoke for around five minutes, “very calm and organized,” before collapsing inside the cage. A spokesman for the Interior Ministry did not answer calls seeking comment. Mr. Morsi, an engineer who studied at the University of Southern California, was an unlikely figure to be thrust into Egypt’s central stage. He was never considered a major thinker in the Brotherhood and instead rose through its ranks as an efficient, if lacklustre, loyalist. The group only put him forward as its presidential candidate in 2012 after a more prominent and powerful figure, Khairat al-Shater, was declared ineligible to run. The election victories were the crowning point for the Brotherhood, which had been banned under Mr. Mubarak but even underground had been the most organized opposition force. Initially, Mr. Morsi made gestures toward the secular pro-democracy activists who led the 2011 Arab Spring uprising. But over the course of the year, opponents accused his Brotherhood of hijacking the revolution and trying to entrench Islamist rule. Major protests erupted, particularly over the process of writing a new constitution in which critics said the Brotherhood was allowing Islamists to write a charter largely on their terms. Brotherhood supporters cracked down violently on some protests. As protests grew, the military stepped in. Critics called the move a coup, but Mr. el-Sisi’s supporters call it a popularly backed move. The subsequent crackdown has all but completely dismantled the Brotherhood, with hundreds killed and thousands imprisoned, with most other active figures fleeing abroad. At the same time, secular pro-democracy activists were also crushed. Throughout his trials, Mr. Morsi insisted he remained Egypt’s legitimate president. In early court sessions, he gave angry speeches until judges ordered him kept in a glass cage during sessions where they could turn off his audio. In audio leaked from a 2017 session of one of his trials, Mr. Morsi complained that he was “completely isolated” from the court, unable to see or hear his defence team, his eyes pained by lighting inside the cage. “I don’t know where I am,” he is heard saying in the audio. “It’s steel behind steel and glass behind glass. The reflection of my image makes me dizzy.” Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day’s most important headlines.

The attack late Sunday took place in the village of Wadehi, south of Aleppo city, which abuts the last rebel-held enclave. Syria’s state TV said children were among those killed and some of the wounded were in critical conditions. State TV said more rockets landed as people tried to escape from the scene of the attack. One woman said that a missile landed in a room where four girls were, killing them. Another girl said her two sisters and one brother were killed in the strike. A doctor speaking to the TV station said three of the wounded were in critical condition. Images from inside an Aleppo hospital broadcast on state TV show men and children lying on stretchers, some with their heads bandaged, while others have what appears to be abdomen wounds. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also reported fatalities, saying four children were killed in the attack. State TV said the military responded to the source of fire, areas controlled by insurgents in the nearby rebel stronghold. Fighting has raged over the last seven weeks in northwestern Syria as government forces press an offensive toward the last rebel stronghold in the country’s eight-year civil war. The violence has displaced hundreds of thousands inside the rebel enclave, which is home to 3 million people, most of them already displaced from earlier violence in Syria. At least 300 civilians were killed in government bombings, and over two dozen health facilities were put out of service following air strikes. Separately, in eastern Syria’s town of Qamishli, a car bomb went off near the headquarters of the Kurdish security forces, leaving several people injured. Qamishli is run by Kurdish-led administrators and forces, but Syrian government troops hold pockets of territory there, including the airport. The area has largely been spared much of the violence that has wrecked Syria. But attacks, mostly blamed on Islamic State militants, have occurred recently in areas in eastern Syria after the extremists were kicked out of their last territorial enclave in Syria earlier this year. In a video by the Kurdish news agency Hawar, the explosion appeared to have damaged a number of cars nearby. Then authorities lifted the mangled car bomb from the area. The Observatory said seven were injured when a suicide bomber detonated the car bomb after failing to drive into the Kurdish security forces headquarters.

The Pentagon said the deployment includes security forces and troops for additional surveillance and intelligence gathering in the region. While the number is small, it represents an escalation of U.S. military might aimed at deterring Iran and calming allies worried that transit through key shipping lanes could be in jeopardy. Tehran’s announcement earlier Monday means it could soon start to enrich uranium to just a step away from weapons-grade levels, challenging President Donald Trump’s assurances to allies that the U.S. withdrawal from the deal last year made the world a safer place. The developments are bound to inflame tensions in the Middle East and pose a test of resolve and credibility for both adversaries. Iran said it would break a limit on uranium stockpiles established by the 2015 agreement with world powers that was intended to restrict the Islamic Republic’s nuclear program in exchange for an easing of international sanctions. After Trump withdrew from the agreement, signed by his predecessor, he reinstated punishing economic sanctions, leaving the European and other partners in the accord struggling to keep Iran on board. On Monday, the U.S. administration found itself in the awkward position of demanding that Iran comply with a nuclear accord that the president derided as the worst deal in history. “We continue to call on the Iranian regime not to obtain a nuclear weapon, to abide by their commitments to the international community,” State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus told reporters. The move comes as Washington accuses Iran of attacking two tankers near the Persian Gulf and the Iranians deny responsibility. With details murky and no one owning up to the attacks, the Pentagon released new photos intended to bolster its case that Iran carried out the attacks. The State Department spokeswoman said Iran’s uranium announcement amounted to “extortion” and a “challenge to international norms,” as well as to the 2015 agreement known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. “It’s unfortunate that they have made this announcement today,” Ortagus said. “It doesn’t surprise anybody and this is why the president has often said that the JCPOA needs to be replaced with a better deal.” Trump appeared to say the deal should not be violated in a tweet: “Iran to defy Uranium Stockpile Limits.” In announcing the new deployment, Acting Defence Secretary Patrick Shanahan said the forces are “for defensive purposes to address air, naval, and ground-based threats in the Middle East.” “The United States does not seek conflict with Iran,” Shanahan said. “The action today is being taken to ensure the safety and welfare of our military personnel working throughout the region and to protect our national interests.” He added that the U.S. will continue to adjust troop levels as needed. On the unravelling of the multinational nuclear deal, some of its supporters blamed the Trump administration for Iran’s provocative announcements, saying they were predictable given the renewed U.S. pressure. “While Iran’s frustration with Trump’s reckless and irresponsible pressure campaign is understandable, we strongly urge Iran to remain in compliance with the nuclear deal,” the Arms Control Association said in a statement. “It remains in Iran’s interests to abide by the limits of the agreement and to fully co-operate with the International Atomic Energy Agency’s more intrusive monitoring and verification.” Iran has shown no willingness to negotiate another deal and vowed not enter into talks with the United States while the administration maintains its “maximum pressure” campaign of sanctions. Administration officials found themselves Monday grappling with whether to press the remaining parties to the deal, including Britain, France and Germany, to demand that Iran stay in compliance. They must also consider if such a stance would essentially concede that the restrictions imposed during the Obama administration, while short of ideal, are better than none. Under the deal, Iran can keep a stockpile of no more than 660 pounds (300 kilograms) of low-enriched uranium. Behrouz Kamalvandi, spokesman for Iran’s atomic agency, said it would pass that limit June 27. A senior U.S. official said the administration is most concerned about any violation of the deal that would reduce the breakout time that Iran would need to produce a nuclear weapon. The deal aimed to keep the breakout time at one year. The official said certain violations, while they should be not accepted, would not necessarily reduce that time. But other violations, such as enriching uranium to 20%, should be addressed immediately if they occur, the official said. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The official said it would be up to the Europeans to decide if Iran was in violation of the deal and whether to initiate a dispute resolution mechanism that could bring the Iranians back into compliance. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is expected to meet this week with E.U. foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, a leading deal proponent, at which this issue is likely to be raised. Pompeo, who was a leading critic of the deal while he was in Congress, has said in the past that Iranian compliance is not really an issue as the administration sees the agreement as fundamentally flawed because over time it eases many limits on Iran’s nuclear activities. Yet, just last week, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N.’s nuclear watchdog accused Iran of violating a provision of the deal that relates to advanced centrifuges and called on the Europeans to ensure that Iran remains in compliance.

Worries about a confrontation between Iran and the United States have mounted since attacks last week on two oil tankers near the strategic Strait of Hormuz shipping lane at the entrance to the Gulf. Washington blamed long-time foe Iran for the incidents. Tehran denies responsibility but the attacks, and similar ones in May, have further soured relations that have plummeted since Trump pulled the United States out of a landmark international nuclear deal with Iran in May, 2018. Mr. Trump has restored and extended U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. That has forced countries around the world to boycott Iranian oil or face sanctions of their own. But in an interview with Time magazine, Mr. Trump, striking a different tone from some Republican lawmakers who have urged a military approach to Iran, said last week’s tanker attacks in the Gulf of Oman had only a “very minor” impact so far. Asked if he would consider military action to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons or to ensure the free flow of oil through the Gulf, Mr. Trump said: “I would certainly go over nuclear weapons and I would keep the other a question mark.” The nuclear deal with Iran, which was reached in 2015 during Barack Obama’s presidency, aimed to head off any pathway to an Iranian nuclear bomb. Mr. Trump says the agreement failed to address Iran’s missile program or punish it for waging proxy wars in Middle East countries. Tehran has decried the toughening of U.S. sanctions and urged other signatories to take action to save the nuclear pact or see Iran turn its back on the deal. The United States will maintain its pressure campaign on Iran and continue to deter aggression in the region but does not want the conflict with Tehran to escalate, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Tuesday. “We have been engaged in many messages, even this moment right here, communicating to Iran that we are there to deter aggression,” Mr. Pompeo told reporters. “President Trump does not want war and we will continue to communicate that message while doing the things that are necessary to protect American interests in the region.” As tension with Iran rises, uncertainty about leadership of the Pentagon grew on Tuesday with the news that acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan had withdrawn from consideration to head the U.S. military. USA Today has reported the FBI had been examining a 9-year-old domestic dispute involving Mr. Shanahan and his then-wife. Mr. Shanahan on Monday had announced the deployment of about 1,000 more troops to the Middle East for what he said were defensive purposes, citing concerns about a threat from Iran. The deployment is in addition to a 1,500-troop increase announced last month in response to tanker attacks in May. Russia told the United States it should drop what it called provocative plans to deploy more troops to the Middle East and cease actions that looked like a conscious attempt to provoke war with Iran, and urged restraint on all sides. “What we see are unending and sustained U.S. attempts to crank up political, psychological, economic and yes military pressure on Iran in quite a provocative way,” Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov was cited as saying by Russian media. “They [these actions] cannot be assessed as anything but a conscious course to provoke war,” he said. China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, warned the world should not open a “Pandora’s box” in the Middle East, as he denounced U.S. pressure on Iran and urged Tehran to heed the deal. Chancellor Angela Merkel said Germany, another signatory, was doing all it could to ease tensions with Iran, but said Iran must abide by the 2015 deal. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in a speech that Iran did not seek war and dismissed U.S. efforts to isolate Iran. “Iran will not wage war against any nation,” he said. “Despite all of the Americans’ efforts in the region and their desire to cut off our ties with all of the world and their desire to keep Iran secluded, they have been unsuccessful.” But the commander of Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards Corps said on Tuesday that Iran’s ballistic missiles were capable of hitting “carriers in the sea” with great precision. “These missiles are domestically produced and are difficult to intercept and hit with other missiles,” Brigadier General Hossein Salami said in a televised speech. He said Iran’s ballistic missile technology had changed the balance of power in the Middle East. Heightened Iran-U.S. tensions have stoked fears of increased violence in countries where Iran and its Gulf Arab regional rivals are locked in a sometimes bloody struggle for influence. Saudi air defences intercepted two drones fired by Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthi group, Saudi media said on Tuesday. The group’s Al Masirah TV said the Houthis had sent drones to strike the airport of the Saudi city of Abha. Three rockets landed on a military base hosting U.S. forces north of Baghdad late on Monday, an Iraqi military statement said, without providing further details. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. U.S. officials said last month there was an increased threat from Iran-backed militias against U.S. interests in Iraq, and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad evacuated hundreds of staff.

Governor Jean Bamanisa told The Associated Press that 161 bodies had been found and authorities were still trying to determine the extent of the violence. The violence has been taking place in a remote area of Congo near South Sudan and Uganda where the UN said it and humanitarian groups don’t have much access. Thousands of people were said to be sleeping in the open and without any kind of food aid. Authorities believe the perpetrators were militia fighters from the Lendu community. Congo’s military believes they are linked to Mathieu Ngudjolo, who was acquitted of war crimes at the International Criminal Court in 2012. Untold thousands of people lost their lives in conflicts between the Lendu and Hema communities between 1999 and 2004. UN peacekeepers were dispatched to Congo to try to maintain order and remain in the region combatting various rebel groups. New unrest was seen in 2017 and 2018. The fresh violence involves both the Lendu and Hema groups, the UN refugee agency said, adding that the situation in Ituri had deteriorated in the past week. “People are fleeing attacks and counter attacks in Djugu territory, with reports of both communities forming self-defence groups and being involved in revenge killings,” UN spokesman Babar Baloch told reporters in Geneva. Baloch said they had received reports of “kidnappings, maiming and sexual violence” and that Congolese military operations were reportedly underway to calm the unrest.

The magnitude 6.4 quake, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), lasted for as long as 20 seconds and damage included a landslide that struck a road, according to public broadcaster NHK. There were no initial reports of fatalities or fires. Authorities lifted a 0.2-1.0 metre tsunami warning for the region after waves several centimetres high struck parts of the Niigata coast. A tsunami of up to one metre could have caused some flooding and damage in low-lying coastal areas and river banks, though much of Japan’s coastline is guarded by seawalls. “We will work closely with local authorities to provide any disaster measures including life-saving and rescue operations and have instructed officials to provide information in a timely and accurate manner,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga – the top government spokesman – told a media briefing. The quake struck at 10.22 p.m. local time (1322 GMT Thursday) at a depth of 12 kilometres, the USGS said. It measured 6.7 according to the Japan Meteorological Agency, and in some places was as high as a strong six on the agency’s seven-point “Shindo”, or Seismic Intensity Scale, which measures ground motion at specific points unlike magnitude which expresses the amount of energy released. Tokyo Electric Power Co’s (Tepco) Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear plant was not affected by the quake, which hit 85 km northeast of the site. All of its seven reactors were already shut down, NHK said. A Tepco spokesman said an initial inspection showed no damage to the plant, and inspectors would carry out more detailed checks. The quake also temporarily halted express bullet train services in the region, with some roads also closed, according to NHK.

"356"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-ousted-egyptian-president-mohammed-morsi-buried-after-courtroom-death/"|"Samy Magdy"|"Egypt’s first democratically elected president, Islamist leader Mohammed Morsi, was buried under heavy security early on Tuesday, a day after his dramatic collapse and death inside a Cairo courtroom, his family and a member of his defence team said. Morsi’s family attended funeral prayers in the mosque of Cairo’s Tora prison, followed by the burial at a cemetery in the Egyptian capital’s eastern district of Nasr City, said Abdul-Moneim Abdel-Maqsoud, a member of Morsi’s defence team. Morsi’s son Ahmed said security agencies refused to allow Morsi to be buried at the family’s cemetery in his hometown in Sharqia province, and instead had him interred at a Cairo cemetery dedicated to prominent Islamists. Morsi, 67, hailed from Egypt’s largest Islamist group, the now outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, and was elected president in 2012 in the country’s first free elections following the ouster the year before of long-time autocrat Hosni Mubarak. The military toppled Morsi in 2013 after massive protests and crushed the Brotherhood in a major crackdown, arresting Morsi and many others of the group’s leaders. During his years in prison, Morsi, who was known to have diabetes, was often held in solitary confinement and was largely barred from receiving visitors. His family was only allowed to visit three times. While in detention, Morsi continued to appear in court on a range of charges. In early court sessions he gave angry speeches until judges ordered him kept in a glass cage where they could turn off his audio. Morsi’s Brotherhood accused the government of “assassinating” him through years of poor prison conditions. The group demanded an international investigation into Morsi’s death on Monday and called on Egyptians to protest outside Egyptian embassies across the world. Late on Monday, Egypt’s chief prosecutor said Morsi’s body would be examined to determine the cause of his death. State TV, citing an unnamed medical source, said he died after suffering a heart attack. Morsi collapsed just after he had addressed the court, speaking from inside the glass cage and warning that he had “many secrets” he could reveal, a judicial official said, speaking on condition of anonymity under regulations. In his final comments, Morsi continued to insist he was Egypt’s legitimate president, demanding a special tribunal, one of his defence lawyers, Kamel Mandour told The Associated Press. State TV said Morsi died before he could be taken to hospital. There were a dozen other Brotherhood members on trial inside the glass cage, including some physicians who in vain tried to administer CPR, said Mandour. It was a dramatic end for a figure central in the twists and turns taken by Egypt since its “revolution” – from the pro-democracy uprising that in 2011 ousted Mubarak, through controversial Islamist rule and now back to a tight grip under the domination of military men. The Brotherhood won the elections held after Mubarak’s fall, considered the first free votes the country had seen. First, they gained a majority in parliament, then Morsi squeaked to victory in presidential elections held in 2012, becoming the first civilian to hold the office. Critics accused the Brotherhood of using violence against opponents and seeking to monopolize power and Islamize the state. Massive protests grew against their rule, until the military – led by then-Defence Minister Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi – ousted Morsi in July 2013, dissolved parliament and eventually banned the Brotherhood as a “terrorist group.” In August 2013, troops descended upon protest camps filled with Morsi’s supporters, killing hundreds in Cairo’s Rabaa al-Adawiya Square and elsewhere in a single day. El-Sissi was elected president and re-elected in 2018, balloting that human rights groups sharply criticized as undemocratic. He has waged a ferocious crackdown that crushed the Brotherhood but also almost all other dissent, arresting tens of thousands, banning protests and silencing most criticism in the media. Since his ouster, Morsi and other Brotherhood leaders have been put on multiple and lengthy trials. Morsi was sentenced to 20 years in prison on charges of ordering Brotherhood members to break up a protest against him, resulting in deaths. A death sentence against him was overturned and commuted to life imprisonment while multiple cases are still pending. Monday’s session was part of a retrial on charges of espionage with the Palestinian Hamas militant group. Hamas is part of the pan-Arab Brotherhood movement but has taken measures in recent years to reconcile with the current Egyptian authorities, removing from its founding charter parts that stressed explicit affiliation with the Brotherhood. At Tuesday’s funeral, security agents turned reporters away from the cemetery, banning them from taking photographs. Reporters were also barred from travelling to Morsi’s hometown. Abdel-Moneim Abdel-Maqsoud, another Morsi lawyer, said Morsi’s imprisoned son, Ossama, was allowed to attend the burial. Ossama was sentenced to 10 years last September in a case related to the 2013 dispersal of a sit-in of Morsi’s supporters. The cemetery, which holds the remains of many top Brotherhood leaders, is also where the group’s supreme guide Mahdi Akef was buried after his 2017 death in his prison at the age of 89. Most Egyptian state-owned dailies only carried brief reports on Morsi’s death, buried in inside pages of Tuesday editions, except Al-Masry Al-Youm, which had a front-page report. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he doesn’t believe Morsi died of natural causes, without providing evidence. Erdogan made the comments at an Istanbul mosque, where hundreds held funeral prayers for Morsi, Egypt’s first democratically elected president who was ousted by the military in 2013. “Mohammed Morsi walked to join God during the trial. Whether this was a normal walk, or were there some other conditions involved, this is something to think about.” “I don’t believe that this was a normal death,” he said. Rupert Colville, spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, called Tuesday for a “prompt, impartial, thorough and transparent investigation” into Morsi’s death. Also on Tuesday, Human Rights Watch criticized Egyptian authorities for failing to provide adequate medical care for Morsi. The New York-based group’s Sarah Leah Whitson said Morsi’s treatment in prison was “horrific, and those responsible should be investigated and appropriately prosecuted.” “At the very least, the Egyptian government committed grave abuses against Morsi by denying him prisoners’ rights that met minimum standards,” she added. Egypt’s state information service later said Whitson’s statements were “nothing but false claims” that reaffirm what it called HRW’s tradition of “circulating lies.” Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day’s most important headlines.

"357"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-charles-reich-author-of-the-greening-of-america-dies-at-91/"|"Hillel Italie"|"Charles Reich, the author and Ivy League academic whose The Greening of America blessed the counterculture of the 1960s and became a million-selling manifesto for a new and euphoric way of life, has died. Mr. Reich’s nephew, Daniel, said he died on Saturday after being briefly hospitalized. Mr. Reich, a long-time resident of San Francisco, was 91. Mr. Reich was a popular Yale University professor and respected legal scholar when a 39,000-word excerpt from The Greening of America ran in The New Yorker in September, 1970, generating a massive volume of letters. The book was published a few weeks later and sold more than two million copies, making Mr. Reich a middle-aged hero for a rebellious generation despite scorn from both conservatives and liberals. The Greening of America expanded upon such critiques of conformity and consumerism as David Riesman’s The Lonely Crowd and Vance Packard’s The Status Seekers and presented American history as an evolution of consciousness, a three-part story with a surprise ending. Consciousness I, dating back to the country’s beginnings, reflected a Jeffersonian society of individualism, virtue and suspicion of government. Consciousness II, which matured in the 20th century, believed in the “organization,” in technology and government and big business. “Insanity, artificiality and untruth are the commonplace stuff of the Corporate State,” Mr. Reich wrote. The uprisings of the 1960s marked the dawn of Consciousness III, the triumph of compassion and imagination, an awakening enabled by sex, drugs and rock music. Best of all, Mr. Reich concluded, violence and mass protest were unnecessary. Consciousness II was so stagnant, so helpless “once it loses the ability to create false consciousness,” that acts as simple as refusing a promotion at work would hasten its collapse. “This is the revolution of the new generation,” he wrote. “It is both necessary and inevitable, and in time it will include not only youth, but all people in America.” The establishment thought him a fool. Newsweek’s Stewart Alsop called the book “scary mush,” while Harvard academic Charles Fried, who later became U.S. president Ronald Reagan’s solicitor-general, scorned Mr. Reich’s “fascination with anything that will procure novelty on the cheap.” On the left, activists disparaged Mr. Reich’s faith in painless change. Around the same time Greening was published, the Black Power movement was at its height and anti-war activist Tom Hayden was advocating a countrywide network of “liberated zones,” in constant battle with government forces. But young people – and some older ones – were inspired by Mr. Reich’s book, with one fan letter reading, “Right on. You’ve managed to put into words what we have known for a long time.” Garry Trudeau introduced Mr. Reich as “Professor Green” for his Doonesbury comic. Rolling Stone publisher Jann Wenner would credit Mr. Reich with persuading him to collaborate on an interview with the Grateful Dead’s Jerry Garcia. “I thought his enthusiasm a little … naive, but, what the hell,” Mr. Wenner wrote of the 1972 meeting with Mr. Garcia. “God knows, Charles ‘Consciousness III’ Reich Meets Jerry ‘Captain Trips’ Garcia could turn into something of its own.” Many lives were changed by The Greening of America, including Mr. Reich’s. Uncomfortable with fame, he left Yale in 1974 and moved to San Francisco. He let his hair grow longer and began having relationships with men. In his 1976 memoirs The Sorcerer of Bolinas Reef, he wrote that he had sensed he was gay since childhood. “I think I feared most the discovery and exposure of my secrets,” wrote Mr. Reich, who leaves his nephew and a niece, Alice Reich. Mr. Reich was born in New York in 1928, an awkward child who grew up in an affluent household, attended progressive private schools and graduated from a top liberal arts college, Oberlin University. Idealistic, but unfocused, Mr. Reich enrolled in Yale Law School after a family friend convinced him that the legal profession was a path to public leadership. Mr. Reich’s 20s and 30s were a giant step from Consciousness II to Consciousness III. A gifted legal thinker, he became editor in chief of the Yale Law Journal, clerked for (and idolized) Supreme Court justice Hugh Black and was hired by a top Washington firm, Arnold, Fortas & Power. In Washington in the 1950s, he was part of “a world which all of us believed to be at the centre, and yet typical, of American life.” But he remembered himself as a “spy” inside “a city with almost no authenticity,” a restless spirit bound up in a Brooks Brothers suit. His liberation began in 1960, when he returned to Yale. He felt more relaxed and loved the classroom, which would include such future leaders as Hillary Rodham (“a most exceptional student”) and Bill Clinton (“quite an absentee student”). His legal article The New Property helped influence the landmark 1970 Supreme Court decision in Goldberg v. Kelly that gave welfare recipients the right to a hearing before the government could cut off their benefits. In 1967, anxious for new experience, Mr. Reich acted upon a friend’s suggestion and spent the “Summer of Love” in Berkeley, Calif. The shy college professor at first resisted, but gave in to a feeling of “enchantment” with the “humour, happiness, high spirits and FREEDOM” of the long-haired youth. Back at Yale, he began teaching in a more informal style, smoked cannabis with the students and let them call him by his first name. He had been thinking of writing a book about the country’s decline, but instead prophesied a golden age. The Greening of America became a highlight of the era, and eventually an artifact. For years, the book was out of print, until an abridged e-edition came out in 2012. Mr. Reich acknowledged the tenacity of Consciousness II, but never gave up on reaching the next stage. “It could still be reality, but, at the moment, it’s viewed as something like a fantasy or a dream that people woke up from with a headache,” he said in 2010, saying young people in the 21st century were more likely to worry about having a job. “Whether you’re complaining about spiritual emptiness or material emptiness, you’re ultimately complaining about the same system that’s creating both kinds of emptiness.

"358"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-us-high-school-athletes-file-complaint-over-transgender-policy/"|"Dave Collins"|"Three Connecticut girls who have run high school track have filed a federal discrimination complaint saying a statewide policy on transgender athletes has cost them top finishes in races and possibly college scholarships. The complaint filed Monday with the U.S. Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights was submitted by the conservative Christian law firm Alliance Defending Freedom on behalf of the girls, who are asking for an investigation of the policy and orders that would make competitions fair. The complaint also cites the federal Title IX rules aimed at equal rights in sports for female athletes. “Girls deserve to compete on a level playing field,” said Christiana Holcomb, legal counsel for Alliance Defending Freedom. “Women fought long and hard to earn the equal athletic opportunities that Title IX provides. Allowing boys to compete in girls’ sports reverses nearly 50 years of advances for women under this law. We shouldn’t force these young women to be spectators in their own sports.” The Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference, which governs high school sports in the state, says its policy follows a state anti-discrimination law requiring students to be treated in school according to the gender with which they identify. That means that athletes can compete according to their expressed gender identity as opposed to their sex assigned at birth. A spokesman for the conference had no immediate comment on the complaint Tuesday. The argument that gender identity amounts to an unfair advantage in sports is a recurring one in the complex debate around intersex and transgender athletes as they break barriers in sports around the world from high school to the pros. Earlier this week, Olympic running sensation Caster Semenya — who reportedly has some intersex traits — won an interim ruling in her battle against track and field’s governing body. The Swiss supreme court ordered the suspension of regulations that would require female runners with unusually high testosterone to take medication to reduce their levels of the male sex hormone if they want to compete in certain events. The complaint from Connecticut says transgender girls have been consistently winning track and field events and the policy violates federal protections for female athletes. The athletes who filed the complaint include Selina Soule, of Glastonbury High School, and two others whose names and schools were not disclosed. Soule told The Associated Press earlier this year, after competing in a 55-meter dash won by a transgender student, that the issue is about fairness on the track. “We all know the outcome of the race before it even starts; it’s demoralizing,” she said. “I fully support and am happy for these athletes for being true to themselves. They should have the right to express themselves in school, but athletics have always had extra rules to keep the competition fair.” Connecticut is one of at least 17 states that allow transgender high school athletes to compete without restrictions, according to Transathlete.com, which tracks state policies in high school sports across the country.

Worries about a confrontation between Iran and the United States have mounted since attacks last week on two oil tankers near the strategic Strait of Hormuz shipping lane at the entrance to the Gulf. Washington blamed long-time foe Iran for the incidents. Tehran denies responsibility but the attacks, and similar ones in May, have further soured relations that have plummeted since Trump pulled the United States out of a landmark international nuclear deal with Iran in May, 2018. Mr. Trump has restored and extended U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. That has forced countries around the world to boycott Iranian oil or face sanctions of their own. But in an interview with Time magazine, Mr. Trump, striking a different tone from some Republican lawmakers who have urged a military approach to Iran, said last week’s tanker attacks in the Gulf of Oman had only a “very minor” impact so far. Asked if he would consider military action to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons or to ensure the free flow of oil through the Gulf, Mr. Trump said: “I would certainly go over nuclear weapons and I would keep the other a question mark.” The nuclear deal with Iran, which was reached in 2015 during Barack Obama’s presidency, aimed to head off any pathway to an Iranian nuclear bomb. Mr. Trump says the agreement failed to address Iran’s missile program or punish it for waging proxy wars in Middle East countries. Tehran has decried the toughening of U.S. sanctions and urged other signatories to take action to save the nuclear pact or see Iran turn its back on the deal. The United States will maintain its pressure campaign on Iran and continue to deter aggression in the region but does not want the conflict with Tehran to escalate, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Tuesday. “We have been engaged in many messages, even this moment right here, communicating to Iran that we are there to deter aggression,” Mr. Pompeo told reporters. “President Trump does not want war and we will continue to communicate that message while doing the things that are necessary to protect American interests in the region.” As tension with Iran rises, uncertainty about leadership of the Pentagon grew on Tuesday with the news that acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan had withdrawn from consideration to head the U.S. military. USA Today has reported the FBI had been examining a 9-year-old domestic dispute involving Mr. Shanahan and his then-wife. Mr. Shanahan on Monday had announced the deployment of about 1,000 more troops to the Middle East for what he said were defensive purposes, citing concerns about a threat from Iran. The deployment is in addition to a 1,500-troop increase announced last month in response to tanker attacks in May. Russia told the United States it should drop what it called provocative plans to deploy more troops to the Middle East and cease actions that looked like a conscious attempt to provoke war with Iran, and urged restraint on all sides. “What we see are unending and sustained U.S. attempts to crank up political, psychological, economic and yes military pressure on Iran in quite a provocative way,” Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov was cited as saying by Russian media. “They [these actions] cannot be assessed as anything but a conscious course to provoke war,” he said. China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, warned the world should not open a “Pandora’s box” in the Middle East, as he denounced U.S. pressure on Iran and urged Tehran to heed the deal. Chancellor Angela Merkel said Germany, another signatory, was doing all it could to ease tensions with Iran, but said Iran must abide by the 2015 deal. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in a speech that Iran did not seek war and dismissed U.S. efforts to isolate Iran. “Iran will not wage war against any nation,” he said. “Despite all of the Americans’ efforts in the region and their desire to cut off our ties with all of the world and their desire to keep Iran secluded, they have been unsuccessful.” But the commander of Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards Corps said on Tuesday that Iran’s ballistic missiles were capable of hitting “carriers in the sea” with great precision. “These missiles are domestically produced and are difficult to intercept and hit with other missiles,” Brigadier General Hossein Salami said in a televised speech. He said Iran’s ballistic missile technology had changed the balance of power in the Middle East. Heightened Iran-U.S. tensions have stoked fears of increased violence in countries where Iran and its Gulf Arab regional rivals are locked in a sometimes bloody struggle for influence. Saudi air defences intercepted two drones fired by Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthi group, Saudi media said on Tuesday. The group’s Al Masirah TV said the Houthis had sent drones to strike the airport of the Saudi city of Abha. Three rockets landed on a military base hosting U.S. forces north of Baghdad late on Monday, an Iraqi military statement said, without providing further details. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. U.S. officials said last month there was an increased threat from Iran-backed militias against U.S. interests in Iraq, and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad evacuated hundreds of staff.

The long-delayed report said that the Belt and Road - a string of ports, railways, roads and bridges and other investments connecting China to Europe via central and southern Asia - could lift 32 million people out of moderate poverty conditions if implemented fully. Still, there are “significant risks,” the World Bank said. “Achieving the ambitions of the Belt and Road Initiative will require equally ambitious reforms from participating countries,” Ceyla Pazarbasioglu, World Bank vice president for equitable growth, said in a statement. “Improvements in data reporting and transparency - especially around debt - open government procurement, and adherence to the highest social and environmental standards will help significantly,” she added. The World Bank’s new president, David Malpass, skipped China’s second Belt and Road summit in Beijing in April to take his first foreign trip to Africa instead. Malpass was a critic of Belt and Road when he was an official at the U.S. Department of the Treasury, arguing that it was saddling some countries with unsustainable debts. The report found that for some countries, the costs of new infrastructure could outweigh potential economic gains and the benefits would be unevenly distributed among participating countries. Real income gains in the Kyrgyz Republic, Pakistan, and Thailand could be above 8 percent, but Azerbaijan, Mongolia and Tajikistan could experience negative welfare gains due to high infrastructure costs, the analysis showed. The World Bank said real income for Belt and Road corridor economies could be two to four times larger if they ease trade restrictions and institute reforms to reduce border delays. Increased private-sector participation in Belt and Road, now dominated by China’s state-owned banks and enterprises, can help sustain the initiative in the long run, but participating countries would need to institute reforms to improve their investment climates, including stronger legal protections and regulations, the report said. “Little is known about the processes for selecting firms” for Belt and Road projects, the report said. “Moving toward international good practices such as open and transparent public procurement would increase the likelihood that BRI projects are allocated to the firms best placed to implement them.” There was also a need to increase transparency of debt terms and conditions for Belt and Road projects to allow governments to assess the risks to their ability to sustain debt, the report said.

"361"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-vancouver-real-estate-sees-uptick-in-interest-from-hong-kong-buyers/"|"Nathan VanderKlippe"|"Real estate agents in Vancouver have noticed something unusual in the past few weeks. For the first time in recent memory, the number of Hong Kong Chinese attending open-house showings has exceeded that of mainland Chinese buyers, who have been a visible presence in the city’s real estate market over the past decade. The people arriving at home showings in Vancouver offer a vivid example of the global dislocations under way as Hong Kong finds itself newly immersed in fear that its unique status under China’s one-country, two-systems framework is under threat. Millions have marched in the city to protest a proposed extradition law, which has heightened fears that Beijing is encroaching on the legal system that upholds the city’s liberties. Agents at Macdonald Real Estate Group in Vancouver have seen a “noticeable” change in who is arriving at doorsteps, president Dan Scarrow said. “The ratio of Hong Kong Chinese to mainland Chinese at their open houses increased significantly over the last few weekends,” he said. An estimated 300,000 people in Hong Kong hold Canadian passports and the extradition bill, even though its passage has now been suspended, has provided a new push to look elsewhere. Condo buyer’s guide: When to buy, how to finance and advice on hidden costs New study shows almost half of Vancouver condos investor owned A decade has passed since Vancouver’s empty-condo revelation “This whole episode has reminded Hong Kongers that they will be 100-per-cent mainland in 28 years regardless,” Mr. Scarrow said. Beijing has pledged to give Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy under the one-country, two-systems formula until 2047. Syrus Lee, a prominent real estate agent in the Vancouver Chinese community, has noticed the same phenomenon: The number of Hong Kong-related home buyers now exceeds those from mainland China, he said. That’s in part because the 20-per-cent foreign-buyers tax that British Columbia has placed on home purchases in the Vancouver region has caused mainland buyers to retreat. The tax doesn’t apply to Canadian citizens, including those who live in Hong Kong but are now thinking about moving to Canada amid the controversy over the extradition legislation, which was designed to ease the ability of other countries, including mainland China, to bring back people considered fugitives of serious crimes. It has raised fear in Hong Kong that it would provide an opening for Beijing to legally seize dissidents and others on trumped-up charges. At the office of Hong Win International Group, interest in buying Canadian condos is up by roughly a third over the past few months, the period during which debate over the extradition bill has seized the city. The controversy has been a “catalyst” for people who might have already been considering a move back to Canada, said Michael Chan, executive director of Hong Win, which works with property developers to sell newly built condo units to buyers in Hong Kong. His 22nd-floor office is decorated with sales trophies and brochures for condos in Toronto and Vancouver. ”This bill and these protests have really enhanced their thinking about going back,” he said, with some bringing forward moving plans by several years. Some now feel as if “they have to make a decision,” he said. Expensive housing, pricey education and a latent worry about Chinese influence have already caused some people to consider leaving Hong Kong. Thousands have moved to Taiwan, while some of the city’s ultrawealthy have discussed transferring assets to Singapore. Thousands more have become re-returnees, members of families who left for Canada decades ago, then came back to Hong Kong in following years – only to now once again move across the Pacific to Canada. Changes to Canadian immigration law have provided another impetus, since those born abroad must give birth to their own children on Canadian soil to maintain a Canadian passport. For someone in that situation, “when you see things like what’s happening in the last few years, and you feel that China is taking its place more and more in Hong Kong – often those people need a nudge, just a soft nudge, to say, ‘you know what, let’s move back,’” said Jean-François Harvey, a Canadian lawyer who is worldwide managing partner for Harvey Law Group, which specializes in immigration and taxation. And the protests and violence over the extradition law have been “a big nudge, for sure,” he said. People have been calling his office to inquire about whether there are any legal obstacles to buying a house in Canada. “The last 10 days in Hong Kong we see a big surge” in calls, Mr. Harvey said. “People are getting fed up,” he added, although at the moment it’s not “a surge of people moving out. It’s a surge of people getting ready to do that.” It doesn’t hurt, he added, that a small apartment in Hong Kong is worth enough to “buy a very nice house in Vancouver.” Property developers around the world have taken note. At Spacious, a Hong Kong-based online real estate listings service, listing and advertising inquiries from overseas developers are up by 62 per cent in the past two months. “These developers and brokers have told us they think the recent events provide an opportunity to market and sell their overseas properties to Hong Kong’s international property buyers,” chief operating officer James Fisher said. Though 2047 remains nearly three decades away, that is a relatively short time horizon for investors buying property that could be used for generations. Without any clarity from Beijing on how Hong Kong will be treated after 2047, it’s a question, Mr. Fisher said, that is likely to weigh increasingly heavily on the city. “Investors don’t like uncertainty or questionable legal systems, so the recent events are a net negative for Hong Kong asset markets, including property,” he said. And, he added, they are “a net positive for property markets favoured by internationally minded Hong Kongers – like those in the U.K., Canada, USA and Australia.” Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day’s most important headlines.

Mr. Johnson, the face of the official Brexit campaign in the 2016 referendum, won 126 out of 313 votes and so goes through to a third ballot between 1400 GMT and 1600 GMT on Wednesday with four other candidates who won 33 votes or more. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt won 46 votes, Environment Secretary Michael Gove won 41, International Development Secretary Rory Stewart 37 and Home Secretary Sajid Javid 33. While Mr. Johnson won by far the most votes, he added just 12 from the first round. Mr. Stewart was the biggest gainer from the first round, adding 18 votes. Dominic Raab, a former Brexit minister, was eliminated from the contest as he won just 30 votes. Mr. Johnson, a former London mayor and foreign minister, says he will take Britain out of the European Union by Oct. 31, whether or not there is a deal with Brussels to smooth the transition, potentially setting up a fight with parliament. In the first round this past Thursday, Mr. Johnson won 114 out of 313 votes. The candidates who survived the second round of voting were due to participate in a televised debate at 1900 GMT. Once the list is whittled down to two candidates, a postal ballot of the wider Conservative Party membership will be held to pick a leader. A new prime minister should be chosen by the end of July. Mr. Johnson, whose unconventional style has helped him shrug off a series of scandals in the past, has won over much of his party by arguing that only he can rescue it by delivering Brexit. Mr. Johnson, who in the run-up to the referendum compared the goals of the EU with those of Hitler and Napoleon, has promised to cut income tax for high earners. Boris Johnson gets boost in race to become Britain’s new PM as former rival backs him Leadership rivals lash out at front-runner Johnson for skipping TV Brexit debate Boris Johnson secures most support after first round of contest to succeed Britain’s Theresa May His rise towards Downing Street is the latest twist in an eventful career for a man whose quick wit and eccentric style have helped him shrug off a series of scandals, including getting sacked from the party’s policy team while in opposition for lying about an extramarital affair. That and other episodes earned him the tabloid nickname “Bonking Boris.” But where others would have floundered, Mr. Johnson became increasingly popular, culminating in his two victories in usually left-leaning London’s mayoral contests in 2008 and 2012. After helping to win the Brexit referendum to leave the EU in 2016, Mr. Johnson’s bid to succeed David Cameron as prime minister was scuppered when his close ally Mr. Gove abruptly deserted him and announced his own candidacy. The betrayal by Mr. Gove, whose parting shot was to say that “Boris cannot provide the leadership or build the team for the task ahead,” stopped Mr. Johnson’s march on Downing Street in 2016, allowing Ms. May to win the top job. But her failure to get a divorce deal ratified by the British parliament destroyed her premiership. “We must leave the EU on October 31st, with or without a deal, so we can begin to unite our country, restore trust in our politics, and move beyond Brexit to focus on delivering for everyone,” Mr. Johnson said on Tuesday.

"363"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-un-nearly-71-million-people-globally-are-displaced-by-war-and/"|"Michelle Zilio"|"The number of people forcibly displaced by war, conflict and persecution around the world topped a record-setting 70 million in 2018, including nearly 26 million refugees, according to a new report from the United Nations Refugee Agency. However, only 92,400 refugees permanently resettled in a new country, according to the annual global trends report from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The agency applauded Canada for welcoming nearly a third of the world’s resettled refugees – 28,100 people – and encouraged it to continue to set an international example amid the “toxic and misleading narratives against displaced people” around the world. “We need Canada more than ever,“ said Jean-Nicolas Beuze, the UNHCR’s representative in Canada, in an interview. “It’s an important signal to the rest of the world because it’s telling political leaders, but also opposition, that there’s a way to remain compassionate, there’s a way to remain engaged on these issues and address the fears the we hear among the public.” Mr. Beuze thanked Canadians for their generosity to refugees. Two-thirds of the resettled refugees who arrived in the country last year were privately sponsored by Canadian citizens, according to the UNHCR. Canada was the first country in the world to adopt a refugee system where private citizens and community groups can sponsor refugees from abroad; the program celebrated its 40th anniversary this year. Other governments have adopted similar models, but Mr. Beuze said Canada’s program needs to be replicated in more countries. For the first time, Canada resettled more refugees than the United States, which welcomed the second-largest number of refugees at 22,900 in 2018, according to the UNHCR. Other countries that accepted large numbers of resettled refugees included Australia at 12,700, Britain at 5,800 and France at 5,600. Refugees account for just over a third of people displaced around the world last year. The report found that another 41.3 million people were internally displaced in 2018, but are not considered refugees because they were not forced to flee their country. Over the past decade, the total number of forcibly displaced people has grown significantly from 43.3 million in 2009 to 70.8 million last year – the highest level since the Second World War. The likelihood of people being forcibly displaced has increased substantially in recent years, from 1-in-160 a decade ago to 1-in-108 in 2018. “What we are seeing in these figures is further confirmation of a longer-term rising trend in the number of people needing safety from war, conflict and persecution,” the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, said in the report. The report said most of the increase was driven by the Syrian civil war between 2012 and 2015, but conflicts in other countries, including Yemen, South Sudan, Myanmar and, most recently, Venezuela, have also contributed to the rise in the number of displaced people. Venezuela is home to what the UNHCR describes as the world’s fastest-growing displacement crisis, with more than four million people having fled the country since 2015. Venezuela has suffered economic collapse under President Nicolas Maduro, with inflation topping one million per cent. Widespread food and medicine shortages have led to a humanitarian crisis. Mr. Beuze called for global solidarity in finding solutions to the growing number of displaced people. He said western countries, including Canada, must take some of the burden off of nations hosting most of the world’s refugees, such as Lebanon and Bangladesh, by helping to resettle asylum seekers and find political solutions to crises. On average, high-income countries host 2.7 refugees per 1,000 people, compared to 5.8 in middle- and low-income countries, according to the UNHCR report. “We need more political will to resolve the root causes of displacement, whether it’s conflict, whether it’s a lack of development benefits, whether it’s discrimination between different groups in the countries of origin," Mr. Beuze said.

Mr. Corbyn, an instinctive critic of the European Union, has been under increasing pressure to back unequivocally a second referendum to satisfy many members and lawmakers in his party who say it is the only way to break the Brexit deadlock. He has previously showed his preference for a new national election, almost three years since Britain voted to leave the EU and left both his party and the governing Conservatives deeply split over how, when and whether Brexit should happen. Mr. Corbyn has come under fire for trying to keep both the “Leave” and “Remain” sides of the debate happy by not siding with either camp. His latest shift may ease strains for some, but for others it will be too little, too late. Addressing his top policy team, Mr. Corbyn set out his position more clearly than before: “I have already made the case … that it is now right to demand that any deal is put to a public vote. That is in line with our conference policy which agreed a public vote would be an option. “A ballot paper would need to contain real choices for both leave and remain voters. This will of course depend on Parliament,” he said in a statement. But in a sign that Labour’s discussion over Brexit is by no means complete, Mr. Corbyn also called on others in Labour and trade unions to express their views. “Then I want to set out our views in public,” he said. Mr. Corbyn, who led Labour to a much stronger than expected showing in a 2017 general election, has long wanted to move the conversation away from Brexit, seeing his anti-austerity message as a vote winner. But Labour and the Conservatives were punished in European elections last month, with many of their supporters either turning to a new movement led by veteran Euroskeptic Nigel Farage or the pro-EU message of the Liberal Democrats. That result has prompted soul-searching, with many Labour lawmakers saying the only way for the party to recover is to embrace a second referendum and then campaign to remain in the EU. Earlier, Mr. Corbyn’s spokesman declined to comment when asked whether Labour would campaign for Remain in any new vote. Chris Leslie, who left Labour to join an independent group, said Mr. Corbyn was playing his party’s members and lawmakers “for fools.” “Corbyn has delayed and prevaricated for so long, he’s run down the clock on Brexit,” he said on Twitter. “There’s maybe only eight parliamentary weeks left before crashing out!” Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day’s most important headlines.

State Rural Development Minister S.P. Velumani said on Wednesday that the drought followed a 62-per-cent shortfall in monsoon rains last year compared with 2017. People are lining up for water cans in the state capital of Chennai. Some companies have asked employees to work from home. Some restaurants are closing early and even considering not serving lunch if the water scarcity worsens. Gauri Shankar, general manager of Hotel Deccan Plaza in Chennai, said two tank trucks bring water to the hotel every day from a town 60 kilometres away at a cost of 4,000 rupees ($76) each. “Even a water tanker is proving difficult to get in the city. We are getting our supply because we entered into a contract with a supplier in September as the water taps started going dry,” the hotel manager said by phone. Chennai is India’s sixth-largest city with an estimated population of 10 million. It is a major destination for medical tourism, and Tamil Nadu state is a car manufacturing hub. Top elected official K. Palaniswami said the state has diminishing groundwater supplies and has asked other states for spare water until October’s monsoon rains. Monsoons reach different parts of India at different times. Northern and eastern India have experienced heatwaves with temperatures soaring to 48 C amid a delayed monsoon. At least 90 people have died due to heat stroke in the eastern state of Bihar since June, according to the state disaster management department. This year’s monsoon arrived in the southern state of Kerala a week late and slowly started moving to other parts of country. India is facing a 43 per cent shortfall in monsoon rains across the country because of its late arrival, according to the India Meteorological Department. Meteorologists said monsoon rains usually cover two-thirds of the country by mid-June. However, they currently have reached less than half that area. But the monsoon’s progress is expected to pick up in the next 10 days.

"366"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-limpet-mines-used-in-tanker-attack-resemble-ones-displayed-by-iran-u/"|"Aziz El Yaakoubi"|"The United States sought on Wednesday to bolster its case for isolating Iran over its nuclear and regional activities by displaying limpet mine fragments it said came from an oil tanker damaged in an attack last week and saying the ordnance looked Iranian in origin. Separately, a senior U.S. official said U.S. intelligence had confirmed that Iranian vessels had approached the damaged tanker, the Kokuka Courageous, as well as a second one, the Front Altair, prior to explosions that damaged their hulls last week. Iran has denied involvement in explosive strikes on those two tankers in the Gulf of Oman last week and on four tankers off the United Arab Emirates on May 12, both near the Strait of Hormuz, a major conduit for global oil supplies. But the incidents have fueled tensions that flared with the U.S. pullout last year from world powers’ 2015 nuclear accord with Iran, followed by fresh U.S. sanctions to stifle Tehran’s vital oil trade, and a retaliatory Iranian threat this week to breach limits on its nuclear activities imposed by the deal. Responding to Tehran’s move, Washington on Monday said it would deploy about 1,000 more troops to the Middle East on top of a 1,500-troop increase announced following the May tanker attacks. The Pentagon said the new deployment will include Patriot missiles as well as manned and unmanned surveillance aircraft. France and Germany said on Wednesday they would crank up efforts to halt any spiral toward conflict with Iran, but said time was running out and the risk of war could not be ruled out. Iran’s signal of preparedness to stockpile enriched uranium beyond the deal’s limit, and refine uranium to a fissile purity higher than deemed necessary for civilian uses, prompted U.S. President Donald Trump to warn on Tuesday he was ready to take military action to stop Tehran developing a nuclear bomb. The Islamic Republic denies having any such intentions. Mr. Trump also left open whether he would support the use of force to protect Gulf oil supplies that Washington fears might be put in jeopardy by Iran in the brewing confrontation. French President Emmanuel Macron’s office said his top diplomatic adviser, Emmanuel Bonne, went to Tehran on Wednesday for talks to help ease the crisis. Bonne has been based in Iran in the past and is a Middle East expert. Iran, where hard-line foes of detente with the West have been strengthened by Trump’s pressure campaign, said on Wednesday it would give European powers no more time beyond July 8 to save the nuclear deal by shielding its economy from U.S. sanctions. President Hassan Rouhani said Iran’s actions were the “minimum” Tehran could undertake one year after the Trump administration withdrew from the deal, but that its steps were reversible “if they return to their commitments.” Iran’s Foreign Ministry said later that senior diplomats from Iran, France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China - the remaining parties to the nuclear deal - would hold the next quarterly meeting of the accord’s oversight commission in Vienna, where the UN nuclear watchdog is based, on June 28. In the United Arab Emirates port of Fujairah on Wednesday, the U.S. Navy exhibited pieces of limpet mines and a magnet it said its personnel extracted from one of the two oil tankers attacked in the Gulf of Oman last week. The U.S. military earlier released images it said showed Iranian Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) removing an unexploded mine from the Japanese-owned tanker Kokuka Courageous, which was hit by blasts along with the Norwegian-owned Front Altair on June 13. “The limpet mine that was used in the attack is distinguishable and also strikingly bearing a resemblance to Iranian mines that have already been publicly displayed in Iranian military parades,” Sean Kido, commanding officer of an explosive ordnance dive and salvage task group in the U.S. Naval Forces Central Command (NAVCENT), told reporters. Small fragments said to have been removed from the Kokuka Courageous were on display alongside a magnet purportedly left by the Revolutionary Guard squad allegedly captured on video. The Japanese company that owns the Kokuka Courageous had said its ship was damaged by two “flying objects,” but NAVCENT dismissed this account. Kido also said NAVCENT had collected biometric information including fingerprints from the ship’s hull that would help in crafting a criminal case against the assailants. Separately, the U.S. special representative for Iran, Brian Hook, told U.S. lawmakers that “our intelligence confirms that Iranian vessels operating in and around the Strait of Hormuz on June 12th and 13th approached both the Front Altair and the Kokuka Courageous before each vessel suffered explosions.” “We assess this activity is consistent with an Iranian operation to attach limpet mines to the vessels,” he added, saying that “a senior IRGC official confirmed that personnel – IRGC personnel – had completed two actions.” He gave no information on which Iranian official he was quoting, when they spoke or why the “two actions” referred to the tanker attacks. In another incident likely to fan tensions, a rocket crashed onto a site in southern Iraq used by foreign oil companies on Wednesday, including U.S. energy giant ExxonMobil, wounding three people. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack near the southern Iraqi city of Basra - the fourth time in a week rockets have landed near U.S. installations. There were no casualties or major damage in the earlier incidents. An Iraqi security source said it appeared that Iran-backed groups in southern Iraq were behind Wednesday’s Basra incident. Iranian officials have made no comment about the attack but have denied all other allegations that Tehran has targeted energy tankers and facilities in the region.

"367"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-alleged-leader-of-nxivm-sex-cult-convicted-of-federal-charges/"|"Brendan Pierson"|"Keith Raniere, a New York man accused of running a cult-like group in which women were kept on starvation diets, branded with his initials and ordered to have sex with him, was found guilty of all charges against him by a New York jury on Wednesday. Mr. Raniere, 58, was charged with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, possession of child pornography and other crimes. He faces a possible sentence of life in prison. The jury in federal court in Brooklyn reached its verdict after just four hours of deliberation, capping off a trial that lasted more than six weeks. Mr. Raniere’s sentencing is set for Sept. 25. His lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, told reporters outside the courthouse that the verdict will be appealed. He said he believed a fair sentence would be less than life. How a secretive, cult-like group in upstate New York drew more than $100-million from two Bronfman daughters Seagram heiress Clare Bronfman, NXIVM co-founders plead not guilty Victims of alleged NXIVM sex cult seemed ‘broken,’ former member testifies Mr. Agnifilo also expressed sympathy for Mr. Raniere’s victims. “I hope that people find peace and solace in the verdict,” he said. “That’s my genuine feeling from the heart, having nothing to do with being anyone’s lawyer.” Mr. Raniere is the founder of Nxivm, a purported self-improvement organization based in upstate New York. Prosecutors said that he created a secret sorority within Nxivm called DOS in which female “slaves” turned over compromising materials, such as nude photos, that could be used for blackmail. They were told that the material would be released if they disobeyed orders or tried to leave, according to a former member and other witnesses. DOS was sold to recruits as an all-female organization, when in fact it was controlled by Mr. Raniere, according to former members who testified at the trial. Outside of the courthouse, after the verdict was read, a group of former Nxivm members gave the prosecution team a round of applause. Catherine Oxenberg, an actress who wrote a book called Captive about her efforts to rescue her daughter from Nxivm, called her daughter to tell her the verdict. “She’s in shock,” Ms. Oxenberg was heard saying of her daughter. “I’m in shock as well. It’s over. It’s done.” Mr. Raniere was the “grandmaster” of an inner circle of slaves, who in turn recruited slaves of their own. Some of those recruits were coerced into having sex with Mr. Raniere, and some were branded with his initials, according to former members. “The trial has revealed that Raniere, who portrayed himself as a savant and a genius, was in fact a master manipulator, a con man and the crime boss of a cult-like organization involving sex trafficking, child pornography, extortion, compelled abortion, branding, degradation and humiliation,” Richard Donoghue, the U.S. Attorney in Brooklyn, told reporters outside of the courthouse. “His crime, and the crimes of his co-conspirators, ruined marriages, careers, fortunes and lives.” Prosecutors also said that, years before creating DOS, Mr. Raniere began a sexual relationship with a 15-year-old girl. The child pornography charges stem from explicit pictures he took of the girl, who went on to become one of his inner circle of DOS slaves. Mr. Agnifilo, had told jurors in his closing arguments on Monday that no women were ever forced to do anything against their will. Other members of Nxivm, which is pronounced “nexium,” were charged alongside Mr. Raniere, and have all pleaded guilty. They include Nxivm president Nancy Salzman; her daughter, Lauren Salzman, who testified as the prosecution’s star witness; actress Allison Mack; and Seagram liquor heiress Claire Bronfman. The group first became known for its “Executive Success Program” courses, which purported to give students the ability to achieve their life goals by overcoming mental blocks. Witnesses testified that leaders of the organization psychologically manipulated and abused its members and demanded total obedience.

"368"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-britains-boris-johnson-increases-support-in-third-round-of/"|"Elizabeth Piper Andrew MacAskill"|"Brexit campaigner Boris Johnson cemented his position as the favourite to be Britain’s next prime minister on Wednesday after he increased his support in the third round of the Conservative Party leadership contest. Mr. Johnson got 143 out of 313 votes, with Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt in second place with 54 votes and Environment Secretary Michael Gove third with 51. Home Secretary Sajid Javid was fourth with 38 votes. International Development Secretary Rory Stewart managed only 27 votes and was eliminated from the contest. The remaining candidates will face two further votes on Thursday to whittle down the contest to the final two. Then Conservative Party grassroots members will decide who will become leader, and Britain’s next prime minister, by the end of July. “We’re gaining momentum,” said a source in the team running Mr. Johnson’s campaign. His lead makes Mr. Johnson, whose career has been marked by gaffes and scandals, the all but inevitable choice to replace Prime Minister Theresa May and take on Britain’s so far ill-fated negotiations to leave the European Union. The former foreign minister and London mayor has vowed to take Britain out of the EU by Oct. 31 no matter what, raising the prospect of a disorderly, or no-deal Brexit, which businesses say could harm the economy and investment. Almost three years since Britain voted to leave the EU, the country, Parliament and both main parties are deeply divided over how, when and even whether Brexit should happen. With a simple message similar to the sound bites he used in the 2016 referendum campaign, Mr. Johnson, who unlike other politicians is better known by his first name, has managed to persuade much of his party that only he can rescue it from electoral disaster by delivering Brexit. He won the support of one of earlier candidates, pro-Brexit lawmaker and former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab, who said Mr. Johnson would take Britain out of the EU by the end of October. “The only candidate who will now do this is Boris Johnson and so I’ll be supporting him to become our next Prime Minister,” he told the Evening Standard newspaper.

"369"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-hong-kong-lets-protesters-deadline-to-scrap-extradition-bill-pass/"|"Anne Marie Roantree"|"Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam appeared to ignore a Thursday deadline set by some protesters to withdraw an extradition bill that she promoted then postponed, setting the stage for a new wave of demonstrations in the Chinese-ruled city. Lam suspended the bill, which would allow criminal suspects in the former British colony to be extradited to mainland China for trial, but some student groups called on her to axe it altogether, setting the 5 p.m. (0900 GMT) deadline. They are also demanding that the government drop all charges against those arrested during last week’s protests, charge police with what they describe as violent action and stop referring to the protests as a riot. The activists pledged to surround the Legislative Council on Friday if their demands were not met, which would reignite tension in the financial hub and raise new questions about the Beijing-backed Lam’s ability to lead the city. A few dozen protesters gathered peacefully outside government headquarters on Thursday evening. Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997, since when it has been governed under a “one country, two systems” formula, allowing freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China, including a much-cherished independent judiciary. But many residents are increasingly unnerved by Beijing’s tightening grip over the city and what they see as an erosion of civil liberties. Courts on the mainland are controlled by the Communist Party. The bill prompted millions to take to the streets this month, triggering some of the most violent protests in decades as police fired rubber bullets and tear gas and marking the biggest challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he took power in 2012. Campaigners have registered thousands of new voters during the mass protests, pouncing on an opportunity to bolster the democratic opposition’s prospects in upcoming elections. The city’s pro-democracy camp needs a strong showing in city-wide legislative polls next year to recapture a big enough bloc to veto proposals from pro-establishment rivals, who now dominate the 70-seat legislature. Beijing has said it respects and supports Lam’s decision to suspend the extradition bill, but has been angered by criticism from Western capitals, including Washington, about the legislation. U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday threw her influence behind bipartisan legislation to require the Trump administration to certify Beijing is maintaining its special treatment of Hong Kong. China’s foreign ministry on Thursday again hit back at what it described as forces trying to destroy Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability. Lam has stopped short of saying the extradition bill will be withdrawn, stating only that it would not be introduced during her time in office if public concerns persist. She has apologized for the turmoil the bill has caused, saying she has heard the people “loud and clear,” although she rejected calls to step down. The Civil Human Rights Front, organizer of a protest on Sunday that it said attracted about 2 million people, is gearing up for an annual pro-democracy march on July 1, the 22nd anniversary of the handover. The group has called on people to turn out in force. The failure of pro-democracy protests in 2014 to wrestle concessions from Beijing, coupled with prosecutions of at least 100 protesters, had discouraged many young people from going back out on the streets – until this month.

"370"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-canadian-warship-sails-through-taiwan-strait/"|"Nathan VanderKlippe"|"Canada has sailed a frigate through the Taiwan Strait in what officials in Taipei called a freedom of navigation operation, the first since the arrest of a Huawei executive set off a deepening dispute between Ottawa and Beijing. The HMCS Regina, one Canada’s 12 frigates, sailed through the waters between Taiwan and China on Tuesday. It was accompanied by Naval Replenishment Unit Asterix. The two ships sailed from Cam Ranh Bay in Vietnam, where they made their first-ever call on a naval base there. “The most practical route between Cam Ranh Bay and Northeast Asia involves sailing through the Taiwan Strait,” Jessica Lamirande, spokesperson for Canada’s Department of National Defence, said in a statement. “Transit through the Taiwan Strait is not related to making any statement.” Another frigate, the HMCS Calgary, passed through the Taiwan Strait last October, the department said. But the Canadian naval transit, which is unlikely to please Beijing, forms “part of the new Canadian position towards China,” said Guy Saint-Jacques, the former Canadian ambassador to China, after the arrest of Huawei’s Meng Wanzhou and subsequent Chinese arrest of two Canadians, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor. Trade tensions with China to be a key topic during Trudeau’s talks with Trump ‘It would be a very dangerous precedent’: Freeland rejects Chrétien’s idea to cancel Meng’s extradition case Huawei and Canada: The story so far of the Chinese company, Meng Wanzhou’s case and a global political feud Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defence released a statement Wednesday that called the passage of the two Canadian ships a “freedom of navigation” operation. Taiwan’s state-owned Central News Agency also said that the HMCS Regina activated its automatic identification system during the transit, which allows the general public a view into its movements. Military ships often keep that system turned off to avoid advertising their position. “In terms of movement of ships, you don’t have to announce ahead of time what they are called. You just have to go through the strait, and it’s obvious what we are trying to demonstrate,” Mr. Saint-Jacques said. ”The Trudeau government is starting to assert itself more, and questions like freedom of navigation are important ones,” Mr. Saint-Jacques said. “It sends the signal that Canada is aligning with the U.S. and with other countries like Australia and France that have sent ships to the Taiwan Strait – that freedom of navigation is important and that we don’t recognize Chinese claims to sovereignty in that part of the world.” Taiwan is a self-ruling region with its own military and foreign policy that Beijing claims as part of its territory. China has repeatedly conducted military drills simulating the invasion of Taiwan, and in recent years has sent bombers on “encirclement” flights. Beijing has never ruled out the use of force to bring Taipei under its command. Earlier this year, the U.S. Defence Intelligence Agency called Taiwan a “primary driver for China’s military modernization.” In its 2019 China Military Power Report, the U.S. said “Beijing’s anticipation that foreign forces would intervene in a Taiwan scenario led the PLA to develop a range of systems to deter and deny foreign regional force projection,” the report states. The PLA is China’s People’s Liberation Army. The U.S. regularly sends its own naval vessels through the Taiwan Strait, including most recently on May 22. A French frigate also passed through the waters in April, an unusual voyage for a European military ship. Beijing typically responds with anger at those movements, calling them illegal and lodging diplomatic complaints. Canada’s military has taken a more active role in Asia in recent years, including sending a submarine and two frigates to the region last year to “build relationships, work with trusted international partners, and contribute to multinational efforts to counter North Korea’s maritime smuggling activity while in the region,” Ms. Lamirande said.

"371"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-chinese-court-says-former-interpol-president-confessed-to-accepting/"|"Christopher Bodeen"|"Former Interpol president Meng Hongwei confessed to accepting more than $2-million in bribes and expressed regret for his crime, a Chinese court said Thursday. The No. 1 Intermediate Court in the northeastern port city of Tianjin said Meng read a statement containing the confession at a hearing. That assures a conviction, although it isn’t immediately clear when a verdict and sentence will be handed down. Admitting guilt and expressing regret can result in slightly lighter punishment, although China has been quick to hand out life sentences as it cracks down on corruption and political disloyalty under a campaign run directly by the president and head of the ruling Communist Party, Xi Jinping. Meng, who was elected president of the international police organization in 2016, disappeared into custody while visiting China from France at the end of September. Interpol was not informed of Meng’s detention and was forced to ask China about his whereabouts. The Tianjin court said Meng had abused his positions, including as a vice minister of public security and maritime police chief, to curry favour for others in return for bribes. Meng, 65, was shown on television wearing a plain brown windbreaker and flanked by two bailiffs. He appeared older and greyer than during his time as one of the nation’s top law enforcement officers. He has already been fired from his positions and expelled from the Communist Party. While serving at Interpol, Meng retained his title as vice minister of public security. There are suspicions he fell out of political favour with Xi, who has come down hard on corruption and perceived disloyalty in what observers say is a campaign calculated to strengthen party control while bringing down potential challengers to his authority. Meng’s wife, Grace, has remained in France, where Meng was stationed for the Lyon-based Interpol, and has accused Chinese authorities of creating a “fake case” against him for political reasons. On Thursday, Grace Meng questioned whether Meng was even alive, saying she was not certain the figure who appeared on TV was her husband. “I love him, trust him, respect him and am proud of him,” she told The Associated Press. “No matter how they insult him or frame him, they can’t change the facts: He is worthy of his motherland, worthy of police honour, and worthy of the people who love him. “The international community will know the truth,” she said.

Paul Whelan, who holds U.S., British, Canadian and Irish passports, was detained in a Moscow hotel room on Dec. 28 and accused of espionage, a charge he denies. If found guilty, he faces up to 20 years in jail. Whelan said last month that he had been threatened by a Russian investigator in custody and harassed, accusations that added to strains in U.S.-Russian relations. “Mr president (Trump), we cannot keep America great unless we aggressively protect and defend American citizens wherever they are in the world,” Whelan told reporters at a hearing in Moscow on Thursday. “I am asking the leaders and governments in Ottawa, Dublin, London and Washington for their help and public statements of support,” he said, standing inside a glass cage. Whelan’s lawyer has said his client was framed and that he was given a flash drive by an acquaintance that he thought contained holiday photos, but that actually held classified information.

"373"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-chinas-president-xi-arrives-in-north-korea/"|"Ben Blanchard"|"The world hopes North Korea and the United States can talk to each other and for those talks to be successful, Chinese President Xi Jinping told North Korean leader Kim Jong-un on Thursday, praising Pyongyang’s efforts toward denuclearization. Xi is visiting China’s reclusive neighbour North Korea, seeking to bolster a long-time ally hit by UN sanctions over its nuclear and missile programmes, a week before Xi and U.S. President Donald Trump meet amid a bitter trade dispute. Xi, whose entourage includes the head of China’s state economic planner, will be in North Korea for two days, the first Chinese leader to visit in 14 years, and could bring fresh support measures for its floundering, sanctions-bound economy. Kim Jong-un and his wife, Ri Sol Ju, greeted Xi at the airport, Chinese state TV said. Kim’s sister, Kim Yo Jong, and officials who played prominent roles in recent nuclear talks with the United States were also on hand. Xi was driven through Pyongyang in a convertible car, standing with Kim at his side, and greeted warmly by massed, cheering crowds on his way to the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, a complex that serves as the mausoleum for North Korea’s founder, Kim Il Sung, the report said. Xi told Kim he had come to consolidate a traditional friendship and to promote the political process for a resolution of the Korean peninsula issue, it added. Xi “positively appraised” North Korea’s efforts to safeguard peace and stability on the peninsula and promote denuclearization, state television said. “The situation on the Korean peninsula concerns regional peace and stability,” the report paraphrased Xi as telling Kim at their formal meeting. “The international community hopes that North Korea and the United States can talk and for the talks to get results.” Since a failed summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim in Hanoi earlier this year, Pyongyang has resumed some weapons tests and warned of “truly undesired consequences” if the United States is not more flexible. China is willing to provide what help it can to resolve North Korea’s reasonable security and development concerns, Xi said. Kim told Xi that in the last year or so North Korea had taken many positive steps to avoid tensions. “But these didn’t get a positive response from the relevant side. This is not something North Korea wished to see,” Chinese television cited Kim as saying. “North Korea is willing to exercise patience, and at the same time hopes the relevant side can meet North Korea halfway, seek a solution that accords with both sides’ reasonable concerns, and promote results for the talks process of the peninsula issue.” China is the North’s only major ally and the visit comes amid renewed tension on the Korean peninsula as the United States seeks to persuade Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons, which it pursued for years in defiance of UN Security Council resolutions. The trip is also an assertion of a key leverage point that China has in its deteriorating relationship with the United States, diplomats say. “Comrade Xi Jinping is visiting … in the face of crucial and grave tasks due to complex international relations, which clearly shows the Chinese party and the government place high significance on the friendship,” the North’s official Rodong Sinmun newspaper said. The trip highlights two-way ties that “never waver despite any headwinds,” and strengthens “blood ties” between the two peoples, it added in a front-page commentary. Xi is also expected to pay tribute at the Friendship Tower, which commemorates Chinese troops who fought together with North Koreans during the 1950-53 Korean War. The conflict ended in a truce, not a treaty, leaving the North technically still at war with South Korea. Xi and Kim will meet just a week before a G20 summit in Osaka where Xi and Trump are due to meet in a bid to reset ties poisoned by a bitter trade dispute. The timing of Xi’s visit to North Korea was no accident, said Li Zhonglin, a North Korea expert at China’s Yanbian University. China could be hoping to play a role in coaxing the North and the United States to resume denuclearization talks after this year’s failed Kim-Trump summit in Hanoi, he added. “President Xi’s visit to North Korea can play a positive role in bringing about a third U.S.-North Korea summit,” Li said. “China wants a breakthrough.” Kim has visited Xi in China four times since last year, and China has praised North Korea and the United States for trying to resolve their issues through dialogue rather than threats of force or military posturing. While China has signed up to UN sanctions for the North’s repeated nuclear and missile tests, saying it is enforcing them fully, despite some U.S. doubts, it has also suggested sanctions relief. China has also defended its “normal” trade and business ties with North Korea. This week, in a rare honour afforded a foreign leader, Xi wrote in the Rodong Sinmun newspaper that China supported North Korea’s “correct direction” in politically resolving issues on the Korean peninsula. China has also suggested the tough sanctions on the North could be eased if it abides by UN resolutions. With fuel imports limited and most major exports banned, the sanctions appear to be hurting the North’s economy. State media say drought has hit North Korea, with international aid groups reporting food production dropping dramatically amid poor harvests.

Trump has said he expects to meet Putin at a G20 summit in Osaka, Japan, next week, though Moscow has so far said it has yet to receive a formal invitation for such talks. U.S.-Russia ties remain strained by everything from Syria to Ukraine and Venezuela, as well as by allegations of Russian interference in U.S. politics, which Moscow denies. Putin said this month that relations between Moscow and Washington were getting worse and worse. “Dialogue is always good, there’s always demand for it,” said Putin during his annual question-and-answer session when quizzed about talks with Trump. “Sure, if the American side shows interest … we are ready for dialogue.” The Russian leader said the two countries had a lot to talk about, including strategic nuclear stability. A landmark arms control treaty is coming up for renewal, while both sides have said they are quitting the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, stoking fears of a wider arms race. Putin said Trump’s drive to win another presidential term might complicate the situation, however. “We all understand and see what is going on in domestic politics in the United States,” said Putin. “Even if the president wants to take steps towards us, wants to talk about anything, there are a huge number of limitations. “Even more so now as the current head of state will make all his statements with his election campaign in mind. He has already started the campaign, so everything will not be simple in our relations,” Putin said. The Russian leader said talks, if they took place, could help re-establish what he called normal relations between Russia and the United States, including on the economy. He also said he wanted the two countries to talks about cybersecurity.

"375"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-britain-broke-law-by-allowing-arms-sales-to-saudi-arabia-court-rules/"|"Paul Sandle Guy Faulconbridge"|"Britain broke the law by allowing arms sales to Saudi Arabia that might have been deployed in the war in Yemen, an English court ruled on Thursday after activists said there was evidence the weapons had been used in violation of human rights statutes. While the court’s decision does not mean Britain must immediately halt arms exports to Saudi Arabia, it does mean that there is a stay on the granting of new export licenses to sell arms to the kingdom – Britain’s biggest weapons purchaser. The United Nations has described the conflict in Yemen, which has killed tens of thousands of people including thousands of civilians, as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. “The Court of Appeal has concluded that the process of decision-making by the government was wrong in law in one significant respect,” said Terence Etherton, England’s second most senior judge. Handing down the ruling, Etherton said the government made “no concluded assessments of whether the Saudi-led coalition had committed violations of international humanitarian law in the past, during the Yemen conflict.” International Trade Minister Liam Fox said he disagreed with the judgment and would seek permission to appeal. “Alongside this we are carefully considering the implications of the judgment for decision making,” Fox said. “While we do this we will not grant any new licenses for export to Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners which might be used in the conflict in Yemen.” Britain is the world’s sixth largest seller of arms, after the United States, Russia, France, Germany and China, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). A senior U.S. State Department official declined to comment on the court ruling, but said both the United States and Britain had long-standing, deeply rooted security ties to Saudi Arabia, despite what he called certain “difficult situations.” “They are carrying a significant amount of equity to protect U.S. interests and U.S. persons, and it is incumbent upon us to stand shoulder to shoulder with our partners, especially when they are on the front line for our interests,” he said. The U.S. Senate also voted to back two resolutions opposing President Donald Trump’s plan to complete weapons sales to Saudi Arabia and other countries. Saudi Arabia accounted for 43 per cent of Britain’s global arms sales in the past decade. BAE Systems, Britain’s biggest defence company, generates 14 per cent, or around 2.6 billion pounds ($3.3-billion), of its group sales from Saudi. “We continue to support the U.K. Government in providing equipment, support and training under government-to-government agreements between the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia,” a spokesman for BAE Systems said in a statement. The British government is negotiating a multi-billion-pound deal to sell Saudi Arabia 48 new Typhoon fighter jets, but the deal has been held up by an embargo imposed by Germany, whose firms account for about a third of the content on the aircraft. The legal action against the British government was brought by the Campaign Against the Arms Trade, which wants to end the global arms trade and argued that British weapons were likely to have been used in Yemen in violation of human rights law. A Western-backed alliance led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates intervened in Yemen in 2015 to try to restore the internationally-recognised government to power after the Iran-aligned Houthis seized the capital, claiming to fight graft. Saudi Arabia’s minister of state for foreign affairs, Adel al-Jubeir, said Iran would be the only beneficiary of cutting off arms exports to the kingdom or its regional allies. “The coalition is fighting a legitimate war at the behest of a legitimate government to stop Iran and its proxies from taking over a strategically important country – so the only beneficiary of a cut-off of weapons to the coalition is going to be Iran,” Jubeir told reporters in London. The war has left tens of thousands of people including civilians and children dead, and has put 10 million people at risk of famine and the world’s worst cholera epidemic. “The decision of the court today does not mean that license to export arms to Saudi Arabia must immediately be suspended,” said Etherton, the British judge. “It does mean that the U.K. government must reconsider the matter, must make the necessary assessments about past episodes of concern, allowing for the fact that, in some cases, it will not be possible to reach a conclusion.” Rights groups and Britain’s opposition Labour Party welcomed the judgment. Labour said British ministers had wilfully disregarded evidence that Saudi Arabia was violating international humanitarian law in Yemen, while nevertheless continuing to supply Riyadh with weapons. “U.K. advice, assistance and arms supplies to Saudi’s war in Yemen is a moral stain on our country,” Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said. “Arms sales to Saudi must stop now.” Fox, the trade minister, said Britain had always taken its export control obligations very seriously and would continue to do so. “Our whole assessment has been infused with IHL (international humanitarian law) considerations, indeed everything was looked at through the prism of IHL,” he said.

The two countries disputed the circumstances leading up to an Iranian surface-to-air missile bringing down the U.S. Navy RQ-4A Global Hawk, an unmanned aircraft with a wingspan larger than a Boeing 737 jetliner and costing over $100-million. Iran said the drone “violated” its territorial airspace, while the U.S. called the missile fire “an unprovoked attack” in international airspace over the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf and President Donald Trump tweeted that “Iran made a very big mistake!” Trump later appeared to play down the incident, telling reporters in the Oval Office that he had a feeling that “a general or somebody” being “loose and stupid” made a mistake in shooting down the drone. Brent crude jumps 3% to $63 as Iran shoots down U.S. drone in Gulf Houthis rebels in Yemen hit Saudi Arabian power station with cruise missile Trump officials to Congress: Iran has ties to al-Qaida Iran-U.S. tensions and the Gulf of Oman: A guide to the story so far The incident immediately heightened the crisis already gripping the wider region, which is rooted in Trump withdrawing the U.S. a year ago from Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal and imposing crippling new sanctions on Tehran. Recently, Iran quadrupled its production of low-enriched uranium to be on pace to break one of the deal’s terms by next week while threatening to raise enrichment closer to weapons-grade levels on July 7 if Europe doesn’t offer it a new deal. Citing unspecified Iranian threats, the U.S. has sent an aircraft carrier to the Middle East and deployed additional troops alongside the tens of thousands already there. All this has raised fears that a miscalculation or further rise in tensions could push the U.S. and Iran into an open conflict 40 years after Tehran’s Islamic Revolution. “We do not have any intention for war with any country, but we are fully ready for war,” Revolutionary Guard commander Gen. Hossein Salami said in a televised address. The paramilitary Guard, which answers only to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said it shot down the drone at 4:05 a.m. Thursday when it entered Iranian airspace near the Kouhmobarak district in southern Iran’s Hormozgan province. Kouhmobarak is about 1,200 kilometres (750 miles) southeast of Tehran. The drone took off from the southern Persian Gulf and collected data from Iranian territory, including the southern port of Chahbahar near Iran’s border with Pakistan, the Guard said in comments that appeared aimed at showing it could track the aircraft. The U.S. military has not commented on the mission of the remotely piloted aircraft that can fly higher than 10 miles in altitude and stay in the air for over 24 hours at a time. Iran used its air defence system known as Third of Khordad to shoot down the drone – a truck-based missile system that can fire up to 18 miles (30 kilometres) into the sky, the semi-official Fars news agency reported. Iranian state TV later broadcast video it described as the moment the Guard launched the surface-to-air missile that struck the U.S. drone. Chants of “God is great!” could be heard as a fireball appeared in the darkened sky. Typically, militaries worldwide call out to errant aircraft entering their airspace before firing. It’s unclear whether Iran gave any warning before opening fire. The U.S. military says Iran fired on and missed another drone last week near the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which 20 per cent of all global oil moves. The U.S. has been worried about international shipping through the strategic waterway since tankers were damaged in May and June in what Washington has blamed on limpet mines from Iran, although Tehran denied involvement. On Wednesday in the United Arab Emirates, the U.S. Navy showed fragments of mines that it said bore “a striking resemblance” to those seen in Iran The RQ-4 Global Hawk was at least 34 kilometres from Iranian territory when it was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile, said Air Force Lt. Gen. Joseph Guastella, commander of the U.S. Central Command. He said it was an attempt to disrupt U.S. efforts to monitor the Persian Gulf region. But Salami, speaking to a crowd in the western city of Sanandaj, described the American drone as “violating our national security border.” “Borders are our red line,” the Revolutionary Guard general said. “Any enemy that violates the borders will be annihilated.” Iran’s Foreign Ministry also said the drone entered Iranian airspace, and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted it would take its case to the UN He later tweeted that Iran retrieved parts of the drone in its territorial waters. Russian President Vladimir Putin urged caution, warning any war between Iran and the U.S. would be a “catastrophe for the region as a minimum.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged support for U.S. efforts to halt what he called escalating Iranian provocations. “In the last 24 hours, Iran has intensified its aggression against the United States and against all of us,” he said. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed concern and urged all parties to “avoid any action that could inflame the situation,” said UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric. America stations some RQ-4 Global Hawks at the Al-Dhafra Air Base in the UAE, near the capital of Abu Dhabi. Associated Press journalists saw the drones on the base’s tarmac during a March 2016 visit by then-Vice-President Joe Biden. The U.S. military occasionally publishes images from there of the drones, which have a distinctive hump-shaped front and an engine atop the fuselage. Iran has claimed to have shot down U.S. drones before. In the most famous incident, in December 2011, Iran seized an RQ-170 Sentinel flown by the CIA to monitor Iranian nuclear sites after it entered Iranian airspace from neighbouring Afghanistan. Iran later reverse-engineered the drone to create their own variants. Elsewhere in the region Thursday, Saudi Arabia said Yemen’s Iranian-backed Houthi rebels fired a rocket at a desalination plant in al-Shuqaiq, a city in the kingdom’s Jizan province. The state-run Saudi Press Agency quoted military spokesman Col. Turki al-Maliki as saying it caused no damage or casualties. The Yemeni rebel Al-Masirah satellite news channel earlier said the Houthis targeted a power plant in Jizan, near the kingdom’s border with Yemen, with a cruise missile. A coalition led by Saudi Arabia, a key U.S. ally, has been battling the Houthis since March 2015 in Yemen, the Arab world’s poorest nation now pushed to the brink of famine by the conflict. In recent weeks, the Houthis have launched a new campaign sending missiles and bomb-laden drones into Saudi Arabia.

Best known for his floppy hair, frumpy suits and verbal slip ups, Mr. Johnson easily won the last in a series of votes among fellow Tory MPs on Thursday that reduced the number of candidates to replace Theresa May as Conservative leader and prime minister to two from 10. Mr. Johnson took 160 out of 313 votes in the final ballot, and will face the second-place finisher, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who had the support of 77 MPs. About 160,000 party members will choose the new leader in a mail-in vote next month. The winner is expected to take over from Ms. May in late July. Polls show Mr. Johnson with about 70 per cent support among members compared with 26 per cent for Mr. Hunt. Mr. Johnson would face a daunting task should he become prime minister. The United Kingdom is scheduled to leave the EU on Oct. 31, but despite nearly three years of negotiations, still has no agreement on the terms of its departure or any deal on future trade relations. Mr. Johnson has been a fierce critic of Ms. May’s Brexit strategy, including a deal she struck with the EU last year. He resigned as foreign secretary over Ms. May’s approach and once described her agreement with the EU as a “suicide vest” that would destroy the country. His attacks contributed to Ms. May’s downfall, and she was forced out as party leader last month after failing three times to win parliamentary approval for her agreement. The inability to deliver Brexit has hurt the Conservatives, and support for the party has plummeted in most opinion polls. The Tories finished fifth in recent elections to the European Parliament and suffered huge setbacks in local elections in May. The main threat has come from the newly created Brexit Party led by Nigel Farage, who has campaigned for the United Kingdom to leave the EU without a deal and trade with the bloc on World Trade Organization terms. Bank of England chops second quarter growth view as global and Brexit risks intensify Before sneering at Trump, Britons should take a long, hard look in the mirror The race for Britain’s next prime minister is on: Who’s vying for the Tory leadership Many Tory members see Mr. Johnson as a credible rival to Mr. Farage, and someone who can reinvigorate the party. He’s a colourful campaigner who won two terms as mayor of London despite strong opposition from the Labour Party. He also has solid credentials as a “Brexiteer,” having co-chaired the Vote Leave campaign during the 2016 EU referendum, in which 52 per cent of voters backed Brexit. Conservative Party members are even more pro-Brexit than the public, with polls showing 72 per cent voted leave in 2016 and 57 per cent support exiting without a deal. Mr. Johnson has tapped into that pro-Brexit sentiment by insisting during the leadership race that he would lead the country out of the EU on Oct. 31 with or without a deal. He has also said he would withhold £39-billion ($65.4-billion) the country owes the EU to push for an agreement. However, he hasn’t produced any details on how he would succeed where Ms. May failed, and during a televised debate on Tuesday, he softened his position somewhat, saying that leaving on Oct. 31 was “eminently feasible.” He also refused to guarantee the country would leave then. EU officials say Ms. May’s deal cannot be changed, and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte on Thursday urged Mr. Johnson to rethink his position. “I hope that [the] campaign is done in poetry, and governing is in prose, as I think Churchill said once,” Mr. Rutte told the BBC before a summit of EU leaders in Brussels. “With a hard Brexit, even with a normal Brexit, the U.K. will be a different country. It will be a diminished country. It is unavoidable.” Mr. Hunt, a long-time cabinet minister, has been less clear-cut about Brexit. He voted for the United Kingdom to remain in the EU in 2016, but he has become a convert, and indicated recently that he was prepared to take the country out of the EU without a deal. However, he has also said he would delay Brexit if an agreement could be struck. Mr. Johnson has a history of gaffes. As foreign secretary, he made an ill-timed comment about a British-Iranian woman being held in Iran as a spy, prompting an extension to her prison term. Last year, he wrote in a newspaper column that Muslim women who wore burkas looked like “letter boxes,” and was famously and profanely dismissive of business leaders who decried a no-deal Brexit.

Her family and the Canadian embassy in Kabul have been informed. Miriam Lindsay, 41, from Maple Grove, Que., was on her way home around midnight local time when her car was hit by another vehicle. An Afghan man in the car also died. Two other male passengers were injured. Ms. Lindsay had been working for the Afghan aid agency Youth Health and Development Organization (YHDO) and had been living in Afghanistan for more than three years. “I was informed about the accident at 4 a.m. and contacted her family immediately via text message,” said YHDO executive director Abdul Rasheed, whose team went to Isteqlal Hospital in West Kabul to identify Ms. Lindsay. Dr. Rasheed has since spoken to the family on the phone. The bodies of Ms. Lindsay and the male victim have since been taken to Kabul’s forensic-medicine hospital for examination. “She was kind and loved the Afghan people and always stood up for them,” said Dr. Rasheed of Ms. Lindsay, who worked as a technical manager for the organization. “She was very much in touch with our culture and strongly believed in humanitarian principles. She had a good life in Canada but continued to choose to work here in Afghanistan,” he said. Dr. Rasheed said arrangements for repatriation through the Canadian embassy are being made. According to her sisters Kim and Iris, Ms. Lindsay was courageous, loving and brilliant. She began her career as a humanitarian in Bolivia after studying agriculture. A keen sense of organization and the ability to learn quickly helped her travel the world to countries like Angola, Yemen and Afghanistan, always helping marginalized and downtrodden people on her journeys, they said. “We’ll remember her as someone who gave her life to help people where the need was greater," Iris said. "She believed in the work she was doing to help those who needed it most.” Ms. Lindsay often worked in countries considered dangerous. In 2017, she survived a bombing in Kabul that killed 90 people and wounded more than 450 others. She was in a nearby store when the blast rang out, shattering the door and windows of the shop. “Living here is dangerous,” she told Radio-Canada in the hours after the attack. “We know, so we accept some risks. Is it lack of awareness, or devotion? I do not know.” Ms. Lindsay was due to fly home next week to visit her family, and last Saturday had posted a photo of her hometown on Facebook, captioning it, “My village. Just can’t wait to be there.” Her sister Kim was going to pick her up at the airport. “She loved being surrounded by people,” Kim said through tears. “She was versatile and able to adapt. … At the same time she was very fragile with a very big heart. But she was an impressive person, a complex person.” With a report from Matthew Lapierre in Toronto.

"382"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-georgias-president-calls-russia-an-enemy-and-occupier-suggests/"|"Margarita Antidze Andrew Osborn"|"Georgia and Russia traded blame on Friday for an outbreak of unrest in Tbilisi sparked by the visit of a Russian lawmaker with the Kremlin announcing it would suspend passenger flights between the two countries to protect its citizens. Georgian President Salome Zurabishvili had earlier blamed Moscow for the unrest, suggesting a “fifth column” loyal to Moscow had stirred up trouble, an allegation Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev dismissed as a distortion of reality. Violence flared in the Georgian capital late on Thursday, where police used tear gas and rubber bullets to stop crowds furious about the visit of a Russian delegation from storming parliament. Hundreds of people, both protesters and police officers, were injured, some seriously, as demonstrators pushed against lines of riot police, threw bottles and stones, and grabbed shields, drawing a tough response. Though ostensibly about how Georgia handles relations with Russia, with whom it fought and lost a brief war in 2008, opposition parties have sought to seize the moment to press much wider and unrelated demands and called on people to take to the streets again on Friday evening. Thousands gathered outside parliament where opposition leaders gave the floor to young activists and students. “We are here to show our anger and our readiness to change this country,” one of the activists said. Police were present, though not in large numbers, and the protest, unlike Thursday’s demonstration, was peaceful. The speaker of parliament, Irakli Kobakhidze, resigned earlier on Friday, satisfying one of the protesters’ demands. A coalition of opposition parties has demanded the interior minister’s resignation as well, the release of detained protesters, and talks on holding an early parliamentary election. Tamar Kordzaia, leader of the opposition Republican Party, said protests would continue to press those demands. Tensions between Moscow and Tbilisi are running high and President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on Friday suspending Russian passenger flights from Russia to Georgia from July 8 to protect people from what the Kremlin called criminal actions. Putin also recommended Russian travel agencies suspend tours to Georgia and ordered the government to bring Russian tourists already there home. Over 1 million Russian tourists holiday in Georgia each year. Georgian President Zurabishvili had earlier called Russia “an enemy and occupier” and suggested Moscow had helped trigger Thursday’s protests. “Russia is our enemy and occupier. The fifth column it manages may be more dangerous than open aggression,” Zurabishvili posted on her Facebook page. Medvedev said Zurabishvili either didn’t know what she was talking about or was wilfully distorting the situation, while the Kremlin blamed radical Georgian politicians for what it called “an anti-Russian provocation.” Russian influence in Georgia remains a politically sensitive subject, with the opposition accusing the ruling Georgian Dream party – which backed Zurabishvili for the presidency late last year – of being too meek when it comes to confronting Moscow. The small south Caucasus nation, a U.S. ally, fought and lost a short war against Moscow in 2008. The two countries have not had diplomatic ties since, and Russia went on to recognize the independence of two breakaway Georgian regions, South Ossetia and Abkhazia, where Russian troops are now garrisoned. Protesters remain angry about the visit of a Russian delegation led by Sergei Gavrilov, a member of Russia’s lower house of parliament, which was taking part in an event designed to foster relations between Orthodox Christian lawmakers on Thursday. Gavrilov addressed delegates in his native Russian from the Georgian parliamentary speaker’s seat, angering some Georgian politicians and citizens who want Russia kept at arm’s length. Gavrilov told a Moscow news conference on Friday he believed the protests had been preplanned. “Our common view is that there’s an obvious attempt in Georgia right now to stage a coup d’etat and that extremist forces are trying to seize power,” he said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the safety of Gavrilov and other members of the Russian delegation had been endangered. “Everything that happened yesterday in Georgia is nothing other than an anti-Russian provocation,” said Peskov. Georgia, criss-crossed by energy pipelines, hopes one day to join the European Union and NATO, an ambition which has infuriated Moscow, the country’s former Soviet overlord.

"383"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-eu-rules-out-reopening-brexit-deal-with-whoever-succeeds-britains/"|"Raf Casert Pan Pylas"|"The European Union insisted Friday that it will not reopen the Brexit withdrawal agreement with whoever succeeds Theresa May as British prime minister. Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the EU’s executive European Commission, said the bloc’s leaders were unanimous in the view that the Brexit deal, which has been rejected three times by the British Parliament, should not be reopened. “We repeated unanimously that there will be no renegotiating of the withdrawal agreement,” Mr. Juncker said in Brussels after a meeting of EU leaders, excluding Ms. May. He said the 27 leaders will rebuff any call from Ms. May’s successor next month to restart the Brexit negotiations over the withdrawal agreement that deals with citizens’ rights, the Irish border and how much money Britain owes the EU. Donald Tusk, who is President of the European Council and chairs meetings of EU leaders, said there could be tweaks to the political declaration that accompanies the legally watertight withdrawal agreement. The declaration is vaguer but deals with a range of other matters including the outlines of a future trade relationship between the EU and the United Kingdom. Britain was originally set to leave the EU on March 29 but because of the British Parliament’s failure to back the deal that May agreed with the EU, it has been granted an extension until Oct. 31. Given that so much time has elapsed with little progress, it is likely that Brexit will have to be delayed further. However, some EU leaders said any new extension should only be granted to hold general elections in Britain or a new Brexit referendum. “It’s not possible [that] because you change the leader in the U.K. that we need to postpone decisions,” said Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel. Worries of a “no-deal” Brexit have swelled during the race to succeed Ms. May. Boris Johnson, the favourite to prevail in the election of Conservative Party members next month, has indicated that he’s prepared to go ahead with a “no-deal” Brexit. Most economists think a sharp rupture with the EU, which accounts for about 50 per cent of Britain’s trade, will lead to a deep recession. On Thursday, British Treasury chief Philip Hammond said a “no-deal” Brexit would damage the British economy and ultimately risk the breakup of the U.K., a reference to tensions in Scotland and Northern Ireland, both of which voted to stay in the EU. The head of the Bank of England on Friday dismissed suggestions from Mr. Johnson that tariffs on trade with the EU can be avoided even if the country leaves the bloc without a withdrawal agreement. Mr. Johnson has said Britain can rely on a provision in international trade rules to make sure trade relations remain unchanged. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney told the BBC that would not be possible if there is no deal between the EU and Britain. He said the legal provision – in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade – “applies if you have an agreement, not if you have decided not to have an agreement or have been unable to come to an agreement.” Mr. Carney says Britain would automatically be hit by tariffs as the Europeans would have to apply the same rules to Britain as it does to every other country outside the tariff-free EU. “If they were to decide not to put in place tariffs, they will also have to lower tariffs with the United States, with the rest of the world,” he said. “And the same would hold for us.” Mr. Carney indicated there’s only so much firms can do to offset the impact of tariffs. Three-quarters of British companies, he said, have done as much as they can, which in some cases may not be much. Firms built up stocks in the run-up to the initial Brexit deadline of March 29 to be able to continue to operate in case of a “no-deal” Brexit, but that only covers a few weeks, Mr. Carney said. Businesses are far more dependent on what the government can do to keep ports open and trade flowing. “No deal means no deal. It means a substantial change in the trading relationship with the European Union,” he said. “That may be the choice the country takes but it’s a choice that should be taken with absolute clarity in terms of what that means.” Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day’s most important headlines.

"384"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-chinas-xi-jinping-pushes-economic-reform-at-north-korea-summit/"|"Christopher Bodeen"|"Chinese President Xi Jinping offered encouragement for North Korea’s focus on economic development in a speech in Pyongyang, turning to a topic Beijing has long pressed with its Communist neighbour amid wider concerns over the North’s nuclear weapons program. In an address at a banquet Thursday night, Mr. Xi noted that the country under leader Kim Jong-un had “initiated a new strategic line of economic development and improving people’s livelihoods, raising socialist construction in the country to a new high tide,” according to China’s official Xinhua News Agency. Mr. Xi left North Korea early Friday afternoon, Chinese state media reported. An image posted on the mobile app of state broadcaster CCTV showed people waving at his Air China Boeing 747 on the tarmac at the airport in Pyongyang. Before leaving, Mr. Xi, accompanied by Mr. Kim and their wives, laid a wreath at a memorial to Chinese soldiers killed in the 1950-53 Korean War. China’s intervention in the conflict prevented a rout of North Korean forces by troops from the United States and others under United Nations command. “We will pass down the China-North Korea friendship from generation to generation, consolidate and develop the two countries’ socialist cause, better enrich our citizens and advance regional peace, stability, development and prosperity,” Mr. Xi was quoted as saying. The North’s long-moribund economy has shown some recent improvements, but it remains heavily dependent on aid – mainly from China – and food security is a constant concern. China has agreed to UN economic sanctions over the North’s nuclear and missile programs but is wary of any measures that could push its economy toward collapse, potentially unleashing instability and chaos on its border. Mr. Xi’s speech also touched on the nuclear issue, saying all sides agreed to “stick to peace talks so as to make even greater contributions to peace, stability and prosperity in the region and the wider world,” Xinhua said. North Korean state-media said Friday that Mr. Xi and Mr. Kim held broad discussions over the political situation surrounding the Korean Peninsula and reached a shared understanding on the issues they discussed. The Korean Central News Agency report did not give any specifics on the stalled nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang over disagreements in exchanging sanctions relief for disarmament. “The supreme leaders … broadly exchanged their opinions on the political situation of the Korean Peninsula and other serious international and regional issues,” KCNA said. They assessed that deepening their relationship was in line with the “mutual interest of the two countries in face of serious and complicated changes in the environment and would be favourable for the region’s peace, stability and development,” it said. In South Korea, the presidential Blue House welcomed Mr. Xi’s visit to North Korea, saying it believes his talks with Mr. Kim will help promote peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. Mr. Kim told Mr. Xi on Thursday that he has not received a desired response from Washington and that the United States should meet North Korea halfway to “explore resolution plans that accommodate each other’s reasonable concerns,” according to Chinese state media. Mr. Xi said his government is willing to play a constructive role in the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. “The international community expects the U.S. and North Korea to continue to talk and achieve results,” CCTV quoted him as saying. His visit to North Korea was the first by a Chinese president in 14 years. Mr. Xi is expected to meet with President Donald Trump next week in Japan and could pass him a message from Mr. Kim about the nuclear negotiations. Following Thursday’s banquet, the leaders and their wives attended a mass performance of music, dance and calisthenics at a packed 110,000-seat stadium. The spectacle featured gymnasts, dancers and flip-card-holding spectators performing in precise unison – at one point producing a huge image of a waving Chinese flag in the stands, then flipping their cards to show the North-Korean flag. Mr. Xi and Mr. Kim waved to cheering crowds during the performance, dubbed “Invincible Socialism,” according to KCNA. Performing groups sang Chinese favourites and put on what KCNA termed “the peculiar display of Chinese folk dances.” The show ended with red fireworks over the May Day Stadium. Nuclear talks between the United States and North Korea broke down after the failed summit between Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump in February in Vietnam. The U.S. is demanding that North Korea abandon its nuclear weapons entirely before international sanctions are lifted. North Korea is seeking a step-by-step approach in which moves toward denuclearization are matched by concessions from the U.S., notably a relaxation of the sanctions. “Over more than a year, the North Korean side has taken many positive measures to avoid escalation of the situation and manage and control the peninsular situation, but it hasn’t received an active response from the relevant party,” Mr. Kim told Mr. Xi on Thursday, according to CCTV. Mr. Xi was expected to endorse North Korea’s calls for an incremental disarmament process. China is also pushing for a resumption of six-nation disarmament talks it had hosted but which had broken down a decade ago.

"385"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-jussie-smollett-case-to-be-reviewed-by-special-prosecutor-3/"|"Robert Chiarito Julia Jacobs"|"A judge Friday ordered that a special prosecutor be appointed to independently investigate charges that actor Jussie Smollett staged a racist hate crime against himself, as well as the prosecutors’ abrupt decision in March to drop the felony counts against him. The judge’s order concerned the decision by Kim Foxx, the Cook County state’s attorney, to separate herself from the investigation and appoint her deputy, Joseph Magats, as “acting state’s attorney” to oversee the case. In a critical ruling, Judge Michael P. Toomin of the Circuit Court of Cook County wrote that the decision raised “problematic concerns” because the proper procedure should have involved Foxx asking the court to appoint a special prosecutor. Instead, Toomin wrote, Foxx’s breach of protocol resulted in a “fictitious office” with no “legal existence” having control over the Smollett case. Foxx said Friday she disagreed with the judge’s conclusion that a special prosecutor was required. She said she had followed the advice of her chief ethics officer, April Perry, when deciding to recuse herself. That prompted a rebuke from Perry, who left the office soon after the charges were dropped. Perry said that in February, she had advised that Magats ask a court to appoint a special prosecutor but that Magats responded that Foxx had decided against it. Smollett, who turned 37 Friday, had been accused of paying two acquaintances to stage an attack against himself in which they shouted racist and homophobic slurs and placed a noose around his neck. In February, Foxx removed herself from the case, saying publicly that it was because she had earlier contact with representatives of Smollett. Foxx appointed Magats to oversee the case. On March 26, the office suddenly dropped all 16 felony counts against Smollett, saying he had agreed to forfeit the $10,000 bond paid for his release and that he was not a threat to public safety. The decision does not mean that Smollett will face charges again, but Toomin gave the special prosecutor the power to reopen the case “if reasonable grounds exist” and to bring charges against anyone else believed to have committed a crime in the course of the case. The judge did not name the special prosecutor in his ruling. One option would be to appoint a state’s attorney from a different county.

"386"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-former-cypriot-president-dimitris-christofias-dies-at-72/"|"Menelaos Hadjicostis"|"Dimitris Christofias, Cyprus’ first communist president whose troubled tenure was marked by near financial ruin that necessitated an international rescue, uproar over a deadly Iranian munitions blast and failure to end the country’s ethnic division, died Friday. He was 72. Cyprus President Nicos Anastasiades confirmed his predecessor’s death in a written message, expressing “deep sorrow.” Anastasiades said he and Christofias may have been on divergent political paths, but he did what he thought was best for his country. Conveying his condolences to the Christofias’ family, Anastasiades said his predecessor had been in frail health for many years. Christofias, who was president from 2008-2013, had been in a critical condition since being admitted to Nicosia General hospital in May. Israeli doctors had assisted Cypriot colleagues in treating the former president. Christofias’ personal doctor Michael Minas told state-run Cyprus News Agency the former president died at 5:36 p.m. local time (1436 GMT; 10:36 a.m. EDT). Condolences to Christofias’ family poured in from Greek Cypriot political leaders as well as the leader of the breakaway Turkish Cypriots Mustafa Akinci, who did so in a tweet. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras praised Christofias as a “genuine leader” of the Cypriot people and a “great fighter of the Left” who was always on the front line of the struggle for social justice and for reunifying Cyprus. Anastasiades will chair a Cabinet meeting Saturday to work out the details of Christofias’ funeral arrangements. Christofias was the only Cypriot president not to seek re-election, citing his failure to achieve his “life’s vision” of reunifying the country that had been split since Turkey invaded in 1974 following a coup by supporters of union with Greece. After his March 2008 rise to power, Christofias was hailed as the leader with the best chance to achieve a peace breakthrough that had eluded his predecessors, thanks to long-standing ties with the Turkish Cypriot left-wing trade union movement. But all the optimism faded as talks with two Turkish Cypriot leaders dragged on over five years without tangible results. Some faulted Christofias for allowing momentum to drain from the process. “I will leave truly miserable, because what I had promised can’t happen given Turkey’s intransigence, so from here on in, I’ll suffer along with you as a common citizen,” he had told municipal officials shortly before leaving office in 2013. Christofias’ “man-of-the-people” persona, which he often played up to underscore his working-class roots, endeared him to many. His election offered a curious paradox of Cypriot politics – an avowed communist in charge of a country with a free-market economy that boasted membership in the European Union, which Christofias’ party had once denounced as being in league with the “imperialist” NATO alliance. But as his presidency wore on and the economy began to tank, many came to view him as ill-equipped to govern, especially in matters of the economy. The turning point in Christofias’ presidency came on July 11, 2011, when a 400-ton stash of seized Iranian munitions spontaneously combusted at a naval base where it had been stored, exposed to the elements, for nearly two years. The blast killed 13 people, wrecked the island’s main power station and sparked weeks of protests calling for Christofias’ resignation over his administration’s perceived ineptitude. An ensuing inquiry into the blast found Christofias personally responsible for the disaster, something that he vehemently rejected, insisting that subordinates misled him and that a separate police report vindicated him. “I’m easy with my conscience,” he said in a 2012 interview, insisting that he was the target of a “war of extermination” by his political opponents. The disaster exacerbated an acute banking crisis that had locked Christofias into an acrimonious feud with former Central Bank Governor Athanasios Orphanides over who was to blame for it. Another inquiry held Christofias primarily responsible for bringing the country to near-bankruptcy because he pursued “reckless” economic policies, ignored warnings over spending and worsened problems by delaying talks on an international bailout. Christofias argued the inquiry was “illegal” and the report “fraught with untruths and slander” that offered cover to the banks, who he claimed were the real culprits. Opinion polls showed Christofias to have scored some of the lowest approval ratings of any Cypriot president. The son of a builder and one of five children, Soviet-educated Christofias’ decades-long involvement with Cyprus’ communist Progressive Party for the Working People (AKEL) culminated in 1988 when he became the party’s youngest-ever secretary-general at the age of 41. Christofias underwent a life-saving kidney transplant in 1999, in which the donor was his sister. He also had open-heart surgery earlier in that same year. He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth, two daughters and a son, and grandchildren.

Irwan Syahri, from the local disaster-mitigation agency in Langkat district, said the dead included three children. He said many of the victims were burned beyond recognition. TV footage showed the burned-out structure, its floor littered with twisted metal, blackened corrugated iron roofing and other debris. Faisal Riza, whose wife Marlina died in the fire, said the workers at the match business were all women, some of whom had their children with them. “I was walking to a mosque for prayers when I heard the factory in an alley just about 200 metres from my house was on fire,” he said at a police hospital in the provincial capital Medan where bodies were taken. “I ran to save her, but it was too late. When I got there, the factory was burned down.” The house owner, an elderly woman identified only as Ros, told MetroTV that she had rented the property for the past four years to a businessman from the provincial capital, Medan. Another man, Sofyan, said his wife and 10-year-old daughter died in the fire and were prevented from escaping by a locked front door that was also blocked by equipment. The fire started at the rear of the property, he and Mr. Riza said. “Only a DNA test can confirm the bodies,” said Sofyan, who uses a single name. “I want to bring them home soon regardless of their condition. I want to bury them immediately.” Millions of Indonesians work in unsafe conditions in informal or poorly regulated industries, and accidents and fatalities are common. Dozens died in the collapse of an unlicensed gold mine in North Sulawesi in February, and at least 47 people including underage workers were killed by a blaze at a fireworks factory in a Jakarta satellite city in October, 2017. North Sumatra police spokesman M.P. Nainggolan said the cause of the match-factory fire was still unclear.

"388"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-major-airlines-reroute-flights-around-the-strait-of-hormuz-after-iran/"|"Michael D. Shear Helene Cooper Eric Schmitt"|"President Donald Trump said Friday morning that the U.S. military had been “cocked and loaded” for a strike against Iran on Thursday night but that he called it off with 10 minutes to spare when a general told him that 150 people would probably die in the attack. In a series of tweets Friday morning, Trump said that he was prepared to retaliate against three sites in Iran for that country’s downing of a U.S. surveillance drone but that he pulled back because the death of that many Iranians would not be “proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone.” Trump said in an NBC interview later Friday that news reports that he had called off the mission while it was underway were inaccurate. But two senior U.S. officials said again Friday that the military had received the president’s go-ahead and that jets were headed toward targets in Iran when the mission was aborted. Thursday’s episode was another chaotic moment on the world stage for a president whose credibility with allies is already strained from 2 1/2 years of delivering bellicose threats, sometimes without following through. But a person familiar with Trump’s thinking said that the president, for one, was pleased with Thursday night’s events because he liked the “command” of approving the strike but also the decisiveness of calling it off. “I thought about it for a second, and I said, ‘You know what? They shot down an unmanned drone, plane, whatever you want to call it,’” Trump told NBC’s Chuck Todd in an interview that took place Friday and is to be broadcast Sunday. “And here we are, sitting with 150 dead people that would have taken place probably within a half an hour after I said go ahead. And I didn’t like it.” The president’s description of his decision-making process, unorthodox for previous presidents, was part of a day of shifting stories and contradictory statements that made it difficult to resolve outstanding questions about how the confrontation unfolded. Jack Keane, a former Army vice chief of staff who frequently talks to Trump, said Friday that he was told the Iranians privately expressed frustration to the United States about an Iranian tactical commander who went too far in firing the missile that took down the U.S. drone. “They’re frustrated and furious with what happened,” Keane said. But that was contradicted in public statements Friday from Iranian officials, who insisted they purposely took the drone down to send Americans a message. On Friday, another conflicting narrative continued: the dispute over the location of the drone when it was shot down. Iranian government officials released photographs Friday morning of what they said were fragments of the high-altitude surveillance drone retrieved from Iranian territorial waters. Iran continued to insist it shot the drone down after it violated the country’s airspace. To bolster its claims, Iran released video late Thursday of what it said was the moment the drone was shot down. A top Iranian commander also claimed on Twitter on Friday that a second U.S. aircraft — a surveillance plane capable of carrying 35 passengers and crew members — had violated Iranian airspace. But he said the Iranian military chose not to shoot it down. “We did not do this. Because our goal was to warn Americans,” wrote Amir Ali Hajizadeh, a commander with Iran’s Revolutionary Guard. U.S. officials countered Iran’s claims with images of the drone’s flight path that they insisted showed it had never entered Iranian airspace. The images offered little context and initially included an incorrect description of the drone’s flight path. On Friday night, the Pentagon confirmed the presence of a second surveillance aircraft, a Navy P-8A Poseidon, which officials said took photographs of the drone being shot down. But a senior Trump administration official said there was concern inside the U.S. government about whether the drone, or another U.S. surveillance aircraft, or even the P-8A manned aircraft flown by a military aircrew, actually did violate Iranian airspace at some point. The official said the doubt was one of the reasons Trump called off the strike. In his tweets Friday morning, Trump called Iran a “much weakened nation” because he decided to withdraw from the nuclear agreement negotiated by his predecessor and because of the sanctions that his administration had imposed. He also suggested that new sanctions had been imposed on Iran on Thursday night, but he did not elaborate. “Sanctions are biting & more added last night,” he tweeted. “Iran can NEVER have Nuclear Weapons, not against the USA, and not against the WORLD!” Critical reaction to the president’s decision came swiftly Friday, suggesting that the aborted strike could exacerbate divisions on national security within the Republican Party, between those agitating for more aggressive action and others deeply opposed. “The failure to respond to this kind of direct provocation that we’ve seen now from the Iranians, in particular over the last several weeks, could in fact be a very serious mistake,” Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, chairwoman of the Republican Conference, told Hugh Hewitt, a conservative radio host, in an interview. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, blasted Trump, tweeting: “There is no justification for further escalating this crisis—we need to step back from the brink of war.” Top Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, said they were not informed of the planned strikes, a departure from normal practice. “I did not receive any heads-up that there was a strike that was in the works,” Pelosi told reporters. European allies were noticeably quiet Friday beyond asking both Washington and Tehran not to further drive up tensions. Middle East experts said the flare-up underscored the contradictions in Trump’s “maximum pressure” policy on Tehran, which has squeezed the Iranian economy with sanctions on its crucial oil exports while demanding concessions from Iran. Trump, the experts said, has given hard-liners in Iran reason to support retaliation against the United States. They cited the recent attacks on oil tankers in waters near Iran. “Iran’s actions in the gulf, while outrageous and unacceptable, show that it has cards to play, too, and force the administration to confront the trade-offs and contradictions it has been able to avoid,” said Derek Chollet, an executive vice president for security and defense policy at the German Marshall Fund and a former senior defense official in the Obama administration. This is not the first time that the United States and Iran have offered conflicting accounts of U.S. military actions near Iran. On July 3, 1988, the Vincennes, a Navy guided missile cruiser, shot down an Iranian passenger jet, killing 290 people. The Defense Department initially denied that the Vincennes had shot it down. Then the Pentagon said that the jet was descending toward the ship in a threatening manner. The Defense Department also said it radioed the plane repeatedly in warning. The first two assertions turned out to be false and the last assertion irrelevant because the Navy was using a frequency rarely checked by passenger jets. In 1996, the United States, expressing “deep regret,” agreed to pay $61.8 million to the victims’ families.

"389"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-skydiving-plane-crashes-in-hawaii-killing-all-11-aboard/"|"Audrey McAvoy And Andrew Selsky"|"A skydiving plane crashed and burst into flames just after takeoff from a small seaside airfield on the island of Oahu, killing 11 people, officials said Saturday. Authorities initially reported that nine people died in the crash Friday evening and that three of them were customers of a skydiving company and six were employees. But the Hawaii Department of Transportation tweeted Saturday that officials later “confirmed there were 11 people on board the plane” and no survivors. The twin-engine Beechcraft King Air plane took off from Dillingham Airfield on the north shore of the island. The plane turned around after it took off and appeared to be heading back to the airfield when it skimmed over some trees and crashed near the airfield’s perimeter fence, witness Steven Tickemeyer told KHON television news. “We showed up a couple minutes after, and the whole plane was engulfed in flames,” he said. The plane was operated by the Oahu Parachute Center skydiving company and the ratio of employees to customers aboard suggested that tandem jumps may have been planned in which the customers would have jumped while attached to experienced skydivers, Tim Sakahara, a spokesman for the Hawaii Department of Transportation, told reporters. The site of the crash was “quite a ways away from the runway” and some family members of those aboard were at the airport when the plane went down at about 6:30 p.m., said Honolulu Police Chief Manuel Neves. “In my 40 years as a firefighter here in Hawaii, this is the most tragic aircraft incident that we’ve had,” Neves said. The plane was engulfed in flames when firefighters made it to the crash site about an hour drive from Honolulu, Neves said. The victims were not identified. Two Federal Aviation Administration inspectors went to the crash site Friday and investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board that will investigate the crash were expected to arrive Saturday evening, said safety board spokesman Eric Weiss. The plane with two turboprop engines was manufactured in 1967, FAA records said. The phone for Oahu Parachute Center went unanswered Saturday. On its website, the company says the jumps that it offers on Hawaii are “a magical experience. There really is no better place in the world to skydive.” Its tandem jumps are listed for prices ranging from $170 to $250. Videos from the company’s Facebook page show jumps from the same Beechcraft King Air that crashed, with customers strapped to employees and dropping from a side door of the aircraft from 10,000 feet (3,000 metres) or higher, with the Pacific Ocean and the Oahu’s green mountains far below. Dillingham Airfield is used mostly for skydiving and glider flights. Hawaii shares the airfield with the Army, which uses it for helicopter night-vision training.

"390"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-trump-says-hell-delay-deportation-operation-aimed-at-undocumented-2/"|"Michael D. Shear"|"President Donald Trump on Saturday delayed plans for nationwide raids to deport families in the country illegally, but he threatened to unleash Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in two weeks if Democrats do not submit to changes in asylum law that they have long opposed. The announcement, made on Twitter as Trump was meeting with aides at Camp David, was the president’s latest attempt to pressure his adversaries into making immigration changes. In May, he threatened to levy tariffs on Mexico unless it did more to stop the flow of migrants into the United States. Immigration agents had been planning to sweep into several immigrant communities in 10 major cities – including Miami, Los Angeles, Houston and Chicago – beginning Sunday. Officials said Friday that they had targeted about 2,000 families in a show of force intended to demonstrate their strict enforcement of immigration laws. Children of immigrants – some of whom were born in the United States – had faced the prospect of being forcibly separated from their parents. Mark Morgan, acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, had announced this month that his agency would begin the raids at some point in the future. But Monday, Trump revealed on Twitter that they would start the following week, claiming officials would deport millions of people and sending panic through cities across the country. The president’s abrupt reversal Saturday came as lawmakers were considering a measure to send $4.5-billion in humanitarian aid to the border, money the Trump administration has said is desperately needed to handle a huge influx of migrants. Some Democrats, including members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, had threatened to withhold their support for the funding package when it comes to a vote in the House this upcoming week, in protest of Trump’s immigration policies. The specter of high-profile immigration raids had risked imperiling its chances of passage. The Senate has reached a bipartisan deal on a similar measure, though Democrats have conditioned their support on assurances that none of the money would go toward Trump’s threatened raids. Democratic lawmakers and immigration activists had demanded in recent days that the raids be stopped, calling them a cruel attack on minority communities whose only crime was illegally entering the country. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called Trump on Friday evening to persuade him to cancel the raids, according to a person familiar with the conversation who was not authorized to speak about it. During the 12-minute call, the president said he would consider doing so but made no commitments, the person said. On Saturday, Pelosi put out a strongly worded statement, calling the raids “heartless” and saying they would rip families apart and terrorize communities. She publicly urged Trump to “stop this brutal action.” The president did that a few hours later, announcing that “at the request of Democrats, I have delayed the Illegal Immigration Removal Process (Deportation) for two weeks.” But Trump made clear he planned to use the threat of family deportations to extract concessions from Democratic lawmakers. He said he had delayed the raids “to see if the Democrats and Republicans can get together and work out a solution to the Asylum and Loophole problems at the Southern Border.” “If not, Deportations start!” he tweeted. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has said he wants to work with Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., on a possible solution to asylum and other immigration issues. Graham introduced a bill that would radically revamp immigration policy, blocking many migrants from seeking asylum and loosening rules around detention. But the odds that a negotiation between the two senators will bear fruit are exceedingly slim. Shortly after Trump’s tweet, Pelosi responded on Twitter, saying: “Mr. President, delay is welcome. Time is needed for comprehensive immigration reform. Families belong together. The president was not specific in his tweet about what changes he was demanding, but Trump has angrily denounced the country’s asylum laws as “stupid” and the “worst in the world.” He has claimed that releasing migrants and their families into the United States while they wait for their asylum cases to proceed amounts to the “catch and release” of dangerous criminals. The coordinated deportation operation, scheduled to begin in the predawn hours of Sunday, would have targeted immigrants who crossed the border in recent years and either received deportation orders from a judge or failed to appear for a court appearance. They were among thousands of migrants who had their immigration cases expedited by the Trump administration in fall. Deportation raids are not uncommon. But the scale of the raids that were expected to begin Sunday was much greater, spanning several states over multiple days. The raids also drew condemnation because ICE agents planned to specifically target adults with children, raising again the possibility that families would be separated. The Trump administration abandoned its policy of separating migrant families at the border after it sparked global outrage. On Friday night, the Guatemalan-Maya Center in Lake Worth, Florida, held an information session about immigration. Lake Worth, part of Palm Beach County, has for decades attracted Guatemalans who work in construction and agriculture as well as at resorts nearby. By Saturday, some immigrants without legal status had already gone underground to avoid arrest, having left their homes to stay with relatives or friends in other places. Others said they had prepared to hunker down and hope for the best. “My family was shopping for the whole week today. We didn’t plan to go out all week,” said Jessi Zavala, 23, the American child of an Nicaraguan mother, who was working the cash register at World Thrift Store. Candi Vasquez, 13, who was born in Florida to parents in the country illegally, said that she and her brother, Rudolfo, 8, were still frightened after hearing about the postponement. “I am kind of happy,” Candi said. “But if it happens in two weeks, I am still scared. I don’t want to lose my mom.” The surge of Central American families crossing the border has infuriated Trump. In May, more than 144,200 migrants were taken into custody at the border, the highest monthly total in 13 years. Border patrol facilities, built to house adults who would quickly be deported, are now packed with migrants, including children, who would usually be housed in shelters managed by the Health and Human Services Department. Those shelters have also been pushed beyond capacity. Morgan, who won his job at ICE in part by pushing for aggressive deportations in appearances on Fox News, has said the new family raids were needed as a deterrent. But officials within the Department of Homeland Security in recent days have fiercely debated whether to begin the operation, according to government authorities. Officials within the agency have been hesitant about the effort because of limited space in family detention facilities and the bad optics of separating parents from their children. Trump’s tweet of the operation frustrated high-ranking ICE officials, including Deputy Director Matthew Albence, who expressed concern that the disclosure put agents’ safety at risk, a government official said. One Homeland Security official said the operation could lead to “collateral deportations,” in which agents looking for certain individuals detain others who happened to be present nearby. In a meeting with White House officials Friday, acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan pushed back against the planned raids, arguing that they would lead to family separations. He said he could achieve similar numbers over a measured deportation plan spanning four weeks. Mayors of several cities, including Denver, Baltimore and San Francisco, vowed not to cooperate with immigration authorities. On Saturday morning, Thomas Homan, former acting director of ICE, went on Fox News to advocate the operations and criticize officials who were arguing against Sunday’s raid, including McAleenan. “These mayors aren’t the only ones resisting ICE,” said Homan, whom Trump has chosen as border czar. (Homan has not yet accepted the position.) “You’ve got the acting secretary of Homeland Security resisting what ICE is trying to do.” News of the delay spread quickly in immigrant communities on Saturday, as acute dread turned to confusion. In Lake Worth, the Rev. Frank O’Loughlin, who runs the Guatemalan-Maya Center, had tried to soothe anxieties that morning. “A lot of people are scared today,” O’Loughlin said at the information session. “Let everything else go. You and your children are here.” Hours later, the priest heard that the raids had been postponed. “Wow. We are at the end of a yo-yo string,” he said. “It’s incomprehensible.” "|"Trump delays deportation operation aimed at undocumented families "|"2019-06-22T16:19:21-0400"|"TRUMP,IMMIG,RAIDS,NYT,ICE,immigration,undocumented families,trump,border,asylum,president,ice,country,week,family",

On Thursday, an Iranian missile destroyed a U.S. Global Hawk surveillance drone, an incident that Washington said happened in international airspace. Trump later said he had called off a military strike to retaliate because it could have killed 150 people. Tehran repeated on Saturday that the drone was shot down over its territory and said it would respond firmly to any U.S. threat. Speaking in Washington on Saturday before heading to the U.S. presidential retreat at Camp David, Trump indicated the government was taking a diplomatic path to put pressure on Tehran by moving to impose new sanctions. Military action was “always on the table,” the president said, but he added that he was open to quickly reaching a deal with Iran that he said would bolster the country’s flagging economy. “We will call it ‘Let’s make Iran great again,’” Trump said. He later wrote on Twitter from Camp David: “We are putting major additional Sanctions on Iran on Monday. I look forward to the day that Sanctions come off Iran, and they become a productive and prosperous nation again.” The Trump administration has sought to use promises of economic revival to solve other thorny foreign policy challenges, including the Israel-Palestinian peace process, with the White House outlining on Saturday a plan to create a global investment fund to lift the Palestinian and neighboring Arab state economies. Both Trump and Tehran have said they are not seeking a war, but Iran has warned of a “crushing” response if attacked. “Regardless of any decision they (U.S. officials) make... we will not allow any of Iran’s borders to be violated. Iran will firmly confront any aggression or threat by America,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi told the semi-official Tasnim news agency on Saturday. A senior commander of the elite Revolutionary Guards struck a similarly defiant note, in comments quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA). “If the violation is repeated then our response will be repeated,” said Brigadier General Amirali Hajizadeh, head of the Guards’ aerospace division. “It’s possible that this infringement of the Americans was carried out by a general or some operators.” Iran’s Foreign Ministry summoned a United Arab Emirates envoy on Saturday because the UAE allowed the drone to be launched from a U.S. military base on its territory, the Fars news agency reported. The Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, published a map on Twitter with detailed coordinates which he said showed the drone was flying over the Islamic Republic’s territorial waters. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement on Saturday that the United States had “shown beyond any doubt” that the drone was in international airspace. “When the Iranian regime decides to forgo violence and meet our diplomacy with diplomacy, it knows how to reach us,” he said. “Until then, our diplomatic isolation and economic pressure campaign against the regime will intensify.” He also denied reports U.S. forces would evacuate personnel from a military base in neighboring Iraq over what military sources had said were “potential security threats.” FLIGHTS REROUTED Tensions in the region began to worsen significantly when Trump pulled out of a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six powers and reimposed sanctions on the country. The sanctions had been lifted under the pact in return for Tehran curbing its nuclear program. The United States and Iran’s main regional rival Saudi Arabia have also blamed Iran for attacks on two oil tankers last week in the Gulf of Oman and on four tankers off the United Arab Emirates on May 12. Both incidents happened near the strategic Strait of Hormuz, a major conduit for global oil supplies. Iran has denied any involvement. On Thursday, the Pentagon launched a long-planned cyber attack in retaliation for the oil tanker incidents, Yahoo News reported, citing former intelligence officials. The cyber strike disabled Iranian rocket launch systems, the Washington Post said on Saturday. A Department of Defense spokeswoman said it would not comment on cyberspace operations, intelligence or planning. Washington, meanwhile, accused Tehran of stepping up cyber attacks. Chris Krebs, director of the Department of Homeland Security’s cybersecurity agency, said on Twitter that officials have detected a rise in “malicious cyber activity” directed at the United States by people tied to the Iranian government. World powers have called for calm and sent in envoys for talks to try to lower the temperature of a dispute that has pushed up the price of oil. German Chancellor Angela Merkel called on Saturday for a political resolution of the crisis, adding: “That is what we are working on.” Britain’s Foreign Office said Middle East minister Andrew Murrison would visit Tehran on Sunday to raise concerns about “Iran’s regional conduct and its threat to cease complying with the nuclear deal.” Iran has threatened to breach the deal if the European signatories to the agreement fail to salvage it by shielding Tehran from U.S. sanctions. “The Europeans will not be given more time beyond July 8 to save the deal,” Mousavi said, referring to Iran’s deadline of 60 days that Tehran announced in May. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday prohibited U.S. operators from flying in Tehran-controlled airspace over the Strait of Hormuz and Gulf of Oman. Saudi Arabian Airlines joined some other international airlines on Saturday in taking related precautions. Iran said on Saturday that its airspace was “safe and secure” for all planes to cross, Tasnim reported. Separately, Iran has executed a former contract employee for the aerospace organization of the Ministry of Defence on charges of spying for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, the IRIB news agency reported on Saturday.

Regional tensions have flared in recent days. The U.S. abruptly called off military strikes against Iran in response to the shooting down of an unmanned American surveillance drone on Thursday. The Trump administration has combined a “maximum pressure” campaign of economic sanctions with a buildup of American forces in the region following the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers. A new set of U.S. sanctions on Iran are expected to be announced Monday. The Sunday attack by the Yemeni rebels, known as Houthis, targeted the Saudi airport in Abha. Saudi Arabia has been at war with the Houthis in Yemen for more than four years. A Houthi spokesman, Yahia al-Sarie, said earlier Sunday the rebels had launched drones targeting Saudi airports in the southern cities of Abha and Jizan. Saudi Arabia’s military spokesman Col. Turki al-Maliki did not say what type of weapon was used in Sunday’s attack, which took place shortly after 9 p.m. local time. The Saudi Press Agency reported that a Syrian resident of Saudi Arabia had been killed, but did not identify the nationalities of those wounded. It was the second attack in less than two weeks on Abha’s airport. The Houthis launched a cruise missile at the airport on June 12, wounding 26 passengers inside. The Iranian-backed Houthis also claimed responsibility for bomb-laden drone strikes that targeted a key Saudi oil pipeline in recent weeks. Also Sunday, U.S Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was travelling to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates for talks on Iran. His meetings in Saudi Arabia will be in the Red Sea city of Jiddah, about 315 miles (505 kilometres) north of where the Saudi airport was struck. Speaking to reporters before flying out, he said he’ll be talking to the two U.S. allies “about how to make sure that we are all strategically aligned” and how to build a global coalition to “push back against the world’s largest state sponsor of terror.” At the same time, Pompeo reiterated that the U.S. was prepared to negotiate with Iran to ease tensions. “We’re prepared to negotiate with no preconditions. They know precisely how to find us,” he said. Meanwhile, U.S. national security adviser John Bolton was in Jerusalem on Sunday, where he said Iran should not “mistake U.S. prudence and discretion for weakness.” President Donald Trump has said he backed away from planned strikes after learning 150 people would be killed. Bolton’s tough message seemed to be aimed not only at Tehran, but also at reassuring key U.S. allies that the White House remains committed to maintaining pressure on Iran. Israel, along with Arab countries in the Gulf, considers Iran to be their greatest threat, and Trump’s last-minute about face appears to have raised questions about U.S. willingness to use force against the Islamic Republic. On Sunday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani blamed the United States’ “interventionist military presence” for fanning the flames. He was quoted by the official IRNA news agency. Bolton, a long-time Iran hawk, emphasized that the U.S. reserved the right to attack at a later point. “No one has granted them a hunting license in the Middle East. As President Trump said on Friday our military is rebuilt, new and ready to go,” Bolton said alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, himself a vocal critic of Iran over the years. Netanyahu, a long-time opponent of the nuclear deal, has remained uncharacteristically quiet throughout the current crisis between the U.S. and Iran. The Israeli leader appears to be wary of being seen as pushing the U.S. into a new Middle Eastern military conflict. Standing alongside Bolton, Netanyahu said Iranian involvement in conflicts across the region had increased as a result of the nuclear deal, which lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for set limits on its uranium enrichment levels. Netanyahu made no mention of the called-off air strike and said he was “pleased” by U.S. plans for increased economic pressure. But some Israeli commentators said that Trump’s about-face was a cause for concern. Iran’s foreign minister said Bolton was trying to force the U.S. into a conflict with Iran. Javad Zarif tweeted that the presidential adviser was “moments away from trapping” Trump into a “war,” before the U.S. president called off the strikes against Iran. America’s European allies have expressed deep concern about the volatile standoff. A top British diplomat was in Tehran on Sunday to discuss preventing any “escalation and miscalculation,” according to the U.K. Foreign Office. The two-day visit of Andrew Murrison, the UK’s minister of state for the Middle East, was aimed at “open, frank and constructive engagement” with his Iranian counterparts, according to the Foreign Office. This included reiterating the UK’s assessment that Iran almost certainly bears responsibility for recent attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman, which Iran denies. Murrison added that Iran must continue to meet its commitments under the nuclear deal. Iran has threatened to break the limits set on its uranium stockpile by the deal in the coming days, if European powers don’t find a way to circumvent U.S. sanctions. According to IRNA, Iranian officials told Murrision they hoped that European signatories to the nuclear deal will pursue “normal relations and trade” despite the sanctions. Also Sunday, a top Iranian military commander warned that any conflict with Iran would have uncontrollable consequences across the region and endanger the lives of U.S. forces. Maj. Gen. Gholamali Rashid’s remarks, published by the semi-official Fars news agency, were made while addressing Iran’s powerful Revolutionary Guards Corps during a field visit to a command centre for Iranian radars and missile systems. Throughout the recent crisis, Trump has wavered between bellicose language and actions toward Iran and a more accommodating tone. His administration is aiming to cripple Iran’s economy and force policy changes by reimposing sanctions, including on Iranian oil exports. He’s also dangled the prospect of eventually becoming an unlikely “best friend” of America’s long-time Middle Eastern adversary. The regional tensions have prompted major international carriers, including Saudi Arabia’s state airline Saudia, to divert flight routes away from the Gulf of Oman and Strait of Hormuz. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration on Friday barred U.S.-registered aircraft from operating over parts of the Persian Gulf.

The governing party’s candidate, former Turkish prime minister Binali Yildirim, conceded moments after returns showed him trailing well behind Mr. Imamoglu, 54 per cent to 45 per cent. Mr. Imamoglu increased his lead from a March mayoral election by hundreds of thousands of votes. Mr. Erdogan congratulated Mr. Imamoglu in a tweet. Analysts noted the President, who is grappling with an economic downturn and several international crises, could limit the mayor’s power or undermine Mr. Imamoglu’s authority in other ways. Mr. Imamoglu narrowly won an earlier mayoral election on March 31, but Mr. Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party, AKP, challenged the vote over alleged irregularities. He spent 18 days in office before Turkey’s electoral board annulled the results after weeks of partial recounts. The voided vote raised concerns domestically and abroad about the state of Turkish democracy and whether Mr. Erdogan’s party would accept any electoral loss. AKP has governed Turkey since 2002. “You have protected the reputation of democracy in Turkey with the whole world watching,” Mr. Imamoglu, his voice hoarse after weeks of campaigning, told supporters. Jubilant supporters chanted “Mayor again! Mayor again!” Others hung out of cars, blaring horns and waving red-and-white Turkish flags. Mr. Erdogan campaigned hard for Mr. Yildirim in Istanbul, where the President started his political career as mayor in 1994. Lisel Hintz, an assistant international relations professor at Johns Hopkins University SAIS, said Mr. Imamoglu withstood a divisive campaign and prevailed with a positive message. The significance of his win “cannot be understated,” Ms. Hintz said. “We now have to wait and see whether Imamoglu’s tenure as mayor will be interfered with in any way, whether by cutting off funding and hampering his office’s ability to provide services or by removing him under some legal pretext,” Ms. Hintz said. AKP also lost control of the capital city of Ankara in Turkey’s March local elections, which were held as the country battled high inflation and two credit rating downgrades in the past year. Melahat Ugen said she switched her vote to the opposition because she could not afford to cover basic expenses. “I’ve certainly never voted left before,” she said. “But I’m 62, and a bag of onions costs too much. Everything is imported and we can’t afford it.” Istanbul, a city of more than 15 million, draws millions of tourists each year and is Turkey’s commercial and cultural hub. Straddling Europe and Asia, Istanbul accounted for 31 per cent of Turkey’s GDP in 2017. Mr. Erdogan has previously signalled an unwillingness to work with an opposition mayor, saying his party controls 25 of Istanbul’s 39 districts and a majority in the municipal assembly. Mr. Imamoglu will have to work with those officeholders to govern Istanbul, and he promised to do so Sunday. Addressing Mr. Erdogan in a speech, Mr. Imamoglu said, “I’m ready to work with you” to solve Istanbul’s problems. Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, Ankara office director of the German Marshall Fund, argued that the loss of Istanbul is likely to fuel speculation of divisions within the ruling party and among its supporters. “It’s now clear that a sizable portion of the AKP voters is seriously dissatisfied by policies of the AKP,” he said. “The [opposition] was a house that was united. The AKP house looked like one that was already divided.” He argued Mr. Erdogan is already facing “a perfect storm” this summer. Mr. Erdogan was already at odds with Western allies over Turkey’s plans to buy the Russian-made S-400 missile defence system and its challenge of EU-member Cyprus over natural-gas drilling rights.

"394"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-white-house-unveils-50-billion-palestinian-economic-plan-2/"|"Matthew Lee"|"The Trump administration on Saturday unveiled a US$50-billion Palestinian investment and infrastructure proposal intended to be the economic engine to power its much-anticipated, but still unreleased “deal of the century” Middle East peace plan. The scheme, which calls for a mix of public and private financing and intends to create at least one million new jobs for Palestinians, was posted to the White House website ahead of a two-day conference in Bahrain that is being held amid heavy skepticism about its viability and outright opposition from the Palestinians. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Saturday reiterated his rejection of the proposal and the conference. The “Peace to Prosperity” workshop on Tuesday and Wednesday will also take place amid heightened regional tensions over Iran that threaten to overshadow its goals. With no official participation from the two main protagonists, Israel and the Palestinians, and scant enthusiasm from others, continued uncertainty and strong doubts over the plan’s political vision and the distraction of potential U.S.-Iran conflict, expectations are decidedly low. U.S. President Donald Trump’s senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner faces high hurdles in building support for the initiative. The 10-year plan calls for projects worth US$27.5-billion in the West Bank and Gaza, and US$9.1-billion, US$7.4-billion and US$6.3-billion for Palestinians in Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon, respectively. Projects envisioned include those in the health care, education, power, water, high-technology, tourism and agriculture sectors. It calls for the creation of a “master fund” to administer the finances and implementation of the projects that is says are akin to the Marshall Plan that rebuilt Europe after the Second World War. The plan foresees more than doubling the Palestinian gross domestic product, reducing the Palestinian poverty rate by 50 per cent and cutting the sky-high Palestinian unemployment rate to nearly single digits, according to the documents, which do not specify exactly how the projects will be funded. It also calls for linking the West Bank and Gaza with a modern transportation network, including high-speed rail service. Such ideas have been floated in the past in previous peace proposals, but have run into Israeli security concerns. “Generations of Palestinians have lived under adversity and loss, but the next chapter can be defined by freedom and dignity,” the White House said, calling the plan “the most ambitious international effort for the Palestinian people to date.” But an already tough sell that has vexed U.S. administrations for decades is made tougher not least because Mr. Trump and his aides have refused to endorse a two-state solution to the conflict that has long been seen as the only viable path to lasting peace. They have also suggested they are open to unilateral Israeli annexation of occupied territory in the West Bank. And, officials say there is no intention of discussing either issue or the most contentious parts of their proposal to end the long-running conflict. Thus, the core political issues that are key to resolving the dispute, such as borders, the status of the holy city of Jerusalem, Israel’s security and the fate of Palestinian refugees, will not be raised. Such matters, U.S. officials have said, may have to wait until the fall, after Israeli elections, leaving numerous questions that potential investors almost certainly want answers to before making even tentative financial commitments. Palestinian leaders, angered by what they and their supporters see as blatant U.S. bias toward Israel, want nothing to do with the workshop and will not participate. The Palestinians have called for mass demonstrations against the conference on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. “The plan cannot pass because it ends the Palestinian cause,” Mr. Abbas said on Saturday. “We are not going to attend this workshop, the reason is that the economic situation should not be discussed before a political situation, so long as there is no political situation, we do not deal with any economic situation.” An economic adviser to Mr. Abbas said projects envisaged in the U.S. proposal could be considered, but only after the political question is agreed upon. “Yes, we need to build the infrastructure, the investment, the tourism sector ... but that cannot come before ending the Israeli occupation,” said Mohammed Mustafa, head of Palestinian Investment Fund. In Gaza, the rival Hamas militant group has also condemned the conference. “In one voice, we say no to the Manama workshop and the deal of the century,” Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said. He appealed to Bahrain’s king to “take a brave, strong, authentic Arab decision not to host this workshop” and called on Arab countries to cancel their planned participation. Complicating the Bahrain meeting is the fact that it coincides with a pledging conference in New York for the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, a 70-year-old institution that the Trump administration has defunded and wants to eliminate entirely. The UN Relief and Works Agency, or UNRWA, already provides health, education and other services to millions of Palestinians. Its supporters suspect the administration purposely scheduled the Bahrain conference to conflict with its event, adding that Mr. Kushner’s peace-plan partner Jason Greenblatt has publicly called for UNRWA’s dissolution. Mr. Greenblatt argued last month that the agency perpetuates Palestinian victimhood, abets anti-Israel sentiment and is an inefficient drain on funds that could be better directed. Mr. Kushner’s plan includes large sums of money for Jordan and Lebanon, countries with large Palestinian refugee populations, in an apparent attempt to have them absorbed into these countries. Regardless of American intent, the duelling meetings are likely to leave donors, particularly European countries, in an awkward position: torn between supporting an established international organization or a mystery concept being put together by a U.S. administration that has in two years reversed a half-century of American Middle East policy. Since Mr. Trump took office, he has recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, moving the U.S. embassy there from Tel Aviv, downgraded the consulate devoted to Palestinian issues, shut down the Palestinian office in Washington and slashed hundreds of millions of dollars in assistance to the West Bank and Gaza. Such steps have made Mr. Kushner’s prospects for success in Bahrain even slimmer, according to experts. “This is trying to dangle some benefits to the Palestinians to accept terms they already rejected,” said Shibley Telhami, a Mideast scholar and the Anwar Sadat professor for peace and development at the University of Maryland. “A lure to get the Palestinians to accept the unacceptable is not going to work. It’s impossible.” Although Washington’s Gulf Arab allies are supportive of the plan, Israel’s immediate neighbours have been more reluctant to embrace it. Jordan and Egypt, the only two Arab countries with peace deals with Israel, are sending mid-ranking officials from their finance ministries and not Cabinet ministers to Bahrain. Jordanian foreign ministry spokesman Sufian al-Qudah reiterated Amman’s position that a two-state solution, with a Palestinian state on the pre-1967 borders and a capital in east Jerusalem, “is the only way to resolve the conflict and achieve security, stability and comprehensive peace in the region.” Egypt supports the same conditions, the state-run news agency quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Ahmed Hafez as saying.

"395"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-mount-everests-growing-problems-with-abandoned-tents-and-human-waste/"|"Binaj Gurubacharya"|"After every party it’s time to clean up and Mount Everest is no different. The record number of climbers crowding the world’s highest mountain this season has left a government cleanup crew grappling with how to clear away everything from abandoned tents to human waste that threatens drinking water. Budget expedition companies charge as little as US$30,000 per climber, cutting costs including waste removal. Everest has so much garbage — depleted oxygen cylinders, food packaging, rope — that climbers use the trash as a kind of signpost. But this year’s haul from an estimated 700 climbers, guides and porters on the mountain has been a shock to the ethnic Sherpas who worked on the government’s cleanup drive this spring. Moreover, the tents are littering South Col, or Camp 4, which, at 8,000 metres (26,240 feet) is the highest campsite on Everest, just below the summit. The high winds at that elevation have scattered the tents and trash everywhere. “The altitude, oxygen levels, dangerously icy and slippery slopes, and bad weather of South Col make it very difficult to bring such big things as tents down,” said Dawa Steven Sherpa, who led an independent cleanup last month and has been a leading figure in the campaign to clean Mount Everest for the past 12 years. Exhausted climbers struggling to breathe and battling nausea leave heavy tents behind rather than attempt to carry them down. Sherpa said the logos on the ice-embedded tents that identify the expedition companies were deliberately ripped out so the culprits could evade detection. “It took us an hour to dig out just one tent out of the frozen ice and bring it down,” said Sherpa. His expeditions have alone brought down some 20,000 kilograms (44,000 pounds) of garbage since 2008. Sherpa estimated 30 tents had been left on South Col, and as much as 5,000 kilograms (11,000 pounds) of trash. Bringing it down is a herculean task when any misstep at such altitudes could be fatal. It is impossible to know exactly how much litter is spread across Everest because it only becomes visible when the snow melts. At Camp 2, two levels higher than Base Camp, the campaigners believe that around 8,000 kilograms (17,637 pounds) of human excrement were left during this year’s climbing season alone. Some climbers do not use makeshift toilets, instead digging a hole in the snow, letting the waste fall into small crevasses. However, rising temperatures have thinned the glacier, leaving fewer and smaller crevasses. The overflowing waste then spills downhill toward Base Camp and even communities below the mountain. People living at the Base Camp use melted snow for drinking water that climbers’ toilets threaten to contaminate. “During our expedition to Camp 2, eight of our 10 Sherpas got stomach illness from bad water at Camp 2,” said John All, a professor of environmental science at Western Washington University who visited Everest on a research expedition. For the Nepalese who regard the mountain as “Sagarmatha,” or Mother of the World, littering amounts to desecration. Climber Nima Doma, who returned recently from a successful ascent, gets angry thinking that the sacred mountain is being turned into a garbage dump. “Everest is our god and it was very sad to see our god so dirty. How can people just toss their trash on such a sacred place?” she said. The trash is creating danger for future climbers and spurring calls for action now. “When the snow melts the garbage surfaces. And when there is high wind, tents are blown and torn and the contents are scattered all over the mountain, which makes it even more dangerous for climbers already navigating a slippery, steep slope in snow and high winds,” said Ang Tshering, former president of Nepal Mountaineering Association. Ang Dorjee, who heads the independent Everest Pollution Control Committee, has demanded that the Nepal government — whose general oversight of Everest has come under scrutiny this year as climbers died waiting in line to ascend — institute some rules. “The problem is there are no regulations on how to dispose of the human waste. Some climbers use biodegradable bags that have enzymes which decompose human waste but most of them don’t,” he said. The bags are expensive and have to be imported from the United States. “The biggest problem and concern now on Everest is human waste. Hundreds of people are there for weeks who go to open toilets,” Tshering said. Melting conditions at Camp 2 create a odor that is sickening to climbers, and the waste will eventually contaminate water sources below and become a health hazard, he said. Tshering and other mountaineers say the government should mandate the use of biodegradable bags. It would spare Dorjee and his team the unpleasant task of collecting the waste and carrying it down the dangerous slopes. The government is working on a plan to scan and tag climbers’ equipment and gear. All climbers would have to deposit US$4,000 before their ascent and might not get the money back if they return without their items.

Millions of people demonstrated on the streets of Hong Kong this month against a bill that would allow people to be extradited to the mainland to face trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party. It triggered the most violent protests in decades when police fired rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse the crowds. The extradition bill and police reaction to the protests drew international criticism from rights groups. Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump will meet at the G20 summit in the Japanese city of Osaka this week amid heightened trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies. “What I can tell you for sure is that G20 will not discuss the Hong Kong issue. We will not allow G20 to discuss the Hong Kong issue,” Zhang said, when asked whether Trump and Xi would discuss Hong Kong at the G20. “Hong Kong is China’s special administrative region.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the eight children being repatriated were in the care of Australian government officials. He would not identify the children or say when they would reach Australia. Media reported that they include five children and grandchildren of Sydney-born convicted terrorist Khaled Sharrouf and three children of Islamic State group fighter Yasin Rizvic, from Melbourne. Both men and their wives died in the conflict zone. The children had been taken by an aid agency on Sunday to Iraq, The Australian newspaper reported. “The opportunity now is for these young children who are coming back to Australia, they can’t be held responsible for the crimes of their parents,” Morrison told reporters. The children would be provided with support services so that “they can fully integrate into a happy life in Australia,” Morrison said. “They’ve got off to a horrible start in life as a result of the appalling decisions of their parents and they’ll find their home in Australia and I’m sure they’ll be embraced by Australians and as a result of that embrace, I’m sure they’ll live positive and happy lives,” Morrison added. Sharrouf’s Sydney-based mother-in-law Karen Nettleton has launched several attempts to rescue the children from Syria and has led the campaign for Australian government intervention. Her lawyer Robert Van Aalst said he hoped Nettleton was with the children in Iraq, but had no direct communication with her due to security concerns. The eldest child, Zaynab, turned 18 last week and has been expecting her third child. Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported she’d yet to give birth. Zaynab would return to Australia with the newborn, her two children — Ayesha, 3, and Fatima, 2 — her 16-year-old sister Hoda, and her 8-year-old brother, Humzeh. “There will be medical examinations and various other support provided by the government which they have told us about to help the children acclimatize,” Van Aalst told ABC. “There are also some wounds that may need to be attended to. Young Hoda was wounded in the leg. Zaynab, I believe, had shrapnel wounds. It is not just physical wounds that have to be looked into but there is some other psychological issues, no doubt, that will have to be looked into,” he added. The Rizvic children are two boys and a girl aged between 6 and 12, The Australian reported. Clarke Jones, an Australian National University criminologist who specializes in radicalization, said the children would need treatment for trauma and could be radicalized. They could also be threatened by elements of the Australian community. “There are a lot of people who don’t want them back at all,” Jones said. “Because of that, they would also be under threat.” Mat Tinkler, director of the Save the Children Fund charity, said there were at least 50 Australian women and children in Syrian refugee camps and all should be repatriated. Khaled Sharrouf horrified the world in 2014 when he posted a photograph on social media of his young son clutching the severed head of a Syrian soldier. Then-U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry described that image as “one of the most disturbing, stomach-turning, grotesque photographs ever displayed.” Sharrouf’s wife, Tara Nettleton, brought their five children from Sydney to Syria in 2014. She died in a hospital a year later of a perforated intestine. Her husband and two eldest sons later died in an airstrike.

From a subway performer’s battered leather hat devoid of tips, to a bride-to-be’s empty purse, the lack of cash from the economic pressure facing Iran’s 80 million people can be seen everywhere. Many blame President Donald Trump and his maximalist policy on Iran, which has seen him pull out of Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers and levy punishing U.S. sanctions on the country. In recent weeks, Iran has threatened to break out of the deal unless European powers mitigate what it calls Trump’s “economic warfare.” Iran also appeared ready to push back against the buildup of U.S. forces in the region, after shooting down an American drone it says violated its airspace last week. In response, U.S. officials have vowed to pile on more sanctions. But alongside Trump, many Iranians blame their own government, which has careened from one economic disaster to another since its Islamic Revolution 40 years ago. “The economic war is a reality and people are under extreme pressure,” said Shiva Keshavarz, a 22-year-old accountant soon to be married. She said government leaders “keep telling us to be strong and endure the pressures, but we can already hear the sound of our bones breaking.” Walking by any money exchange shop is a dramatic reminder of the hardships most people are facing. At the time of the nuclear deal, Iran’s currency traded at 32,000 rials to $1. Today, the numbers listed in exchange shop windows have skyrocketed – it costs over 130,000 rials for one U.S. dollar. Inflation is over 37 per cent, according to government statistics. More than 3 million people, or 12 per cent of working-age citizens, are unemployed. That rate doubles for educated youth. Depreciation and inflation make everything more expensive – from fruits and vegetables to tires and oil, all the way to the big-ticket items, like mobile phones. A simple cellphone is about two months’ salary for the average government worker, while a single iPhone costs a 10 months’ salary. “When importing mobile phones into the country is blocked, dealers have to smuggle them in with black market dollar rates and sell them for expensive prices,” said Pouria Hassani, a mobile phone salesman in Tehran. “You can’t expect us to buy expensive and sell cheap to customers. We don’t want to make a loss either.” Hossein Rostami, a 33-year-old motorbike taxi driver and deliveryman, said the price of brake pads alone had jumped fivefold. “The cause of our problems is the officials’ incompetence,” he told The Associated Press as fellow motorbike drivers called out for passengers in Tehran. “Our country is full of wealth and riches.” The riches part is true – Iran is home to the world’s fourth-largest proven reserve of crude oil and holds the world’s second-largest proven reserve of natural gas, after Russia. But under Trump’s maximum-pressure campaign, the U.S. has cut off Iran’s ability to sell crude on the global market, and threatened to sanction any nation that purchases it. Oil covers a third of the $80-billion a year the government spends in Iran, meaning that a fall in oil revenues cuts into its social welfare programs, as well as its military expenditures. The rest of the country’s budget comes from taxes and non-oil exports, among them oil-based petrochemical products that provide up to 50 per cent of Iran’s $45-billion in non-oil export. In Tehran’s Laleh park, retired school teacher Zahra Ghasemi criticized the government for blaming “every problem” on U.S. sanctions. She says she has trouble paying for her basic livelihood. The price of a bottle of milk has doubled, along with that of vegetables and fruit. “We are dying under these pressures and a lack of solutions from officials,” Ghasemi said. Years of popular frustration with failed economic policies triggered protests in late 2017, which early the following year spiralled into anti-government demonstrations across dozens of cities and towns. The current problems take root in Iran’s faltering efforts to privatize its state-planned economy after the devastating war with Iraq in the 1980s, which saw 1 million people killed. But Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said earlier this month that the crunch on oil exports is hitting harder today than during the 1980s war, when Saddam Hussein’s forces targeted Iran’s oil trade. “Our situation is worse than during the war,” Zanganeh said. “We did not have such an export problem when Saddam was targeting our industrial units. Now, we cannot export oil labelled Iran.” Still, many Iranians pin the economic crisis on corruption as much as anything else. “Our problem is the embezzlers and thieves in the government,” said Nasrollah Pazouki, who has sold clothes in Tehran’s Grand Bazaar since before the 1979 Islamic Revolution. “When people come to power, instead of working sincerely and seriously for the people, we hear and read after a few months in newspapers that they have stolen billions and fled.” He added: “Whose money is that? It’s the people’s money.” Sanctions do cause some of the problems, said Jafar Mousavi, who runs a dry-goods store in Tehran. But many of the woes are self-inflicted from rampant graft, he said. “The economic war is not from outside of our borders but within the country,” Mousavi said. “If there was integrity among our government, producers and people, we could have overcome the pressures.” Yet people come and go each day to work on Tehran’s crowded metro, seemingly earning less each day for the same work. In one train car, Abbas Feayouji and his son Rahmat play mournful-sounding traditional love songs known as “Sultan-e Ghalbha,” or “King of Hearts” in Farsi. “People pay less than before,” said the elder Feayouji, a 47-year-old father of three, as he took a short break to speak to the AP. “I don’t know why they do, but it shows people have less money than before.” "|"Iranians under ‘extreme pressure’ as U.S. vows to pile on more sanctions"|"2019-06-24T02:18:58-0400"|"International,Iran,US economic sanctions,trump regime,maximalist policy,graft,corruption,daily life in Iran,iran,people,oil,tehran,government,sanction,country",

China and the United States last week said they were reviving talks ahead of the meeting between presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. Hopes that it will lead to a de-escalation of a trade war that is damaging the global economy has cheered financial markets. Talks to reach a broad deal broke down last month after U.S. officials accused China of backing away from previously agreed commitments. Speaking at a news briefing on the G20 summit, Wang, who is also part of the trade negotiating team with the United States, said talks between the two countries’ trade teams were underway, though he gave no details. China’s principles are clear, he said - mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit and meeting each other halfway. “Mutual respect means each side must respect the other’s sovereignty,” Wang said. “Equality and mutual benefit means the consultations have to happen on an equal basis, the agreement to be reached has to be beneficial for both sides,” he said. “Meeting each other half way means both sides have to compromise and make concessions, not just one side.” Wang declined to answer a question about what specific compromises Xi may offer to win a trade deal with Trump. Both the Chinese and U.S. teams are making preparations for the Xi-Trump meeting, Assistant Foreign Minister Zhang Jun told the same briefing, again without offering details. The two countries are in the middle of a costly trade dispute and have slapped increasingly severe tariffs on each other’s imports. China has vowed to not give in on issues of principle nor under U.S. pressure. Trump has threatened to put tariffs on another $325 billion (£255 billion) of goods, covering nearly all the remaining Chinese imports into the United States, including consumer products such as cellphones, computers and clothing. Wang said rising protectionism has dampened global trade and posed a threat to the global economy, while Chen Yulu, a vice governor of China’s central bank, warned that global economic and financial risks are rising significantly. “Signs of reversing monetary policy in major developed countries are becoming more evident,” Chen told the same briefing. “At the same time, policy room of many countries after the crisis has been reduced and room for coping with a sharp economic slowdown is limited.” Last week, the Federal Reserve signalled interest rate cuts beginning as early as July to cope with growing economic risks, which analysts say could increase pressure on China’s central bank to ease policy to support the slowing economy. Another problem is U.S. sanctions on Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies Co Inc. Wang said that Xi, when speaking by telephone to Trump last week, had said he hopes the United States can fairly treat Chinese companies. “We hope that the U.S. can remove certain unilateral measures inappropriately taken against Chinese companies, in the spirit of free trade and the World Trade Organisation.” The Trump administration has accused China of failing to protect intellectual property rights, forced technology transfers and of failing to provide a level playing field for U.S. companies. China has repeatedly promised to open its market wider to foreign investors and provide them with better services and treatment. China has also denied accusations of failing to protect intellectual property rights or of forcing foreign companies to transfer technology.

Tension is running high between long-time foes Iran and the United States after U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday said he called off a military strike to retaliate for Iran’s downing of a U.S. drone. However, Yahoo News reported on Thursday that the United States had launched cyber attacks, even as Trump backed away from a conventional attack. The Washington Post said on Saturday that the cyber strikes, which were previously planned, had disabled Iranian rocket launch systems. U.S. officials have declined to comment. “They try hard, but have not carried out a successful attack,” Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi, Iran’s minister for information and communications technology, said on Twitter. “Media asked if the claimed cyber attacks against Iran are true,” he said. “Last year we neutralized 33 million attacks with the (national) firewall.” Azari Jahromi called attacks on Iranian computer networks “cyberterrorism,” referring to Stuxnet, a computer virus widely believed to have been developed by the United States and Israel, which was discovered in 2010 after it was used to attack a uranium enrichment facility in the Iranian city of Natanz. The United States has also accused Iran of stepping up cyber attacks. Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman, Abbas Mousavi, said Iran’s cyber defence system was strong, and that Iran could legally pursue such aggression in international courts. He was quoted by ISNA news agency as saying that Tehran welcomed “defusion of tensions” in the region. “We do not want rise of tensions and its consequences.” Last year, Trump withdrew the United States from a 2015 accord between Iran and world powers that curbed Tehran’s nuclear program in exchange for easing sanctions. Relations in the region have worsened significantly since then. Trump said on Sunday he was not seeking war with Iran and would be prepared to seek a deal to bolster its flagging economy, an apparent move to defuse tensions. Trump has suggested that he backed off a military strike against Iran because he was not sure the country’s top leadership had intended to shoot down the drone. However, an Iranian commander said Tehran was prepared to do it again. “Everyone saw the downing of the unmanned drone,” navy commander Rear Admiral Hossein Khanzadi was quoted on Sunday as saying by the Tasnim news agency. “I can assure you that this firm response can be repeated, and the enemy knows it.” "|"U.S. cyber attacks on Iranian targets not successful, minister says"|"2019-06-24T01:11:56-0400"|"International,iran,us,cyber attack,rocket launch system,malicious cyber activity,Department of Homeland Security,Stuxnet,united,Iran,United States,trump,attack,cyber,tehran",

The blasts occurred at a military base near Arys in the former Soviet republic’s southern Turkestan province, which houses a large Soviet-era storage facility for explosive munitions. The cause of the fire which led to the explosions was unclear. Similar incidents in the area, in 2009, 2014 and 2015, were blamed on negligence and failure to observe safety regulations. Videos posted by local residents showed frightened people staring at a giant cloud of smoke and dust rising from the site, accompanied by thunder-like noise of more munitions exploding. Another video showed agitated soldiers screaming profanities as they run out of the military base in full gear, stepping on shattered glass. They can be seen stopping two cars on a nearby highway and ordering the drivers to take away several civilian women they had escorted out of the facility. The soldiers drop to the ground as more explosions are heard. Provincial governor Umirzak Shukeyev told a briefing that one person has been killed and 31 injured. The authorities warned locals against trying to return to the town because unexploded shells could turn its streets into minefields. “The scale (of fires) is very large and this could go on for a few days,” Shukeyev said. Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev wrote on Twitter he had ordered the government to ensure the safety of the local population and investigate the cause of the blasts.

The call came less than a month after a towering cruise ship collided with a dock and a tourist boat in Venice, injuring four people and rekindling a heated debate in Italy about how to protect the historic city, which draws some 30 million tourists a year. “Venice is unique and we cannot allow it to be destroyed even more than it has been already,” said Mariarita Signorini, national president of Italia Nostra (Our Italy), whose stated mission is to defend Italy’s cultural and natural heritage. The high cost of bucket-list tourism - and where you can go to get far from the madding crowd “Venice is one of the most endangered cities in the world,” she told a news conference announcing the decision to ask the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) to put the city on its List of World Heritage in Danger. Venice and its lagoon are already on UNESCO’s list of World Heritage Sites but Italia Nostra says unbridled tourism, a steady exodus of long-time residents and environmental decay pose a huge threat to the city’s survival. According to UNESCO’s website, the danger list is meant to “encourage corrective action.” While being put on the danger list would have no immediate consequences, Italia Nostra argues that this would compel national authorities to enact more safeguards. It was not immediately clear what Venice’s prospects were for being included on the list, which currently has 54 sites worldwide, some of them but by no means all in conflict zones. The June 2 collision between MSC Cruises’ massive 2,679-passenger Opera and the moored “River Countess,” which had 110 people on board, reignited calls for banning giant ships. The accident conjured up memories of the 2012 accident involving the Costa Concordia, which overturned after hitting rocks near the island of Giglio, killing 32 people. “If something like that happened in the lagoon, it would be the end of the ecosystem,” said Lidia Fersuoch, head of Italia Nostra in Venice. “Venice is not just buildings. The lagoon is a living thing.” Cruise ships enter the lagoon via one of the three “mouths” that connect it to the Adriatic Sea, pass near St. Marks Square and go through the Giudecca Canal to reach a passenger terminal.

Brig. Gen. Asamnew Tsige was killed on the outskirts of Bahir Dar, capital of the northern Amhara region, Nigussu Tilahun, a spokesman in the prime minister’s office, told The Associated Press. Ethiopian forces had been hunting down Asamnew since he and soldiers loyal to him attacked a meeting of the Amhara government in the regional capital Saturday, killing the regional governor and his adviser. The region’s attorney-general died of his wounds on Monday, according to local media reports. The attack Saturday was followed hours later by the assassination in the national capital, Addis Ababa, of the chief of Ethiopia’s military and a retired army general by a bodyguard. The killings were widely seen as an attack on Ethiopia’s reformist Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who has pushed through sweeping reforms since his election last year. Asamnew, the renegade general blamed for the violence, had been pardoned by Abiy after being jailed by the previous government for allegedly plotting a coup. He had recently used social media posts to incite a rebellion in Amhara, according to reports in the Ethiopian media. The shootout in which Asamnew was killed comes as the government roots out others suspected of supporting the rebellion. Four high-ranking officials in Amhara, including the deputy head of security there, were taken into custody Monday, according to Abere Adamu, chief of the Amhara police commission. Another 178 people have also been arrested on suspicion of taking part in violence in the region, he said. An internet shutdown has been in force across Ethiopia since Saturday’s killings. Flags flew at half-mast throughout Ethiopia on Monday, which was declared a day of national mourning following Saturday’s violence. Addis Ababa was peaceful as soldiers stood guard in Meskel Square and manned roadblocks throughout the capital. The 42-year-old Abiy has initiated sweeping political and economic reforms, including the surprise acceptance of a peace agreement with neighbouring Eritrea, the opening of major state-owned sectors to private investment and the release of thousands of political prisoners, including opposition figures once sentenced to death. Although Abiy’s reforms are widely popular, some members of the previous regime are unhappy with the changes and the prime minister has survived a number of threats. Last June, a grenade meant for Abiy killed two people and wounded many others at a big rally. Nine police officials were arrested, state media reported. In October, rebellious soldiers protesting over salaries invaded Abiy’s office, but the prime minister was able to defuse the situation. Ethiopia is a key regional ally of the U.S. in the restive Horn of Africa region. Tibor Nagy, U.S. assistant secretary of state for Africa, said the latest violence was a “shock, but it could have turned out so much worse.” “Thankfully Prime Minister Abiy escaped this attempt, because there are many, many more people in Ethiopia who support his reforms than those who are opposed to them,” he told reporters Sunday in Pretoria, South Africa. Adding that “there are vestiges of the old regime” who are opposed to Abiy, Nagy said: “I wish I could say that this is will be the last of these attempts, but no one can be certain.” Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day’s most important headlines.

"408"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-elliot-roberts-manager-of-rock-stars-is-dead-at-76-2/"|"Ben Sisario"|"Elliot Roberts, who managed the careers of musical stars Joni Mitchell, David Crosby, Jackson Browne, Tom Petty, Tracy Chapman and others but was best known for his five-decade association with Neil Young, died on Friday in Los Angeles. He was 76. His company, Lookout Management, announced the death but did not state a cause. Few pop artists have had business relationships as close and long-lasting as the one Mr. Young had with Mr. Roberts. After they met in a Los Angeles recording studio in 1967, Mr. Roberts became Mr. Young’s advocate, adviser and comic foil. In a remembrance posted on his website on Saturday, Mr. Young wrote: “When it came to our business, Elliot guided me through every move. We talked every day. Often I would call him multiple times a day, arguing, discussing, planning and sharing. He was there for me and protected my music with a fierceness.” Along with David Geffen, Mr. Roberts was one of the crucial figures behind the singer-songwriter scene in Southern California in the late 1960s and early ’70s. The catalyst for both men’s rise was Ms. Mitchell, whom Roberts saw perform at the Café Au Go Go in New York’s Greenwich Village in 1967. She had a growing catalogue of innovative, powerful songs, but no recording deal. “I went up to her after the show and said, ‘I’m a young manager, and I’d kill to work with you,’ ” Mr. Roberts told Vanity Fair in 2015. He became her manager, and Mr. Geffen became her booking agent. After Mr. Roberts secured Ms. Mitchell a deal with Reprise Records, the two relocated to Los Angeles, where in late 1967 she began recording her debut album, Song to a Seagull, at the Sunset Sound studio in Hollywood. The album’s producer was David Crosby of the Byrds, whom Ms. Mitchell had recently met on tour in Florida. (Mr. Crosby also became client of Mr. Roberts.) Also at Sunset Sound at the time of those sessions was Buffalo Springfield, Mr. Young’s band, which was recording what would become its final album, Last Time Around. Ms. Mitchell had known Mr. Young from the Canadian folk scene and introduced him to her manager. Months later, after Buffalo Springfield disbanded, Mr. Young asked Mr. Roberts to manage his solo career. Before long, Mr. Roberts and Mr. Geffen had emerged as kingpins of the new scene. They helped secure a record deal for a band that Mr. Crosby had formed with Stephen Stills and Graham Nash – a feat that included extricating Mr. Crosby and Mr. Nash from their existing contracts – and later added Mr. Young to the group. In 1971, Mr. Roberts and Mr. Geffen founded Asylum Records, and many of the artists on the label’s early roster, such as the Eagles and Mr. Browne, were managed by the company the two men had set up, Geffen-Roberts. While Mr. Geffen became known as a shrewd if ruthless mogul-in-training, Mr. Roberts took part in the rock ′n’ roll lifestyle of his clients. Mr. Crosby once described him in a Rolling Stone interview as “a cat who is like us.” Yet, within the business, Mr. Roberts also had a reputation for vigorous advocacy on behalf of his clients. That included taking advantage of the uncertainty that followed a corporate regime change at Warner Communications in the mid-1990s to secure a US$25-million deal for Mr. Young, according to Exploding: The Highs, Hits, Heroes, and Hustlers of the Warner Music Group, a 2002 book by Stan Cornyn, a former Warner Bros. executive. “Elliot Roberts was probably the kindest, gentlest, and far and away the funniest man I ever worked with in show business,” Mr. Stills said in a statement. “He was also tough as a barbed-wire fence, fiercely loyal and keenly observant.” Mr. Roberts was born Elliot Rabinowitz in the Bronx borough of New York on Feb. 25, 1943. By his early 20s he was climbing the lower rungs of the entertainment business. He worked in the mail room of the William Morris Agency in New York, where he met Mr. Geffen, then a young agent. He also managed a rock band, Robert’s Rules of Order, around this time. He changed his legal name to Elliot Roberts in 1967. He leaves his sons Jason, Ethan, Matthew and Zackary, and his partner, Dana Fineman. Mr. Roberts’s management partnership with Mr. Geffen had dissolved by the mid-1970s. Asylum had been sold to Warner Bros., and Mr. Geffen had sold his shares in the Geffen-Roberts management company to Mr. Roberts. Mr. Roberts represented Ms. Mitchell until 1985, and at points in the 1970s and ’80s, he worked with Tom Petty, Devo, the Cars, Yes, Ms. Chapman and Bob Dylan. More recently, he and his company, Lookout, represented Spiritualized, Mazzy Star and Devendra Banhart. But Mr. Roberts never stopped working with Mr. Young. “He was my best friend in the world for so many years,” Mr. Young wrote in his tribute.

"409"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-sudans-military-sidesteps-proposal-for-civilian-rule/"|"Hussein Malla And Samy Magdy"|"Sudan’s military rulers refused to agree on Monday to the Ethiopian proposal for a power-sharing agreement with the country’s pro-democracy movement, a top general said, in comments that could worsen a volatile standoff with the protesters. Ethiopia has led diplomatic efforts to bring the military and protest leaders back to the negotiating table, after a deadly crackdown by security forces killed at least 128 people across the country earlier this month, according to protest organizers. Sudanese authorities offered a lower toll of 61 deaths. Protest leaders, represented by the coalition Forces for Declaration of Freedom and Change, had accepted the Ethiopian initiative the day before. It centred on forming a transitional government – a so-called “sovereign council” – with a civilian majority to rule Sudan, over two months after the protesters forced the military to remove the autocrat Omar al-Bashir from power. But on Monday, the powerful deputy head of the military council, Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, said the mission of the Ethiopian envoy, Mahmoud Dirir, was to pave the way for resuming talks with the FDFC, “not to offer proposals for solutions.” “The mission of the Ethiopian mediator was limited to prepare the parties for negotiations. We did not agree on shares in the sovereign council. We do not accept prescriptions,” he said. Dagalo, better known as Hemedti, said the ruling military council did not oppose civilian participation in the future sovereign council – or that the FDFC might form the government. He added that the transitional legislative body “should be (formed) through elections.” He also said the military council decided to release all detained rebels, to pave the way for peace talks with rebel groups in the provinces. Dagalo is the leader of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, which grew out of the notorious Janjaweed militias. The RSF led a violent campaign against insurgents in Darfur – and now stands accused of involvement in protester deaths in Sudan’s main cities. In a news conference on Sunday, the military council had said the previous deals with the protest leaders were invalid, given the changes on the ground in Sudan since talks collapsed in May. A spokesman for the council, Gen. Shams Eddin Kabashi, said: “The circumstances in which we reached such understandings … are not the same.” Previously, both sides had agreed on an interim legislative body and Cabinet formed by the protesters. They had still not reached agreement on the extent of the military’s role in the planned sovereign council, which would guide the nation throughout the three-year transition period, when security forces launched the deadly clampdown on June 3. The movement has since tried different tactics – including a short-lived nationwide strike, and nighttime marches to keep up pressure on the military. Ismail al-Tag, a spokesman for the Sudanese Professionals’ Association which is a member of the FDFC, called on Monday for marches next week demanding the handover of power to civilians. The demonstrations are planned to mark the 30th anniversary of the Islamist-backed coup that brought al-Bashir’s to power in 1989 – and toppled Sudan’s last elected government. Meanwhile on Monday, police forces used tear gas to disperse dozens of protesters in the capital, Khartoum. The clashes broke out in the district of Buri – a stronghold of the protest movement. Demonstrators hurled stones at police before fleeing inside the National Ribat University campus. An Associated Press photographer saw officers arresting a number of people, before taking them blindfolded into police trucks. The FDFC had called on Sunday for trust-building measures from the military before resuming talks. These included a demand for an independent investigation into the violence on June 3. It had also demanded that the military-backed authorities restore the country’s severed internet services. On Monday, the United Nations’ human rights chief said the military council had not responded to a request for co-operation with its office for investigating alleged human rights crimes, including the rape and sexual abuse of both women and men, in the deaths of protesters. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet also urged authorities to “immediately” restore internet connections. Amany el-Taweel, head of the African program at al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies in Egypt, said the military cancelling previous deals with the protest leaders boded badly for the situation in Sudan. “We are back to square one,” she said. She said the military had been exploiting time, as the number of the street protests has fallen.

"410"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-british-pm-candidate-jeremy-hunt-calls-boris-johnson-a-coward-for/"|"Guy Faulconbridge Kate Holton"|"Jeremy Hunt, one of the two candidates vying to replace British Prime Minister Theresa May, said on Monday that rival Boris Johnson was a coward for avoiding public head-to-head debates on what to do about Brexit. “On the question of debates, he is being a coward,” Mr. Hunt said. “It is cowardice not to appear in head-to-head debates.” Mr. Hunt, 52, said it was disrespectful for Mr. Johnson to have turned down the opportunity for a head-to-head debate on Sky television. Sky has cancelled the debate as Mr. Johnson declined to take part. “People need to know what you’re going to do and you need to answer those questions,” Mr. Hunt said. “I promise Boris Johnson the fight of his life and he’s going to have that and he’s going to lose.” Mr. Johnson, 55, is the favourite to win a vote of 160,000 Conservative Party members who will decide who will be the next prime minister. Betting markets give him a 79-per-cent implied probability of winning the top job, down from 92 per cent last week. He has cast himself as the only candidate who can deliver Brexit on Oct. 31 – with or without a deal – while fighting off the electoral threats of Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party and socialist Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party. Early on Friday, police were called to Mr. Johnson’s home after neighbours heard a loud altercation between him and his girlfriend. Police said there was no cause for police action. The Guardian newspaper, which first reported the story, said an unidentified neighbour had heard Johnson’s girlfriend, Carrie Symonds, screaming followed by “slamming and banging”. At one point Ms. Symonds could be heard telling Mr. Johnson to “get off me” and “get out of my flat”. Mr. Johnson declined to answer questions about the incident at a hustings event in Birmingham on Saturday. A spokesman for Ms. May declined to comment on the row. A Survation poll of Conservative voters showed Mr. Johnson’s lead over Mr. Hunt had halved from 27 percentage points to just 11 since news of the altercation broke. Mr. Hunt said the personal life of Mr. Johnson was irrelevant but that the candidates should explain their Brexit positions – and specifically what would a new leader do if lawmakers tried to sink a new government heading towards a no-deal Brexit. “If parliament takes no-deal off the table before Oct. 31, will Boris call a general election?” Mr. Hunt said. “I think a general election would be catastrophic.” Mr. Hunt said he would seek a better deal from the European Union to leave on Oct. 31 and would, if absolutely necessary, leave without a deal. If parliament took a no-deal Brexit off the table, he intimated there would have to be delay. “In that situation, you would have to carry on negotiating,” Mr. Hunt said. “I want to leave by Oct. 31 but if parliament stops it the prime minister has to obey the law.” Mr. Johnson repeated on Monday that he would lead the United Kingdom out of the EU on Oct. 31 with or without a deal. “We are going to come out of the EU on October 31,” he wrote in the Daily Telegraph. “This time we are not going to bottle it.” Like Mr. Hunt, Mr. Johnson promised lower taxes if he wins the top job. When asked the naughtiest thing he had ever done, Mr. Hunt said: “When I was backpacking through India, I once had a bhang lassi – which is a kind of cannabis lassi – that’s the naughtiest thing I am prepared to confess to on this programme.” Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day’s most important headlines.

"411"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-trump-to-visit-south-korea-after-exchange-of-letters-with-kim-jong-un/"|"Hyonhee Shin Jeff Mason"|"U.S. President Donald Trump will visit South Korea this weekend after an exchange of letters with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un boosted hopes for a resumption of talks aimed at ending North Korea’s nuclear program. Trump is set to arrive in South Korea for a two-day visit on Saturday, and will meet President Moon Jae-in on Sunday, following a summit of G20 leaders in Japan, Moon’s spokeswoman, Ko Min-jung, said on Monday. The announcement came hours after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he hoped a letter Trump sent to Kim could pave the way for a revival of talks that have been stalled since a failed second summit between Trump and Kim in February. Trump and Moon would have “in-depth discussions on ways to work together to foster lasting peace,” Ko told a news briefing. Trump told reporters at the White House that Kim had sent him birthday wishes. “It was just a very friendly letter both ways. We have a very good relationship,” he said. Pompeo, who spoke of Trump’s letter to Kim before leaving Washington on Sunday for a trip to the Middle East and Asia, said Washington was ready to resume talks with North Korea immediately. “I’m hopeful that this will provide a good foundation for us to begin … these important discussions with the North Koreans,” Pompeo told reporters. Trump is considering a visit to the demilitarized zone (DMZ) separating the two Koreas, a South Korean official said. Trump wanted to go there on a 2017 trip to South Korea but heavy fog prevented it. Kim and Moon held their historic first summit in the DMZ last year, so a Trump visit there this weekend would spark speculation of a possible meeting with Kim. Another official in the South Korean presidential office said she was not aware of any plan for Trump to meet Kim and the White House has not commented on the possibility. Trump and Kim held their first, groundbreaking summit in Singapore in June last year, agreeing to establish new relations and work toward the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. But a second summit in Vietnam in February collapsed when the two sides were unable to bridge differences between U.S. demands for denuclearization and North Korean demands for sanctions relief. The director of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, Lieutenant General Robert Ashley, told Fox News on Monday that the intelligence community continued to assess that Kim Jong Un is not ready to give up his nuclear weapons. Stephen Biegun, the U.S. special envoy for North Korea, said on Wednesday Washington had no preconditions for talks, but that progress would require meaningful and verifiable North Korean steps to denuclearize. The State Department said Biegun, who led working-level talks with North Korea in the run-up to the Hanoi summit, would visit Seoul from Thursday until Sunday for meetings with South Korean officials. Tension mounted last month when North Korea test-fired a series of short-range ballistic missiles, though Trump and South Korea both played down the tests. One June 11, Trump said he had received a very warm, “beautiful” letter from Kim, adding he thought something positive would happen. North Korea’s state news agency KCNA said on Sunday Kim had received a letter from Trump, which he described as being “of excellent content,” but did not disclose any details. KCNA said Kim “would seriously contemplate the interesting content.” Shin Beom-chul, a senior fellow at the Asian Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul, said Trump may have proposed a new round of working-level talks but a major breakthrough was unlikely for now. “North Korea has to show what the final state of denuclearization would look like and what road map it has toward that end, but it’s not desirable to reopen talks just to manage the situation after recent weapons tests,” Shin told Reuters. Pompeo, who will also be in Seoul for Trump’s visit, did not discuss the contents of the president’s letter, but said Washington had been working to lay foundations for discussions. “I think we’re in a better place,” he said. Asked if working-level discussions would begin soon, Pompeo said: “I think the remarks you saw out of North Korea this morning suggest that may well be a very good possibility. We’re ready to go, we’re literally prepared to go at a moment’s notice if the North Koreans indicate that they’re prepared for those discussions.” Joseph Yun, Biegun’s predecessor as special envoy for North Korea, told a panel discussion at Washington’s Center for Strategic and International Studies he expected there to be a third summit between Trump and Kim and this would probably take place “sooner rather than later.” Victor Cha, a former White House official involved in past negotiations with North Korea, told the same event he expected Trump to go to the DMZ and noted Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit to North Korea last week. “Whenever you see high-level letter and then the Chinese and North Koreans meeting, that’s kind of like the set-up for a third meeting,” he said. “The question is, is he going to make a big statement at the DMZ … is he going to do it with President Moon. Are there going to be other surprises? This president likes surprises.” Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day’s most important headlines. Sign up today.

"412"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-woman-three-children-found-dead-near-border-in-texas-sheriff/"|"Cedar Attanasio David Warren"|"Two babies, a toddler and a woman were found dead near the U.S.-Mexican border, overcome by the sweltering heat in a glimpse of what could lie ahead this summer as record numbers of migrant families try to get into the United States. Authorities believe the four may have been dead for days before the bodies were discovered on Sunday in the Rio Grande Valley. No details were released on the victims’ relationship. It was the latest grim discovery of migrants who died while trying to cross the perilous desert and the swollen Rio Grande. A law enforcement official close to the investigation told The Associated Press the four were overcome by the heat after fording the river. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Migrant families have been coming over the border in unprecedented numbers in recent months, reaching a peak in May, when 84,000 adults and children travelling together were apprehended. Nearly 500,000 immigrants have been detained at the border since the start of the year, resulting in dangerous overcrowding in U.S. holding centres. A total of 283 migrant deaths were recorded along the 2,000-mile border last year. The death toll so far this year was not immediately released. Three children and an adult from Honduras are believed to have died after their raft overturned on the Rio Grande in April. They had considered seeking asylum but were daunted by a long wait list to get into the U.S., according to a shelter official who met the family. A 6-year-old immigrant from India was found dead in the triple-digit heat in Arizona this month, and seven people believed to be migrants died in June alone in irrigation canals that run alongside border barriers near El Paso. The total last year for such deaths in those canals was 11. Border Patrol spokesman Ramiro Cordero said that in past years, agents would be posted near canals and hear the cries of help from migrants. But they are doing other duties this year with so many immigrants showing up, some in poor health. “Unfortunately, because of the large influx of illegal aliens and agents having to be diverted to other duties, such as transporting, hospital escorts … there are not a lot of agents readily available to hear these cries,” he said in a statement. The Trump administration is also under siege from critics who believe it is taking too hard a line toward humanitarian volunteers who help border crossers by leaving jugs of water in the desert and providing medical assistance. The Justice Department prosecuted a volunteer with the aid group No More Deaths on conspiracy charges for providing two migrants with water, food and lodging last year. He faced up to 20 years in prison, but the case ended in a mistrial earlier this month when the jury deadlocked. The immigrants who make it across the border and turn themselves in to authorities are experiencing their own problems and safety risks in government detention. Five children have died after being detained by the government since late last year, and dozens of youngsters were found last week in unsanitary conditions inside a Border Patrol station near El Paso. The government had transferred the majority of the children out of the facility by Monday. Authorities say the weather is one factor in some of the recent deaths. Higher-than-average snowfall in the Rocky Mountains is sending more water into the Rio Grande and adjacent canals, creating deceptively swift waters. Border agents say they are rescuing immigrants from the river on an almost daily basis. Customs and Border Protection agents have responded to 3,330 rescue emergencies since the start of the fiscal year Oct. 1. Those numbers typically spike in the coming months as triple-digit heat becomes the norm. During the last budget year, Customs and Border Protection rescue teams responded to more than 4,300 emergencies. The irrigation canals near El Paso look calm on the surface and easy to cross, but their V-shape creates a quick undertow, and it is difficult to climb out of them. “They don’t realize that once they get in there, their feet can get swept away. There’s a lot of obstacles, there’s debris in the canal, and there are headgates,” which can trap or stop people, said Capt. Kris Menendez, head of the El Paso County Water Rescue Team. The team was training near a headgate on June 11 when one of the firefighters spotted a body in the water. By the time they got in the water, there were two bodies – one a preschool-age girl, and the other a 30-year-old man. The names of the four who died in the Rio Grande were not immediately released, and authorities were working to determine their country of origin. The bodies were found in or near a park that borders the river in the city of Mission, Hidalgo County sheriff’s Sgt. Frank Medrano said. The FBI is leading the investigation because the park is on federal land. Medrano said the area is commonly used by migrants entering the country illegally. “It’s a well-known route because it’s so close to the border,” he said.

Rocco Morabito and three other inmates got out “through the roof” of a prison in Montevideo around midnight before making their way “through a neighbouring farm and robbing its owner,” a ministry statement said. Morabito has been on the run from Italy since 1994 and has been sentenced there to 30 years in prison for drug trafficking. Italian prosecutors say Morabito, 52, played a large role in operations between South America and Milan, which is a distribution point for illegal drugs. The fugitive has also been described as a key figure in the Calabria-based ‘Ndrangheta mob, one of the world’s biggest movers of cocaine. “It’s disconcerting and serious that a criminal like Rocco Morabito, a boss of Ndrangheta, has managed to escape from an Uruguay prison while waiting to be extradited to Italy,” Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini said on Twitter. “I’m making two pledges: shedding full light on the escape, asking for immediate explanations from the Montevideo government, and chasing Morabito, wherever he is, to throw him in prison as he deserves.” Morabito was arrested in 2017 at a hotel in the Uruguayan capital, although he had been living in a villa with its own swimming pool in the seaside city of Punta del Este. At the time, Uruguayan police confiscated a 9 mm gun, 13 cellphones and $54,000 in cash as well as a luxury Mercedes coupe. He had been living under an alias for about a decade and using a false Brazilian passport. The other three men who escaped with him have been identified as Leonardo Abel Sinopoli Azcoaga, who had been detained for robbery and falsifying documents and is wanted by Brazil; Matias Sebastian Acosta Gonzalez, who was awaiting extradition to Brazil; and Bruno Ezequiel Diaz, who had been detained for homicide after a request by Argentina. Uruguay’s police released photos of the four fugitives and asked for the public’s help to find them.

About 100 demonstrators jammed the entryway and lobby of the Inland Revenue Tower, a skyscraper in the Wan Chai district in the city centre. Earlier, one of the main protest groups announced a demonstration planned on Wednesday to try to draw the attention of world leaders attending the G20 summit in Japan. The leaders of the Civil Human Rights Front said they hope the world leaders meeting in Osaka will hear the protesters’ concerns over the weakening of the city’s legal autonomy by mainland China. Hundreds of thousands of people have filled the streets and sidewalks in recent weeks to oppose legislation seen as increasing Beijing’s control and police treatment of the protesters. The activists spoke on Monday near the city government headquarters, where a few protesters remained though the offices in the building had reopened. Kelvin Ho, one of the group’s several leaders, said the protest was meant to “urge the international community to give stress on Beijing that we need democracy.” China has rejected foreign commentary over the protests and the extradition issue as interference in its internal affairs. At a briefing in Beijing, Zhang Jun, an assistant foreign minister, said, “I can tell you that for sure the G20 will not discuss the issue of Hong Kong and we will not allow the G20 to discuss the issue of Hong Kong.” Hong Kong’s government “has taken a series of measures to safeguard fairness and justice of society and to block loopholes in the legal system. We believe what they have done is completely necessary and the central government supports these measures,” he said. Joshua Wong, another activist who helped galvanize mass pro-democracy protests in 2014, said on Twitter that he was urging his followers to join the protest on Wednesday. Pro-democracy activists and legislators and others critical of the extradition bill have insisted they are not satisfied with apologies from the authorities over the handling of the unpopular legislation and over police moves during protests that many Hong Kong residents considered overly aggressive. Hong Kong has a separate legal system from the rest of China under an agreement struck before Beijing took control of the former British colony in 1997. The extradition legislation would enable some suspects to be sent from Hong Kong to stand trial in mainland Chinese courts. The opponents’ concern is that suspects might be pursued for corrupt or political reasons and be unable to get fair trials in courts dominated by the ruling Chinese Communist Party. Bonnie Leung, another leader in the Civil Human Rights Front, said the extradition bill, which has been indefinitely shelved for now, would affect not just Hong Kong residents but potentially anyone visiting the city. “The whole world who have connection with [Hong Kong] would be stakeholders,” she said. “This is not about a power struggle. This is about the values that make the world a better place, such as the rule of law.” “If you also treasure these values, please speak up and do speak up before it is too late,” she said. Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, who has apologized over the controversy but refused calls to step down, said the legislation was needed to ensure criminals would not use the territory to evade capture and to meet international standards such as rules against money laundering.

The Preah Sihanouk provincial court said Tuesday the construction owner was charged with unintentional homicide and the three other Chinese were charged with conspiracy. The four were put in pretrial detention. The charges carry a penalty of up to three years in jail. The unfinished condominium doubled as housing for the workers who were building the seven-story structure. It collapsed early Saturday as they slept on the second floor. Rescuers found the last two survivors and the final victims Monday. Twenty-eight people died and 26 were injured.

The survey of over 150,000 people from 57 countries by German polling firm Dalia Research and Alliance of Democracies Foundation found that even in democracies, 38% of people are dissatisfied with the state of affairs. “Right now, the biggest risk for democracies is that the public no longer sees them as democratic,” Nico Jaspers, CEO of Dalia Research, said in a statement. People surveyed in the United States, where the 2020 presidential elections are ramping up, were split as to whether their country was democratic — 46 per cent said it was and 40 per cent said it was not democratic enough. Over half of Americans surveyed said the U.S. has had a positive impact on democracy around the world, though majorities in Western countries such as Canada and most of Europe felt the impact had been negative. In Europe, 52 per cent thought the EU does not act in the interest of most Europeans, with the most criticism coming from Italy, France and Greece. The survey was released a few days before the EU’s 28 leaders are due to decide the bloc’s top jobs in a process criticised by some for not being democratic enough. In Italy, where eurosceptic parties won last year’s election and are now in government, 69 per cent thought the EU’s decisions do not represent the interests of the population. Most Europeans thought banks and the financial industry have had a negative impact on democracy in their countries, with Greece being the most critical, the survey found, a decade after a debt crisis that sent many Greeks into poverty. Globally, 52 per cent did not feel their countries were prepared for another financial crisis. Over 40 per cent of people surveyed in the United States, Canada and Austria, among other countries, felt that social media such as Facebook and Twitter had a negative impact on democracy.

"417"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-us-sanctions-on-irans-supreme-leader-ayatollah-ali-khamenei-means-end/"|"Parisa Hafezi Steve Holland"|"U.S. President Donald Trump threatened on Tuesday to obliterate parts of Iran if it attacked “anything American,” in a new war of words with Iran, which condemned fresh U.S. sanctions on Tehran as “mentally retarded.” But Mr. Trump later left the door open for talks, saying that Iran should speak to the United States “peaceably” to ease tensions and potentially lift U.S. economic sanctions. The U.S. president on Monday signed an executive order imposing additional, largely symbolic, sanctions against Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and other senior figures, with punitive measures against Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif expected later this week. Iran shot down a U.S. drone last week and Mr. Trump said he had called off a retaliatory air strike with minutes to spare, saying too many people would have been killed. It would have been the first time the United States had bombed the Islamic Republic in four decades of mutual hostility. In rhetoric similar to the kind of harsh words he used to aim at North Korea, Mr. Trump tweeted: “Any attack by Iran on anything American will be met with great and overwhelming force. In some areas, overwhelming will mean obliteration.” In a televised address on Tuesday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said the new sanctions against Mr. Khamenei would have no practical impact because the top cleric had no assets abroad. Mr. Rouhani, a pragmatist who won two elections on promises to open Iran up to the world, said the White House’s actions were “mentally retarded” – an insult that other Iranian officials have used in the past about Mr. Trump, but a departure from Mr. Rouhani’s own comparatively measured tone over the years. “Tehran’s strategic patience does not mean we have fear,” said Mr. Rouhani, who with his cabinet runs Iran’s day-to-day affairs while Mr. Khamenei, in power since 1989, is the country’s ultimate authority. But Mr. Trump, speaking to reporters at the White House, said Iran would let the United States know what it wanted to do, including negotiate. “Whatever they want to do, I’m ready,” Mr. Trump said. “Their country is not doing well economically at all. That could be changed very quickly, very easily,” Mr. Trump said. “But they have to get rid of the hostility from the leadership. The leadership – I hope they stay, I hope they do a great job – but they should talk to us peaceably.” The United States has imposed crippling financial sanctions against Iran since last year when Mr. Trump withdrew from a 2015 deal between Tehran and world powers under which Iran curbed its nuclear program. Tension has escalated sharply this past month when the Trump administration tightened its sanctions noose, ordering all countries to halt purchases of Iranian oil. That has effectively starved the Iranian economy of the main source of revenue Tehran uses to import food for its 81-million people, and left the pragmatic wing of Iran’s leadership, led by Mr. Rouhani, with no benefits to show for its nuclear agreement. Mr. Trump says the accord reached under his predecessor Barack Obama was a failure because its terms were not permanent and did not cover security issues beyond the nuclear program, such as missiles, and roles in various Middle East conflicts. The downing of the U.S. drone – which Iran says was over its air space and the United States says was in international skies – followed weeks of rising tensions that had begun to take on a military dimension. Mr. Trump’s hawkish national security adviser, John Bolton, who is visiting Israel, repeated earlier offers to hold talks, as long as Iran was willing to go beyond the terms of the 2015 deal. “The president has held the door open to real negotiations to completely and verifiably eliminate Iran’s nuclear weapons program, its pursuit of ballistic missile delivery systems, its support for international terrorism and other malign behaviour worldwide,” Mr. Bolton said in Jerusalem. “All that Iran needs to do is to walk through that open door.” Iran says there is no point negotiating with Washington when it has abandoned a deal that was already reached. Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said imposing “useless sanctions” on Mr. Khamenei and Mr. Zarif would mark “the permanent closure of the path of diplomacy.” Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned that the situation surrounding Iran was developing toward a dangerous scenario, the RIA news agency reported on Tuesday. The United States and some regional allies have blamed Iran for explosions that damaged tankers in the Gulf, which Tehran denies. Washington’s European allies have repeatedly warned both sides of the danger that a small mistake could lead to war. Tehran has given European signatories until July 8 to find a way to shield its economy from U.S. sanctions, or else it will enrich uranium to higher levels banned under the deal to help ensure no development of a nuclear weapon results. Acting U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said he hoped to recruit support from NATO allies in Brussels this week for U.S. efforts to deter conflict with Iran and “open the door to diplomacy,” as he made his first trip as Pentagon chief.

Investigators at U.S.-Israeli cyber security firm Cybereason said the attackers compromised companies in more than 30 countries and aimed to gather information on individuals in government, law-enforcement and politics. The hackers also used tools linked to other attacks attributed to Beijing by the United States and its Western allies, said Lior Div, chief executive of Cybereason. “For this level of sophistication it’s not a criminal group. It is a government that has capabilities that can do this kind of attack,” he told Reuters. China has repeatedly denied involvement in any hacking activity. Cybereason declined to name the companies affected or the countries they operate in, but people familiar with Chinese hacking operations said Beijing was increasingly targeting telcos in Western Europe. Western countries have moved to call out Beijing for its actions in cyberspace, warning that Chinese hackers have compromised companies and government agencies around the world to steal valuable commercial secrets and personal data for espionage purposes. Div said this latest campaign, which his team uncovered over the last nine months, compromised the internal IT network of some of those targeted, allowing the attackers to customise the infrastructure and steal vast amounts of data. In some instances, they managed to compromise a target’s entire active directory, giving them access to every username and password in the organisation. They also got hold of personal data, including billing information and call records, Cybereason said in a blog post. “They built a perfect espionage environment,” said Div, a former commander in Israel’s military intelligence unit 8200. “They could grab information as they please on the targets that they are interested in.” Cybereason said multiple tools used by the attackers had previously been used by a Chinese hacking group known as APT10. The United States indicted two alleged members of APT10 in December and joined other Western countries in denouncing the group’s attacks on global technology service providers to steal intellectual property from their clients. The company said on previous occasions it had identified attacks it suspected had come from China or Iran but it was never certain enough to name these countries. Cybereason said: “This time as opposed to in the past we are sure enough to say that the attack originated in China.” “We managed to find not just one piece of software, we managed to find more than five different tools that this specific group used,” Div said.

Geng Shuang gave no details at a daily briefing, but there are hopes the planned encounter at the G20 summit in Japan will help lower the temperature in the trade war between the world’s two largest economies. As part of preparations, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer spoke by phone Monday with the top Chinese negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He. “We certainly hope that the meeting will help the two states to promote mutual trust, resolve their differences, and resolve some of the outstanding issues we are facing now,” Geng said. China remains “committed to working with the U.S. to develop China-U.S. relations based on co-ordination and co-operation,” Geng said. The meeting in Osaka is the first opportunity for the two leaders to discuss the trade dispute face-to-face since Trump said he was ready to target the $300-billion in Chinese imports that he hasn’t already hit with tariffs, extending them to everything China ships to the United States. Trump has already imposed 25 per cent tariffs on $250-billion in Chinese imports and China has retaliated with tariffs on U.S. goods. The sides are at an impasse after 11 rounds of talks that have failed to overcome U.S. concerns over China’s acquisition of American technology and its massive trade surplus.

Washington and its allies have urged fellow NATO member Ankara not to install the S-400 system, saying that would let the technology learn how to recognize the F-35s, which are built to avoid tracking by enemy radars and heat sensors. But Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan vowed anew on Tuesday to press on with the S-400 purchase despite allies’ concerns. “We will hopefully start to receive the S-400 systems we purchased from Russia next month,” Erdogan told members of his AK Party in parliament. “Turkey is not a country that needs to seek permission or bow to pressures. The S-400s are directly linked to our sovereignty and we will not take a step back.” Turkey has said its S-400 deal with Russia is final, exacerbating a diplomatic rift with the United States already widening over conflicting strategy in Syria, Iran sanctions and the detention of U.S. consular staff. “Everything indicates that Russia is going to deliver the system to Turkey and that will have consequences,” Kay Bailey Hutchison, the U.S. ambassador to NATO, said in Brussels. “There will be a disassociation with the F-35 system, we cannot have the F-35 affected or destabilized by having this Russian system in the alliance,” she told reporters. The United States says the jets, made by Lockheed Martin Corp., give NATO forces a number of technological advantages in the air, including the ability to disrupt enemy communications networks and navigation signals. Turkey produces parts of the F-35s fuselage, landing gear and cockpit displays. Hutchison said Ankara was an important partner in that production but that security concerns about Russia were paramount. “So many of us have tried to dissuade Turkey,” she said. The United States offered Turkey the more expensive Patriot anti-missile defence system, and then with a discount, but there were issues with the U.S. ability to deliver the Patriots quickly. Turkey also says that NATO allies have not helped it during times of heightened security concerns, and it therefore had to seek alternatives, and Russia came into the picture. Germany and the United States stationed Patriot surface-to-air missile batteries in Turkey on a temporary basis in 2013 but moved them out in 2015, citing demands on assets elsewhere. Washington also warned Ankara that it will face U.S. sanctions over the agreement with Moscow, a move that could deal a significant blow to Turkey’s ailing economy and its defence industry. Turkey has dismissed the U.S. warnings, saying it would take the necessary measures to avoid complications, and proposed to form a joint working group with Washington to assess concerns. It has said U.S. officials have yet to respond to the offer. The Pentagon has already stopped training Turkish pilots on the jets. Erdogan is expected to discuss the issue with U.S. President Donald Trump at the G20 summit in Japan later this week. One senior NATO diplomat said that was probably the last chance of finding a solution. NATO defence ministers, who meet for two days in Brussels from Wednesday, are not planning to formally raise the issue, but there could be some diplomacy in informal meetings, diplomats said. “It’s not over until it’s over, but so far Turkey has not appeared to retract from the sale,” Hutchison. “The consequences will occur, we don’t feel there’s a choice in that.” Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day’s most important headlines.

"421"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-any-use-of-child-soldiers-by-papuan-independence-fighters-would-be-a/"|"Stephen Wright"|"An Indonesian military spokesman said Tuesday that any use of child soldiers by Papuan independence fighters would be a violation of human rights that implicates both the rebels and state institutions. The Associated Press reported last week that the long-simmering armed conflict between Indonesia’s military and the West Papua Liberation Army involves indigenous teenagers and boys who appear barely adolescent. The military’s spokesman in easternmost Papua, Muhammad Aidi, said in a statement that if armed Papuans have involved children in the conflict it would show they’re a “wild, uncivilized” group. “If there are two or more parties in conflict, all parties are obliged to provide protection to children, women and the elderly,” he said. The Indonesian military itself has been accused of killing civilians and other serious human rights violations in Papua since it became part of Indonesia in the early 1960s. More recently, Amnesty International said in a report last year that Indonesia’s police and military are responsible for at least 96 unlawful killings in the Papua region since 2010 and condemned a near total absence of justice for the mainly indigenous victims. Aidi also said if the state is failing to enforce the law against serious violations within its territory “it means that state institutions have committed human rights violations.” Under international law, a child is anyone under 18 and the use of individuals under 15 in conflicts is a war crime. Nearly 170 countries including Indonesia have ratified a UN treaty that obliges governments to stop military recruitment of anyone under 18 and to work toward ending the military exploitation of children by state and non-state armed groups. Aidi said last week that anyone under 18 who attacked Indonesian security forces with arms would not be spared. “The threat is the same as adults who can kill us with their guns,” he told AP. Nineteen people were killed by West Papua Liberation Army fighters in December, sparking a police and military crackdown in the remote central highlands that has displaced thousands of civilians. The Papuan fighters have never been well armed but have battled Indonesia since it took control of the mineral-rich region from the Dutch in 1962. Papuans, who had declared their independence the year before, see Indonesians as invaders who cemented control with a sham referendum at the end of the 1960s. Indonesian officials say the territory, which is ethnically and culturally distinct from the rest of the country, is rightfully Indonesia’s under international law because it was part of the Dutch East Indies empire that is the basis for Indonesia’s modern borders.

"422"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-egyptian-police-arrest-at-least-eight-people-for-alleged-ties-to-the/"|"Samy Magdy"|"Egyptian police arrested at least eight people on Tuesday, including a former lawmaker and key secular activists in the country’s 2011 uprising, for their alleged ties to the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood group, authorities said. The arrests mark the latest in a years-long crackdown by President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi’s government on Islamists, critics and dissent in general. Last week, Egypt’s former President Mohammed Morsi who hailed from the Brotherhood, collapsed and died in a Cairo courtroom during one of his trials. His death sparked criticism of el-Sissi’s government with rights activists accusing it of mistreating Morsi in jail and failing to provide adequate medication, allegations denied by authorities. Morsi, Egypt’s first freely elected president, had been imprisoned since his ouster by the military in 2013, after only one year in power and amid mass protests against his divisive rule. Tuesday’s statement from the Interior Ministry, which oversees the police, said the arrest of Zyad el-Elaimy, the former lawmaker, was part of a raid that targeted at least 19 businesses and economic entities linked to the Brotherhood, which Egypt designated a terrorist group in 2013. According to rights lawyer Gamal Eid, police arrested el-Elaimy on Tuesday morning in Cairo’s Maadi district. A vocal critic of el-Sissi’s government, el-Elaimy is a leading member of the secular Egyptian Social Democratic Party. He was a parliament member after the 2011 uprising that toppled autocrat President Hosni Mubarak. Economist Omar el-Shenety and journalists Hossam Monis and Hisham Fouad were also arrested, the ministry said. Monis was the presidential campaign manager for opposition leader Hamdeen Sabahi, the only candidate who ran against el-Sissi in the 2014 presidential election. Abdel-Aziz el-Husseini, a senior leader in the Karama, or Dignity party, said el-Elaimy and Monis took part in meetings with political parties and opposition lawmakers to discuss possibilities to run in the 2020 parliamentary elections. Their latest meeting was late Monday in Cairo, he added. “These public meetings are legitimate. They are members in legitimate parties and absolutely have no ties to the Brotherhood,” he said. The meetings included the Civil Democratic Movement, a coalition of liberal and left-leaning parties, which called for their release. Amnesty International condemned the arrests, as part of “the Egyptian authorities’ systematic persecution and brutal crackdown on anyone who dares to criticize them.” “The crackdown leaves no doubt about the authorities’ vision for political life in Egypt; an open-air prison with no opposition, critics or independent reporting allowed,” said Magdalena Mughrabi, Amnesty International’s North Africa director of research. The Interior Ministry statement said the detained were collaborating with wanted Brotherhood members in Turkey to plot violence and riots on the anniversary of the June 30 mass protests that led to the military ouster of Morsi from power. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights said the detained were questioned by prosecutors later Tuesday. Morsi, who was known to have diabetes, was often held in solitary confinement and was largely barred from receiving visitors. His family was only allowed to visit three times. While in detention, Morsi continued to appear in court on a range of charges. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a fierce el-Sissi critic, has claimed that Morsi didn’t die of natural causes but was killed. He has also said he believes the United Nations should take up “Morsi’s suspicious death.” Egyptian authorities deny mistreatment of Morsi and have dismissed Erdogan’s claims.

In February, the United States began the 6-month process of withdrawing from the landmark 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty agreed with the then Soviet Union, blaming Russia for refusing to comply with the pact. The INF treaty will end unless Russia changes its mind by August 2, and NATO ministers are weighing what steps to take in response. “Tomorrow we will decide on the next steps in the case Russia does not comply,” Stoltenberg told reporters on the eve of the meeting at NATO headquarters in Brussels. The treaty bans production, testing and deployment of land-based cruise and ballistic missiles with a range of 500-5,500 kilometres. The Pentagon has shared information with NATO allies asserting that Russia’s 9M729 missile system contravenes the treaty. It believes the ground-fired cruise missile could give Moscow the ability to launch a nuclear strike in Europe with little or no notice. Moscow insists the missile has a range of less than 500 kilometres and counters that the U.S., itself, has been breaching the INF treaty. Stoltenberg declined to elaborate on what steps NATO might take, but he did say some can be implemented “quite quickly.” Others, he said, “will take more time.” Whatever is decided, it’s unlikely the measures will be made public before August 2. NATO is trying to encourage Russia to take part in a meeting of ambassadors next week to discuss the issue, as time runs out to save the INF treaty – which is considered a cornerstone of European defence. Stoltenberg said “there are just five weeks left for Russia to save the treaty.” He said NATO’s response will be “defensive, measured and co-ordinated. We will not mirror what Russia does, we do not intend to deploy new land based nuclear missiles in Europe. We do not want a new arms race.” Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day’s most important headlines. Sign up today.

The report said the pilot, who has been identified as Tim McCormack, 58, of Clinton Corners, New York, had asked air traffic controllers for permission to return to a heliport on East 34th Street and then changed course and altitude several times. He came within 500 feet of the heliport before reversing course and striking the 54-story AXA Equitable Center on Seventh Avenue in one of the city’s busiest areas a few blocks north of Times Square. No one in the building or on the ground was injured. The NTSB said after taking off from the heliport McCormack had radioed that he did not know where he was. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said earlier this month to fly into tightly controlled airspace above midtown Manhattan the pilot would have needed approval from the air traffic control tower at LaGuardia Airport across the East River in the borough of Queens. McCormack was a commercial pilot who had flown for American Continental Properties since 2014 the company said. The weather on the day of the crash had been gray and rainy and the report said McCormack had waited in the heliport lounge for two hours continuously checking weather conditions on a tablet computer. Before he departed for the Linden, New Jersey, airport he told staff he saw “a 20-minute window to make it out,” the NTSB report said. The Agusta A109 helicopter had departed from Amenia in upstate New York earlier in the day with McCormack and one passenger and stopped for fuel in Poughkeepsie before landing in New York City. The passenger, who also was a pilot and was not aboard when the helicopter crashed, said the earlier flights had been uneventful. The twin-engine, seven-seat helicopter was manufactured in 2000 and had been inspected last month. McCormack held a commercial pilot certificate with a helicopter rating issued in 2004 and was a certified flight instructor but he was not instrument rated.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner opened a two-day international meeting in Bahrain to rally support for the blueprint, which has met broad disdain from Palestinians and others in the Arab world although regional U.S. allies such as Saudi Arabia discreetly support it. “We can turn this region from a victim of past conflicts into a model for commerce and advancement throughout the world,” Kushner told the gathering, attended by the heads of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, whose Palestinian Authority exercises limited self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, was scathing about its prospects: “Money is important. The economy is important … The political solution is more important.” The political details of the peace plan, almost two years in the making, remain secret. Neither the Israeli nor Palestinian governments attended the curtain-raising event while several Arab states stayed away or sent deputy ministers. The conference is taking place in Bahrain, home to the U.S. Navy’s Fifth Fleet, amid high tension between Tehran on the one hand and Washington and its Sunni Muslim allies Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates on the other. All share a common foe with Israel in Shi’ite Iran. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a close Trump ally, said Israel was open to the proposal. Washington will be hoping that wealthy Gulf Arab states show a concrete interest in the plan, which expects donor nations and investors to contribute $50-billion to the Palestinian territories, Jordan, Egypt and Lebanon. “To be clear, economic growth and prosperity for the Palestinian people are not possible without an enduring and fair political solution to the conflict … one that guarantees Israel’s security and respects the dignity of the Palestinian people,” Kushner said. “However, today is not about the political issues. We will get to those at the right time.” It is not clear whether the Trump team plans to abandon the “two-state solution,” which involves creation of an independent Palestinian state living side-by-side with Israel. The United Nations and most countries back the two-state solution, which has underpinned every peace plan for decades, but Trump’s team has consistently refused to commit to it. Kushner told Al Jazeera TV on Monday that the Trump plan would not follow a Saudi-led Arab initiative that has been the Arab consensus on the outline of a settlement since 2002. Any solution must settle long-standing issues such as the status of Jerusalem, mutually agreed borders, Israel’s security concerns, Palestinian demands for statehood, and the fate of Israel’s settlements and military presence in territory where Palestinians want to build that state. The Saudi-backed initiative calls for a Palestinian state with borders that predate Israel’s capture of territory in the 1967 Middle East war, as well as a capital in East Jerusalem and refugees’ right of return – all rejected by Israel. Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Kushner was “committed to the initiatives of Israel’s colonial settlement councils.” On the outskirts of Ramallah in the West Bank, Palestinian lawmaker Mustafa Barghouti said there could be “no economic solution as a substitute for our freedom.” A small crowd of protesters was dispersed by Israeli troops firing tear gas. In Gaza, businesses closed doors in a general strike called by the ruling Islamist Hamas group and other factions. An Iranian official called Kushner’s plan “shameful” and “doomed to failure.” Trump on Monday imposed sanctions on Iran’s supreme leader and other officials after Iran downed a U.S. drone following attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf. Palestinian leaders boycotted the conference, and are refusing to engage with the White House, accusing it of pro-Israel bias. Breaking with the international consensus, Trump in 2017 recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, infuriating the Palestinians and other Arabs. However, Palestinian and Israeli businessmen are attending, as are some Gulf and U.S. companies, including Blackstone Group, whose chief executive Stephen Schwarzman said Kushner’s economic plan was “not unachievable.” Emirati billionaire Mohamed Alabbar said Arabs like him were ready to invest. “This is a very sensible kind of dream and one would’ve hoped the beneficiaries would’ve been here,” he said. Haim Taib, Israeli president of British-based Mitrelli, an infrastructure development firm, said the plan seemed “doable” but it was unclear how momentum would be maintained beyond the event. More than half of the $50-billion would be spent in the Palestinian territories over 10 years. The rest would be divided between Lebanon, Egypt and Jordan, the country that has absorbed more Palestinians than any other, and fears anything that might lead to their permanent settlement there. A Palestinian businessman attending expressed disappointment that Kushner had not done more to address the political situation. “Jared is not a politician, he’s a real estate man,” the businessman said on condition of anonymity. “But you can’t make economic peace only or political peace only, you have to do them both at the same time.” Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day’s most important headlines.

The three-Michelin-starred restaurant in Menton climbed to the top from third last year, replacing Italy’s Osteria Francescana. Mirazur’s menu, which includes dishes like salt-crusted beetroot from the garden with caviar cream, is inspired by the sea, the mountains and produce from its own gardens, which cascade over three levels. Its Argentine-born chef Mauro Colagreco told Reuters he felt like he “was in the sky” after winning the award, which “showed the world when you have a dream all is possible”. He and his team accepted the prize carrying a banner that combined the flags of Argentina, France, Brazil and Italy. Launched in 2002, the 50 Best list has grown in prominence to rival the long-established Michelin star system. The ceremony in Singapore is the first to be held in Asia. After a change in the rules earlier this year, restaurants that previously topped the poll will no longer be eligible for the annual ranking. Past winners, including Osteria Francescana, joined a newly created “Best of the Best” category. René Redzepi’s re-opened Noma in Copenhagen, Denmark, debuted on the 2019 list at No. 2. In its previous incarnation, Noma won the top title in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2014. Spain dominated the top 10 list with three restaurants. Asador Etxebarri in Axpe was ranked No.3 for showing off simple ingredients by grilling them, while Mugaritz was seventh and Disfrutar came ninth. Compiled by William Reed Business Media, the Best 50 list is based on the experiences of more than 1,000 restaurant industry experts around the world. The only Asian restaurant in the top 10 was Gaggan in Bangkok, Thailand, at No. 4. Kolkata-born chef Gaggan Anand’s playful menu includes a curry dish that diners are encouraged to lick from the plate, while music by rock band Kiss plays in the background. Another Copenhagen restaurant, Geranium, was fifth on the list, while Paris’s Arpège, where vegetables take centre-stage, was No. 8. Peru, which has emerged in recent years as a top culinary destination, featured twice in the top 10 – Lima’s Central remained sixth, while Japanese-Peruvian fusion outlet Maido, with its 50-hour-cooked beef short rib, was No. 10.

"427"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-judith-krantz-whose-tales-of-sex-and-shopping-sold-millions-dies-at-2/"|"Margalit Fox"|"Judith Krantz, who almost single-handedly turned the sex-and-shopping genre of fiction into the stuff of high commerce, making her one of the world’s bestselling novelists if not one of the most critically acclaimed, died on Saturday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 91. Her publicist, John Tellem, confirmed the death. Though she did not publish her first book until she was 50, Ms. Krantz reigned for decades afterward as the queen of poolside reading. Her 10 novels – beginning with Scruples in 1978 and ending with The Jewels of Tessa Kent in 1998 – have together sold more than 85 million copies in more than 50 languages. Most became TV movies or miniseries, many of which were produced by Ms. Krantz’s husband, Steve Krantz. What drove Ms. Krantz’s books to the tops of bestseller lists was a formula that she honed to glittering perfection: fevered horizontal activities combined with fevered vertical ones – the former taking place in sumptuously appointed bedrooms and five-star hotels, the latter anywhere with a cash register and astronomical price tags. Elements of Ms. Krantz’s formula had existed piecemeal in earlier fiction for women, conspicuously in the work of Jacqueline Susann, the author of Valley of the Dolls (1966) and other steamy novels of the 1960s and 70s. But Ms. Krantz was almost certainly the first writer to combine the steam and the shopping in such opulent profusion. In a sense, Ms. Krantz was a fantasy novelist. Her heroines – invariably rich, thin, savvy, ambitious and preternaturally beautiful – are undisputed princesses, their castles the opulent hotels, condominiums, casinos and boutiques of New York, Paris, Beverly Hills and Monte Carlo. “I’ve never written about real people,” Ms. Krantz told Town & Country magazine in 1998, adding: “In a way, I write Horatio Alger stories for women.” Not surprising, Ms. Krantz’s novels took regular drubbings from reviewers. The English novelist and critic Angela Carter once likened reading them to “being sealed inside a luxury shopping mall whilst being softly pelted with scented sex technique manuals.” In the end, Ms. Krantz appeared to have the last laugh. Of all the luxury brands that loom large in her books, there is none larger or more luxurious than the Judith Krantz brand itself – a brand, impeccably built, that allowed her to lead the jet-setting, Chanel-clad life of a character in a Judith Krantz novel. Judith Bluma-Gittel Tarcher was born in Manhattan on Jan. 9, 1928. Her father, Jack, ran his own advertising agency and was later a vice-president of the Madison Avenue powerhouse Doyle Dane Bernbach. Her mother, Mary (Brager) Gittel, was a lawyer. Her younger brother, Jeremy, grew up to found the publishing house J.P. Tarcher. (She also had a sister, Mimi.) Young Judy was reared in a Central Park West apartment awash in Renoir and Degas, and attended private school. But her mother, wanting her not to take wealth for granted, dressed her in unfashionable clothes, a condition, Ms. Krantz later said, that made her deeply unpopular at school. “I didn’t have romantic fantasies; I had clothes fantasies,” she told Redbook magazine in 2000. “I thought that if I had absolutely perfect clothes, everyone would like me.” After earning a bachelor’s degree in English from Wellesley in Massachusetts, Ms. Krantz worked as a fashion publicist in Paris before returning to New York. She married Steve Krantz in 1954. He would go on to produce Fritz the Cat (1972), the first X-rated full-length animated film, and the romantic comedy Cooley High (1975). Ms. Krantz became an accessories editor at Good Housekeeping and later wrote for women’s magazines, including Cosmopolitan. For one article for Cosmo, she was assigned to compile readers’ sex fantasies. In doing so she added a few of her own, only to be told by the magazine’s editor, Helen Gurley Brown, that her fantasies were far too racy for Cosmo to print. Years later, Ms. Krantz cheerfully repurposed them for one of her novels. At her husband’s urging, Ms. Krantz turned her vivid imagination to fiction in the late 1970s. Scruples, issued by Crown Publishers, reached No. 1 on The New York Times Best Seller List in the summer of 1978. By the end of 1979, it had sold more than 220,000 copies in hardcover and more than three million in paperback. That year, Bantam Books bought the paperback rights to Princess Daisy for US$3.2-million, then a record for a softcover sale. Ms. Krantz, who moved to Southern California with her family in the early 1970s, lived for many years in an 8,000-square-foot Bel Air home that was a riot of chintz, the silver snuff boxes and 19th-century opaline glass she collected, Chanel suits – she owned at least 40 – and Hermès. Ms. Krantz leaves her sons, Tony and Nicholas. Mr. Krantz died in 2007. Her brother, Jeremy Tarcher, died in 2015. Her other novels include Mistral’s Daughter (1982), I’ll Take Manhattan (1986), Dazzle (1990) and Scruples Two (1992). If it nettled Ms. Krantz that her work was compared unfavourably with that of literary novelists, she could take heart from the fact that her books found their way to millions of readers who appreciated them for precisely what they were – a point brought home vividly after tiny errors surfaced in two of her novels. In Scruples, Ms. Krantz’s heroine wears a pair of 11-carat diamond earrings. Later in the book, the earrings were inadvertently described as nine carats each, a discrepancy about which more than 450 readers wrote her disgruntled letters. On the other hand, when Princess Daisy erroneously placed the start of the Second World War at 1940 instead of 1939, Ms. Krantz received only a single letter.

Hatice Cengiz, a Turkish citizen, told a Human Rights Council event in Geneva about her grief over Mr. Khashoggi’s Oct. 2 slaying at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul when he went there to pick up a document for their marriage. Ms. Cengiz said the possibility her fiancée might not really be dead haunts her because his body hasn’t been found, compounding her loss with “an unbelievably different kind of trauma.” She appeared at a 90-minute council “side event” organized by Canada and hosted by advocacy group No Peace Without Justice. Ms. Cengiz provided one of several testimonials on the theme “Silencing Dissent.” Most of the speakers criticized alleged rights abuses in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Diplomats from Western and regional countries such as Turkey and Qatar were in the audience. In her testimony on Mr. Khashoggi’s killing, Ms. Cengiz cited many of independent UN expert Agnes Callamard’s findings, which were released last week in a 101-page report. Ms. Callamard, a fellow “Silencing Dissent” panelist, laid out an excruciatingly detailed account of The Washington Post columnist’s alleged final moments at the consulate. She said more investigation was warranted of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s possible role in Mr. Khashoggi’s killing. Speaking through a translator, Ms. Cengiz said the report needed to be acted upon and noted the Crown Prince may one day be Saudi Arabia’s head of state. “The report points to the fact that important Saudi officials, big officials, may have been involved,” she said. “It says this should be pursued and it says that an international murder investigation should be opened.” Ms. Cengiz said the “international public” needs to exert pressure to ensure the case isn’t forgotten “and the United Nations needs to take this to the next step.” During her comments at Tuesday’s panel, Ms. Callamard, an academic and long-time human-rights advocate, took up broader themes. She decried a trend of violence against journalists and others who speak truth to power. “The targeted killings of journalists, human rights defenders, dissenters more generally, is on the increase,” she said. “The most worrying pattern is that impunity for those killings and the continuation of those killings [has] not gone down.” Saudi Arabia is among the 47 member states of the Human Rights Council, which opened its three-week summer session on Monday. Ms. Callamard was expected to present her report formally to the council on Wednesday, and the Saudi delegation is entitled to give a reply.

"429"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-spacex-launches-falcon-heavy-rocket-with-24-satellites-4/"|"Bill Tarrant"|"A SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket blasted off from Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Tuesday, putting 24 experimental satellites into orbit after what Elon Musk’s rocket company called one of its “most difficult” launches ever. The craft lifted off to cheers from onlookers at 2:30 a.m. (0630 GMT) after a three-hour delay from the original launch time late Monday. The boosters separated safely as the craft began its six-hour mission to deploy the satellites. The two side booster rockets returned safely to Earth, descending onto adjacent Air Force landing pads, but the rocket’s centre booster missed its mark, crashing in the Atlantic Ocean. Musk, who predicted trouble landing the centre booster on SpaceX’s drone ship, said on Twitter early Tuesday, “It was a long shot.” The mission, dubbed Space Test Program 2 (STP-2), is the third for the Falcon Heavy rocket, which SpaceX describes as the most powerful launch system in the world. It was commissioned by the U.S. Department of Defense, the key contractor for commercial space companies such as SpaceX. SpaceX has landed and used many of its booster rockets more than once, touting their reusability as an effective way to cut the costs of future space travel. The U.S. Space and Missile Systems Center, a unit of the U.S. Air Force, said all the satellites lifted into orbit had been deployed and made contact after what one of its officials called “a momentous launch.” It marked the first time that the Pentagon has allowed its satellites or other hardware to be launched aboard a previously used rocket. “The SpaceX Falcon Heavy allows the Air Force to begin using previously flown rocket technology to further reduce the cost of launch,“ said Colonel Dennis Bythewood, program executive officer at the Space and Missile Systems Center in Los Angeles. The company deployed the satellites for agencies including NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), defence department laboratories, universities and a non-profit organization, SpaceX said. The mission was one of the most challenging in SpaceX history, with four separate upper-stage engine burns and three separate orbits to deploy the satellites, the company said on its website. The payloads on the satellites Falcon Heavy put into orbit included an atomic clock NASA is testing for space navigation, another testing new telescope technologies, and a solar sail project part-funded by the Planetary Society, a non-profit organization headed by Bill Nye, popularly known as the “Science Guy” from his frequent U.S. TV appearances. The LightSail 2 is a crowdfunded project that aims to become the first spacecraft in Earth orbit propelled solely by sunlight, the Planetary Society, which has championed solar propulsion for decades, said on its website. LightSail 2 was enclosed within Prox-1, a small satellite built by Georgia Tech students, which will deploy it on July 2, according to the website. Falcon Heavy is the most powerful operational rocket in the world “by a factor of two,” SpaceX said on its website. It has the ability to lift nearly 64 metric tons (141,000 pounds) into orbit – more than a 737 jetliner loaded with passengers, crew, luggage and fuel.

"430"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-george-rosenkranz-a-developer-of-the-birth-control-pill-dies-at-102-2/"|"Robert D. McFadden"|"George Rosenkranz, a chemist who, with two colleagues, altered human reproductive history in a Mexico City lab in 1951 by synthesizing the key ingredient in what became the oral contraceptive known as “the pill,” died Sunday at his home in Atheron, Calif. He was 102. His grandson Adrian Rosenkranz confirmed the death. Besides a seminal contribution to birth-control science, Mr. Rosenkranz’s team achieved the first practical synthesis of cortisone, the drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and reduce painful inflammations in muscles and joints. He was also a world-class contract bridge champion whose wife was kidnapped during a tournament in Washington in 1984 and ransomed for US$1-million. A Hungarian Jew and Swiss-trained chemical engineer who fled fascism as the Second World War engulfed Europe, Mr. Rosenkranz took refuge in Cuba and after the war became the research director of Syntex, a pharmaceutical lab in Mexico. There, in a scientific backwater, he assembled a small group of chemists who laid the groundwork for revolutionary advances in steroid hormone drugs. Scientists had long known that high levels of estrogen and progesterone effectively inhibited ovulation. But synthesizing those hormones from animal or plant extracts had been too expensive and relatively ineffective for use in commercial oral contraceptives. In the early 1950s, a race was on among pharmaceutical competitors to crack the chemical code for an ovulation restraint. After long experimentation, Mr. Rosenkranz and his colleagues, the chemist Carl Djerassi, an Austrian refugee, and their student lab assistant, Luis E. Miramontes, achieved a breakthrough by synthesizing a progestin they called norethindrone. It was Oct. 15, 1951, a date later recorded for posterity on the patent all three shared, although it was hardly clear at first what they had achieved. Norethindrone, sometimes called norethisterone, proved to be an effective pregnancy inhibitor, and it was inexpensive to produce. But instead of an advance for birth control, the team regarded it as a fertility treatment, and it was initially developed for pregnant women to avert miscarriages. Five years of trials were needed to demonstrate its safety and effectiveness for the birth control pill. Even then, some drug companies were reluctant to market the pill, fearing boycotts of their products by religious groups and others opposed to birth control. In the 1960s, however, research by M.C. Chang, Gregory Pincus, John Rock and others proved its efficacy, and the pill – technically called the combined oral contraceptive – was developed and marketed by Syntex, G.D. Searle, Johnson & Johnson and other companies. The use of the pill spread rapidly, leading to vast economic and social effects. Women gained unprecedented control over fertility, separating sex from procreation. Couples were able to plan pregnancies and regulate the size of their families. Women could plan their educations and careers. But the pill also generated intense debates over promiscuity and the morality of birth control. The Roman Catholic Church, in particular, stressed its bans on artificial contraception. “I leave to others any debate about the ultimate worth of the pill,” Mr. Rosenkranz said in 2001, accepting an award from the University of Mexico on the 50th anniversary of his synthesis. “We must never forget that original research is the lifeblood of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry and that an interdisciplinary team effort is the indispensable motor of significant research achievement.” He was born Gyorgy Rosenkranz in Budapest on Aug. 20, 1916, the only child of Bertalan and Stella (Weiner) Rosenkranz. His prosperous parents filled his childhood with an appreciation of art, music, theatre and contract bridge. He had a gift for languages, eventually becoming fluent in a half-dozen. But scientific studies, particularly chemistry, held a stronger appeal. At 17, he enrolled at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, where he studied organic chemistry under the future Nobel laureate Leopold Ruzicka. In 1937, he became his mentor’s assistant and earned his doctorate in 1940. With Hitler’s armies already enveloping much of Europe, Rosenkranz and other Jewish students resolved to quit the Continent. Mr. Ruzicka arranged an academic post for him in Quito, but his trans-Atlantic journey ended in Cuba in December, 1941, when the United States’ entry into the Second World War left him stranded in Havana. He joined a Cuban laboratory, where he developed treatments for venereal diseases and studied hormone synthesis. In 1945, he married Edith Stein, a native of Austria who, like her husband, had fled the Nazis and landed in Cuba. They had three sons, Roberto, Geraldo and Ricardo. Geraldo died in 2011. Mr. Rosenkranz leaves his wife; his sons Ricardo and Roberto; and nine grandchildren. Mr. Rosenkranz’s work on hormone synthesis drew the attention of scientists abroad, and in 1945 he was recruited to join Syntex in Mexico City. He spent the rest of his working career there, and became a naturalized Mexican in 1949. Merck & Co. first produced cortisone commercially in 1948 or 1949 by a costly and complex process of chemical transformations. Mr. Rosenkranz and chemists at Harvard and Merck raced with one another to synthesize cortisone in a simpler, inexpensive process for industrial-scale production. In 1951, Mr. Rosenkranz claimed victory, publishing a paper that edged out his competitors by weeks. As oral contraceptives gained worldwide popularity, Mr. Djerassi lectured widely to promote the pill and became a wealthy celebrity. He faced controversies over its side effects, including risks of blood clots, cancer and excessive menstrual bleeding. But manufacturers cut estrogen and progestin doses to reduce risks. He wrote books, taught at universities, collected art and died in 2015. Mr. Miramontes, who earned a degree in chemical engineering from the University of Mexico, won many patents for pharmaceutical chemistry and taught at various universities. He died in 2004. Mr. Rosenkranz became chief executive and chairman of the Syntex Corp., which grew into a diversified international pharmaceutical and biotechnology company with a market capitalization of US$5-billion. He retired in 1981. He wrote hundreds of articles and scientific papers, was named in 150 patents and was honoured by scientific groups and the Mexican government. As a contract bridge player, Mr. Rosenkranz won a dozen North American championships. He created bidding systems, wrote 15 books on bridge and was inducted into the American Contract Bridge League Hall of Fame in 2000. Ms. Rosenkranz, one of Mexico’s top players, often accompanied him on tournament trips. In July, 1984, attending a tournament in Washington, Ms. Rosenkranz, 60, was abducted at gunpoint by two men outside her hotel, thrown into a van and held captive in a motel in Norfolk, Va., for two days. After her husband dropped a US$1-million ransom in Alexandria, Va., she was released, shaken but uninjured, near the White House. Three men, including a bridge player known to a regular partner of Mr. Rosenkranz in national competitions, were seized by FBI agents minutes later, and the money was recovered. Agents had been following the abductors’ van since the money had been picked up, and had pounced only after Ms. Rosenkranz’s safety was assured. “I was terrified,” she told federal court jurors in Washington, after testifying that the men had threatened to kill her unless the ransom was paid. The suspects, Glenn Wright, 42, the bridge player described as the crime’s mastermind, and Orland Tolden, 26, both of Houston, and Dennis Moss, 27, of Cocoa, Fla., were convicted of the kidnapping and sentenced to long prison terms.

"431"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-she-will-be-missed-colleagues-honour-life-of-canadian-aid-worker/"|"Stefanie Glinski"|"Dozens of people gathered on Tuesday on a crowded rooftop overlooking Kabul’s hills at sunset to honour the life of Canadian aid worker Miriam Lindsay, 41, killed in a car accident last Thursday. Ms. Lindsay, from Maple Grove, Que., had been living in Afghanistan for the past three years. She was due to fly home to Canada this week to visit her family. In 2017, she survived a bombing in Kabul that killed 90 people and left more than 450 injured. Aziz Basam, who worked for the British Department for International Development, also died on Thursday at the scene of the crash, a head-on collision. A third person, Naweed Farshad, an Afghan government employee, died in hospital on Saturday. “She’d come into the office in the mornings, wearing Afghan embroidered dresses and colourful head scarves, joking around in broken Dari or Pashto, Afghanistan’s two main languages,” her colleague Said Jawed remembered. “She was pretty much a local and loved the Afghan people, saying she appreciated the close family ties they kept.” Ms. Lindsay, who worked for the Afghan aid agency Youth Health and Development Organization (YHDO) was known as a “Kabul-pedia." “She knew better about what was going on in the city than some of us – even if we’d grown up here,” Mr. Jawed said, laughing. “She was up-to-date on any events, even the security situation and possible threats. She always shared her sources and genuinely cared for everyone’s safety.” Ms. Lindsay began her career as a humanitarian worker in Bolivia after studying agriculture. She travelled the world to Angola, Yemen and Afghanistan to help marginalized people, her sisters Kim and Iris said in an earlier interview. Her friend and co-worker Farzana Safi said that she and Ms. Lindsay connected over Afghan fashion and culture. “She always wanted to make sure to fit in and I know she was happy living here.” J.P. Lawrence, an American journalist, remembered her love for – and extensive knowledge of – traditional crafts and carpets. Ms. Lindsay’s love for the country was remembered by many on Tuesday. “I spent Thursday – her last day – with her and she was content and happy. She also told me I shouldn’t expect her to work during her break in Canada because she wanted to spend time with her family,” Jawed Hanif, deputy director with YHDO, explained. He went to the hospital on Friday morning to identify Ms Lindsay’s body. “I told the doctors I was looking for my friend,” he said through tears. Ms. Lindsay’s free spirit and fearlessness allowed her to travel to Afghanistan’s remote provinces, visiting far-flung villages. In a small Toyota, she would drive on rough roads almost as far as Pakistan’s border to the south, visiting hospitals and talking to Afghan refugees who had returned home. “When I told our team in Kandahar, a southern province, that she had passed away, I said ‘Your mother is gone,’ and they immediately knew,” Ms. Safi said. “She was always generous and gave whatever she had.” During her weekends, she enjoyed brunching at a small city farm in Kabul, playing host to dinners at her house or catching up with friends. After the rooftop memorial service in a busy part of the city, Ms Lindsay’s friends and co-workers wrote messages on helium balloons, sending them into Kabul’s evening skies.

"432"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-un-security-council-votes-to-establish-political-mission-in-haiti/"|"Edith M. Lederer"|"The U.N. Security Council approved a resolution Tuesday establishing a political mission in Haiti starting Oct. 16 that will officially replace all U.N. peacekeeping activities in the Western Hemisphere’s poorest country. The vote on the U.S.-drafted resolution was 13-0, with Haiti’s neighbour, the Dominican Republic, and China abstaining. The council’s action followed its unanimous vote April 12 to end Haitian peacekeeping operations Oct. 15. U.N. military peacekeepers left the country on Oct. 15, 2017, after 13 years. But a stabilization mission has stayed behind to train national police, help the government strengthen judicial and legal institutions, and monitor human rights. The resolution authorizes the political mission to advise Haiti’s government “in promoting and strengthening political stability and good governance,” including promoting the rule of law, supporting an inclusive national dialogue and protecting and promoting human rights. Acting U.S. Ambassador Jonathan Cohen called adoption of the resolution “a historic moment,” saying the transition from a peacekeeping to a political mission demonstrates “that as conditions on the ground evolve the U.N.’s presence can — and should — change to reflect these new realities.” A successful transition, he said, will depend in large part on the Haitian government’s assumption of responsibilities for a range of issues including professionalizing the national police, reducing community and gang violence, protecting human rights, improving prison facilities and reforming the justice system. This month, thousands of protesters denouncing corruption have been demanding the removal of Haitian President Jovenel Moise. A Senate investigation recently determined at least 14 former government officials allegedly misused $3.8 billion under the administration of former President Michel Martelly. France’s deputy U.N. ambassador, Anne Gueguen, told the council that “the political instability, the deterioration of the economic situation and the worrying state of public finances in the country, food insecurity, difficulty in accessing basic services, as well as heightened levels of violence indeed remain sources of concern.” The political mission will begin its work in difficult conditions, Gueguen said, “and unfortunately there are fears that the already volatile situation could further deteriorate in the coming months and weeks.” France, Germany, Peru, the Dominican Republic and other council members expressed regret that the resolution recognizes “the adverse effects of natural disasters on the stability of Haiti” but makes no mention of climate change. German Ambassador Christoph Hesgen said that “Haiti is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to the effects of climate change.” U.S. President Donald Trump has rejected scientific warnings on climate change. Officials in his administration argue that climate science is imperfect and say it is not clear that climate change will have as great an impact as forecast. China said it abstained in the resolution vote because the U.S. didn’t include its proposed amendments. The Dominican Republic’s ambassador, Jose Singer, said he abstained because the resolution’s wording isn’t robust enough to promote development and peace in Haiti and tackle root causes and inequalities. “This should be a mission that can really bring peace and lasting stability to Haiti,” Singer said. But “this has been reduced to a mission with limited resources and functions.” Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day’s most important headlines.

"433"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-the-palestinian-economy-is-in-tatters-but-gazans-arent-embracing/"|"Mark MacKinnon"|"The warehouse of the Sharaf metal products factory could serve as a museum to the collapse of the Gaza Strip. Hundreds of unsold gas canisters, brass valves and fire extinguishers sit covered in a thick layer of dust. They provide a reminder of the time – almost 15 years ago now – when Gaza produced industrial goods for sale in Israel and beyond. A leaning cement wall, the result of an Israeli air strike that demolished much of the building five years ago, and the bullet holes that let in shafts of light are evidence of the violence that has helped push Gaza and its roughly two million inhabitants into an abyss. In its heyday, the family-owned Sharaf factory employed 70 people, paying them between US$110 and US$330 a month, with many of those salaries supporting entire families. But the size of their work force fell as a series of shocks convulsed Gaza: the rise of the Islamist militant group Hamas, a crippling 12-year-old blockade that Israel and Egypt imposed in response and three brief but brutal wars between Hamas and Israel. More recently there’s been U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to slash aid to UNRWA, the United Nations agency responsible for the welfare of Palestinian refugees around the Middle East, as well as a dispute between Israel and the Palestinian Authority over tax transfers that has seen the salaries – and buying power – of many Palestinian civil servants slashed. In the wake of all this, UNRWA says it now delivers food aid to more than a million people in Gaza, up from 80,000 at the turn of the century. Gaza’s desperation – and the promise of better lives if the Palestinians agree to a peace deal that’s expected to be largely on Israel’s terms – is the heart of a Middle East peace plan the Trump administration is rolling out this week. The effort begins in earnest this week with a meeting of regional business leaders convened by Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, in the Persian Gulf kingdom of Bahrain. So far, only the economic side of the bargain is known. On the weekend, the White House unveiled a vision that would see US$50-billion injected into the economies of the West Bank and Gaza, as well as the neighbouring Arab states that have been playing host to Palestinian refugees since the 1948 and 1967 Arab-Israeli wars. Mr. Kushner is hoping wealthier Arab states such as Saudi Arabia will contribute most of the money to the international investment fund. Much of the proposal is directed at improving life in Gaza. The Sharafs, father Yousif and son Hani, now sit almost alone in their vast, silent warehouse. They have one other employee, but wonder aloud how long they’ll be able to keep paying his salary. “All of this is lost money,” 70-year-old Yousif says, waving his hand at the rows of dust-covered inventory, which he estimates might once have been worth US$6-million. “Now I have nothing. Really, I need to sell something before I can eat.” Despite their business disintegrating, the Sharaf family still have their factory and occasionally sell things to other Gazans, meaning they remain among the more affluent residents of this desolate place. Most are far worse off. With Israel limiting the import and export of dozens of categories of goods – and making it extremely difficult for people to enter or leave Gaza – the unemployment rate here has soared past 50 per cent. Among young people, many of whom have never set foot outside this 365-square-kilometre stretch of land, the jobless rate is more than 70 per cent. And a 2017 UN report predicted Gaza would become “unlivable” by 2020. That’s just six months away. Among the lures the White House is dangling in front of the Palestinians is US$5-billion to construct a transportation corridor that would connect Gaza to other Palestinian communities in the West Bank. The White House plan also hints at easing Gaza’s isolation by building a trading hub next to it in Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula. The Globe and Mail spoke to more than two dozen residents of the Gaza Strip – frustrated high-school students, desperate food-aid recipients, fishermen blocked from accessing the sea by the Israeli navy and a top Hamas official – and all agreed there was a desperate need for economic development in the strip. But none saw peace emerging if the promised aid was connected to Palestinians having to compromise on their dream of a having an independent state. “This is our land, our homeland, and Trump is trying to buy it,” said Soma Shaheen, a 36-year-old mother of five who has been forced to slash prices in half at the henna stall she runs in the Gaza Strip’s lone shopping mall. Still, she said, the promise of money, on its own, couldn’t bring peace to the region. Asked if promises of economic development could convince Palestinians to accept Israel’s control of Jerusalem, Ms. Shaheen had a simple response: “We do not agree.” The political side of the White House plan likely won’t be revealed until after Israeli elections scheduled for Sept. 17. But Mr. Kushner has already suggested the founding principle of previous talks – a two-state solution, one for Israel, one for the Palestinians – won’t be a starting point this time around. The old land-for-peace principle has been abandoned in favour of something that could be described as aid-for-peace. That shift, combined with Mr. Trump’s decision last year to move the U.S. embassy to Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem (a city the Palestinians still hope to share as the capital of their future state), has convinced the Palestinian leadership to boycott both the Bahrain conference and Mr. Trump’s Middle East initiative. The Palestinian business community – some of whom received separate invitations from the U.S. government – is also staying largely away. Some low-level political figures are attending the Bahrain workshop, such as finance department officials from several governments, including the Persian Gulf states, although none who formally represent either the Israeli government or the Palestinian Authority. “We must begin with the political problem, and after that we can talk about the economy,” said Abed Alkarim Ashour, a Gaza business consultant who rejected a written invitation from U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to attend the Bahrain meeting. “Not the economy first, as a gift for forgetting about the political problem.”     Previous peace efforts, most famously the Oslo process that earned the Nobel Peace Prize for Yasser Arafat, Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin in 1994, were both impossibly complicated and yet straightforward compared with today’s situation. Those peace talks failed over snags such as who would control which parts of Jerusalem. But the outlines of an eventual deal seemed to have been established: there would be two states for two peoples, with borders approximating those that had existed before the 1967 war. Then came Israel’s abrupt 2005 decision to pull its military out of the Gaza Strip, along with the Jewish settlements that had been built there. Hamas’s subsequent takeover of Gaza left the Oslo parameters looking obsolete. If ending direct Israeli rule of Gaza led to the rise of a group dedicated to destroying the Jewish state, why – or so the reasoning in Israel has gone ever since – should any more concessions be made to the Palestinians? Hamas’s control of Gaza has its roots in the 2006 Palestinian election, which saw Hamas stun the world by winning a majority of the seats up for grabs (though not a majority of the popular vote). Under pressure from Western governments, including Canada’s, Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas refused to cede key powers to Hamas, provoking a burst of violent internecine fighting that left Mr. Abbas’s secular Fatah movement in control of the West Bank and Hamas dominant in Gaza. Israel – seeing the entire strip as now under the control of “terrorists” – launched its blockade, and Gaza’s slide began to accelerate. Where more than 500,000 Gazans had once crossed into Israel in average month, many of them day labourers who earned salaries in Israel that were better than they could earn Gaza, last year’s monthly average was less than 9,000, according to figures provided by the Gisha Legal Centre for Freedom of Movement, an Israeli human-rights organization. The blockade also crushed exports. Gisha says the number of truckloads allowed to exit Gaza via Israel fell from more than 1,000 a month in early 2007, just before the Hamas takeover, to a monthly average of 217 last year. Meanwhile, the flow of imports – including humanitarian supplies such as fuel, gas and construction materials – has fallen by a quarter, even as the population’s needs have multiplied. Gaza’s fishermen, who form one of the few industries in the Gaza Strip that’s still semi-functional, have become used to a routine that sees the zone in which they’re allowed to fish fluctuate almost weekly. Israel prohibited all fishing last week, leaving the Gaza fleet bobbing in harbour while the Israeli navy patrolled off the coast. When a 10-mile fishing zone reopened two days later, it was the 16th change to Gaza’s fishing rules dictated by Israel since the start of the year and the ninth in less than a month. Israeli military spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Jonathan Conricus acknowledged the situation in Gaza was “appalling and sad.” But, he said, the core problem was Hamas’s presence and its focus on building up its military capabilities for the next round of hostilities – a fight both Israel and Hamas view as inevitable. “Our very delicate balance is to try to avoid a disaster, a humanitarian disaster, in Gaza, while not allowing, or minimizing, Hamas’s ability to enhance its military capabilities,” Lt.-Col. Conricus said in an interview in Tel Aviv. “The most dominant fault and responsibility lies with Hamas. They’ve been ruling Gaza now for the better part of 12 years and have nothing to show for it.”     Sitting in his office on the top floor of a building – once a business centre – that’s guarded by bearded men with black uniforms and Kalashnikov assault rifles, Hamas official Bassem Naim acknowledges Gazans have suffered in the 12 years since the organization seized power here. But, he insists, it’s not fair to blame the Islamists. “We admit that we have bad economic conditions here,” he said. “But this question [of why conditions have deteriorated during Hamas rule] must not be directed to us. It must be directed to the occupier.” Mr. Naim, a former health minister who now heads Hamas’s de facto foreign ministry, is angrily dismissive of Mr. Trump’s economically focused peace plan. “The goal of this meeting is not the economy,” he said of the Bahrain gathering. “The goal of this meeting is how to integrate Israel into the region without ending the occupation.” He waves off the possibility that Gazans – some of whom are on the brink of starvation – might be more interested in the billions of dollars in aid and investment than they are in the fate of Jerusalem, a city many Gazans have never visited. But business people and civil-society activists in Gaza say Hamas is very much part of their problem. Mr. Sharaf’s factory was briefly closed in 2013 because Hamas officials decided gas canisters produced there looked too much like those being sold in Israel. Basil Eleiwa, an entrepreneur who runs Gaza’s poshest new restaurant, Level Up, says his business has been hampered by Hamas bureaucrats who dislike a public place where men and women can sit at the same table and smoke hookah pipes. He said Level Up must seek a special permit whenever someone wants to hold so much as a birthday party there. (One of Mr. Eleiwa’s previous businesses, a hotel, was burned down by Islamic extremists in 2000 because guests could consume alcohol on the premises.) The fighting between Fatah and Hamas, Mr. Eleiwa said, has damaged the Palestinian cause as much as any outside factor. “Even Israel used to respect the fact that we have rights. Now we’ve lost the respect of even other Arabs, because of what we’ve done to ourselves.”     Pierre Krahenbuhl, the commissioner-general of UNRWA, says it should be “an international scandal” that so many Palestinians living in Gaza are now reliant on food aid. Of the million people who rely on UNRWA, 620,000 are now living in what he called “abject” poverty, meaning their entire family is living on nothing but the assistance UNRWA provides. “This isn’t a natural disaster. This is completely man-made,” he said in an interview at UNRWA headquarters in Jerusalem. But the scandal in the eyes of some is the very existence of UNRWA and the fact it has provided aid to generations of Palestinian refugees who claim they have a right to return home to what is now Israel. Last year, the Trump administration cut off the US$300-million in annual aid the United States provided to the organization – the State Department said UNRWA was “irredeemably flawed” – creating a funding crisis just as demands on UNRWA were multiplying. (Canada also cut its funding to UNRWA under Stephen Harper’s Conservative government; in 2016, the Liberals restored Canada’s support to its previous level of $25-million annually.) UNRWA has drummed up enough emergency support from donor countries to meet the swelling demand for its aid packages that contain flour, rice, chickpeas, milk and other essentials. But the budget hole left by the U.S. aid cut, combined with Gaza’s growing food needs, forced UNRWA to cut other services – such as social and psychological counselling – in order to focus on primary needs. “Our health staff describe the deterioration of psycho-social conditions as being of epic proportions in Gaza. … There’s so little capability to absorb further shocks that any little thing that happens – a dispute with a neighbour – escalates very, very quickly,” Mr. Krahenbuhl said, adding that domestic violence was also rising at an alarming rate. “Nothing I see in Gaza is reconcilable with anybody’s security concerns.” Also under threat is UNRWA’s ability to maintain the 252 schools it operates in Gaza that provide 280,000 students with a free education based on the Palestinian national curriculum, rather than Hamas’s version. Jeneen al-Huweihi, a 15-year-old whose peers elected her to UNRWA’s student parliament, said Gaza’s economic tensions were evident in her classroom, where even things such as pencils and stationary had become scarce. “With the current crisis that Gaza is going through, that UNRWA is going through, the problem we see most is bullying and higher levels of theft,” she said, her voice cracking with emotion. “Kids steal backpacks, and even small things like a notebook, so that they have the resources they need to get educated.” Jeneen said her dream was to one day serve as the Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, so she could change the way the world saw Gaza and Gazans. Amjad Shawa, the director of the Palestinian NGOs Network, an umbrella group for Gaza’s civil-society organizations, said hopelessness is rampant among Gaza’s youth, who see no route to a better life so long as Israel maintains its siege. But, he said, the scale of what Palestinians have endured was exactly why they couldn’t accept the kind of lopsided aid-for-peace deal Mr. Trump and Mr. Kushner are seeking. “Too many people were killed, too many people died,” Mr. Shawa said, fighting back tears as he spoke. “And they didn’t die for this.”  Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day’s most important headlines.

"434"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-us-iran-tension-looms-over-g20-summit-in-japan/"|"Michael Martina"|"Concerns over trade, conflict and oil will dominate a summit of the Group of 20 major economies in Japan this weekend, with attention focused on a meeting between the leaders of the United States and China, embroiled in a lengthy trade war. Donald Trump and Xi Jinping will meet for the first time in seven months to discuss deteriorating ties between the world’s two largest economies. But prospects of progress look slim, as neither side has given ground after talks broke down in May. Many G20 members have a stake in the outcome because the row has disrupted global supply chains, slowed world growth and stirred expectations of interest rate cuts or other stimulus measures by some of the group’s central banks. But some have expressed disquiet that the trade row might overshadow efforts to tackle pressing international issues. The Sino-U.S. trade clash is “serious”, but it shouldn’t “take a multilateral body hostage”, said an official of French President Emmanuel Macron’s Elysee office. Trump will arrive in Osaka just a week after calling off a retaliatory air strike on Iran after it shot down an unmanned U.S. aircraft. The threat of a Middle East conflict has driven up global oil prices. The leaders of Russia and Saudi Arabia, both G20 members, will also attend the two-day summit that starts on Friday, ahead of a meeting of oil cartel OPEC on July 1 and 2 to discuss oil supply policy. Financial markets have rallied since Trump and Xi spoke by telephone last week and agreed to meet in Osaka and revive trade talks that collapsed in early May, after the United States accused China of reneging on its pledges. The two sides have slapped tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other’s imports in the nearly year-long trade war, even as they have tried to hammer out a broad trade deal. Trump views his meeting with Xi, probably to be held on Saturday, as a chance to see where Beijing stands and is “comfortable with any outcome”, a senior U.S. official said, on condition of anonymity. White House officials have declined to discuss expectations ahead of the summit, saying only they are hopeful for Chinese leaders to follow through on commitments to compete fairly. Beijing counters that U.S. demands for a host of economic reforms amount to a violation of its sovereignty. Publicly, Chinese officials say the trade war’s effects are controllable and they are in no hurry to reach a deal. Many in Beijing hope the 2020 U.S. election campaign could deter Trump from further trade measures that risk upsetting farmers and businesses. “Right now we feel, actually, that we have more stamina than the U.S. side,” said Liang Ming, a trade expert at the Chinese commerce ministry’s Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation. Xi is unlikely to delve into the details of a potential trade deal, as he did at a meeting with Trump in Buenos Aires in December, said a source who recently met Chinese trade officials. Instead, Xi will try to “set a new trajectory” for ties, the source quoted the trade officials as saying. Privately, Chinese trade experts acknowledge disagreement in policy circles about confronting Washington on trade, with many wary of further U.S. tariffs. American sanctions on China’s telecoms giant Huawei Technologies could also figure in the leaders’ talks. A truce in the trade spat is more likely than a deal, said Matthew Goodman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, formerly an international economic adviser to former president Barack Obama. Several other G20 members, such as India, Japan, Mexico and European Union nations, also have had to grapple with the Trump administration’s efforts to remake trade ties. That’s making it difficult to craft a final communique with language that all 20 members can agree on, Japanese government officials say. A draft of the statement calls for “the promotion of free trade” as a means to achieve strong global growth, Japan’s Asahi newspaper reported Wednesday. At last year’s summit, under pressure from the Trump administration, the G20 removed a phrase calling for the need to resist protectionism. Some European countries are demanding that this year’s communique include language warning against the spread of protectionist policies, prompting host Japan to try to find a compromise, the Asahi said. A White House official said Trump would also meet at least eight world leaders, including Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin, to win support for sanctions on Iran. Japanese host Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wants the G20 summit to focus on reforming the World Trade Organization, empowering female workers and reducing trash in the ocean. “There’s not many topics all participants can agree on,” another Japanese government official said. “Maybe plastic garbage reduction is the only area no one opposes.” "|"Trump-Xi meeting, Iran tension to overshadow G20 summit in Japan"|"2019-06-26T01:21:00-0400"|"International,G20 summit,China,US,trade war,tariffs,sanctions,trade,trump,summit,meeting,japan,china,oil,group",

Olsen"|"Three left-wing parties in Denmark are backing the centre-left Social Democrats to form a one-party minority government. The deal would make the Social Democrats’ leader, 41-year-old Mette Frederiksen, the country’s youngest prime minister after the left-leaning party won the June 5 election. The Social Democrats won by embracing restrictive immigration policies, a pragmatic tactic that involved returning to the party’s anti-migrant roots after two decades of relatively more liberal policies. Denmark’s largest party had been in the opposition for the past four years. Despite differences over welfare and immigration, the left-leaning parties want to back Frederiksen, who is expected to form a government in the next few days. Minority Cabinets are common in Denmark. Frederiksen admitted it would be a “tough and difficult task.” “These are four very different parties, and no doubt parties with major disagreements on several political issues,” she said late Tuesday after 21 days of talks with the Social People’s Party, the Red Green Unity List and the centrist Social Liberals. Frederiksen said the deal identified several goals, including promoting integration in Denmark and reversing the previous government’s decision not to accept any refugees under a UN quota system. The UN refugee agency has made deals with countries, including Denmark, to take in refugees. Since 1989, Denmark has accepted about 500 such refugees every year. The government also wants to fight plastic pollution and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 70 per cent ahead of 2030, a goal praised by Greenpeace. The four Danish parties also agreed to drop plans to put rejected asylum-seekers and foreigners convicted of crimes on a tiny island that formerly housed facilities for researching contagious animal diseases. They also would reverse some austerity measures in health care and education. Inger Stoejberg, the outgoing immigration minister known for being a hardliner, criticized the Social Democrats for striking a deal that compromised their self-declared tough immigration stance. They had promised “a strict immigration policy” but “one can’t trust” them, she said. The June 5 elections for Denmark’s 179-seat Folketing, or Parliament, dealt a blow to the populist, anti-immigration Danish People’s Party, which had been supporting Denmark’s centre-right prime minister, who resigned. Former Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen failed to keep a majority in parliament after his allies saw their vote share plunge to 8.7 per cent in the June election from 21.1 per cent in 2015.

"436"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-spains-pedro-sanchez-to-go-ahead-with-pm-confirmation-vote-risking/"|"Belén Carreño Ingrid Melander"|"Spain’s acting Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez will next Tuesday set a date for a parliamentary vote on whether he can stay on in the role, a Socialist party source said, triggering a two-month countdown that could potentially lead to a new election. Sanchez’s Socialists won a national election in April without securing a majority of seats in a fragmented assembly, meaning they need to secure the support of other parties to govern. While government sources say they are confident Sanchez will be confirmed as prime minister, talks with potential partners have stalled. The Socialists insist there is no alternative and say they will seek parliament’s backing even if they have not secured the necessary support beforehand. “Spain has no time to waste and needs a government as soon as possible,” the Socialist Party source said. “Our country needs to move forward and Pedro Sanchez wants to lead that project with responsibility.” Sources in both the Socialist party and far-left Podemos, seen as the closest possible ally to Sanchez, said late on Tuesday that discussions were stuck. Podemos wants to be part of a coalition government but Sanchez is only willing to agree to a “co-operation” pact with lower ranking positions in the administration. Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias said on Wednesday he was confident that Sanchez would eventually agree to the coalition government Podemos wants. “The only way things can change in this country is via a coalition government,” Iglesias said, adding that he believed that Sanchez’s Plan A was too secure the support of centre-right party Ciudadanos. “The second possibility is a coalition government with us. And I want to reassure you on that. Such a coalition deal is closer than one may think.” Iglesias gave no details but pointed to the fact that he did not believe that Ciudadanos, which has repeatedly ruled out backing Sanchez, would help him stay on as prime minister. Once parliament votes on whether to confirm Sanchez as prime minister, that triggers a two-month deadline during which he can seek the assembly’s backing. If this fails, there will be repeat elections. If he does get confirmed as prime minister, the fragmentation of parliament and the challenges in finding partners raise questions on how much he could achieve, starting with a tricky vote on the country’s budget. “I’m afraid that the parties have entered into a game of chicken that could cause significant damage,” said Pablo Simon, a political-science professor at Madrid’s Carlos III university. “They should think about the risk of a repeat election, because we saw in 2016 that improving governability with a repeat vote is complicated, the outcome could be quite similar and would force them to negotiate anyway.” All this happens, at a time when Sanchez, thanks to his victories in the national, local and European elections, has succeeded in getting Spain at the negotiating table for EU top jobs.

The meeting will take place amid growing tension over Tehran. Trump threatened retaliatory attacks on Iran after blaming it for attacks on two oil tankers, while Iran has also shot down a U.S. surveillance drone. Tehran has denied responsibility for the tanker attacks and has said the U.S. drone was flying in Iranian airspace. Arm control treaties, which both Putin and Trump threatened to quit, will also be discussed by the two, according to the Kremlin fact sheet prepared for the meeting. The Kremlin aide, Yuri Ushakov, said the leaders will also likely discuss “issues of strategic stability, numerous regional conflicts,” including Syria, Venezuela and Iran. Washington has not confirmed so far the date for the meeting. “It’s not a formal summit, but it is expected to be a conversation that will focus primarily on regional security issues, including Iran, Ukraine, Syria, the Middle East,” a U.S. senior administration official said. “They should also touch on arms control issues and on improving the bilateral relationship.” Trump said last week he planned to meet Putin at the G20 summit in Japan. The two met briefly on the sidelines of major international events last December and November, after their summit in Helsinki last July when Trump refused to blame the Russian leader for meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, leading to an outcry in the United States. Putin denies the allegations of Russian meddling. Ushakov also said Putin planned to speak publicly a number of times during the G20 and would address “existing imbalances in the international financial system … (and) issues related to escalation of trade conflicts.” “(Putin) Will share his views regarding the strengthening of the role of the World Trade Organization as a universal platform for resolving various disputes and for dialogue on global trade and economic issues,” Ushakov said. China and the United States, the world’s two largest economies, are waging a costly trade war that has pressured financial markets and damaged the world economy. Markets are focused on whether Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping can narrow their differences when they sit down at the G20.

At a brief news conference, Sheriff Gregory Tony said deputies Edward Eason and Josh Stambaugh were fired Tuesday for their inaction following the Feb. 14, 2018, shooting. “In essence, it was neglect of duty. We lost 17 people,” Tony said. A state investigative commission found that Stambaugh was working an off-duty shift at a nearby school when he responded to reports of shots fired at the school. He got out of his truck, put on his bulletproof vest and took cover for about five minutes after hearing the shots, according to body camera footage. He then drove to a nearby highway instead of going toward the school. Eason ran the other way as gunfire continued, then spent time putting on his bulletproof vest and body camera while the carnage continued, investigators said. Eason was also faulted for not writing an official report after receiving a tip in February 2016 that the shooting suspect, Nikolas Cruz, was making threats on social media to shoot up a school. Tips to the FBI about Cruz also were not followed up, a separate investigation has found. Two other deputies were fired earlier this month for neglect of duty. One of those was school resource officer Scot Peterson, who was also arrested on charges of child neglect, culpable negligence and perjury. Peterson’s lawyer has said he will fight the charges. The sheriff said no action was taken on three other deputies who were involved in the investigation. Scott Israel, the sheriff at the time, was removed from office by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for similar reasons. He is appealing that decision before the state Senate. Cruz, 20, faces the death penalty if convicted in the shootings. His lawyers have said he will plead guilty in return for a life prison sentence but prosecutors have rejected that offer.

The militia attacked the police headquarters, ruling party headquarters and president’s office – where they executed three top officials – in Amhara’s regional capital of Bahir Dar on Saturday, Asemahagh Aseres told Reuters on the sidelines of a state burial for the officials who were killed. The militia was a recently formed unit of the region’s security services. It had appealed for others to join its takeover were rebuffed, Asemahagh said. “They are part of our police. They are not independent,” he told Reuters. “(But) most of the forces were not with them. They defended (us) very well.” The fact that the militia were state forces rather than independent raises the stakes for the government of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who has rolled out a package of economic and political reforms since taking office in April last year. He has lifted a ban on political parties, released journalists, rebels and prisoners, and prosecuted officials accused of abuses. But his shakeup of the military and intelligence services has earned him powerful enemies. His government is also struggling to contain discontent from Ethiopia’s myriad ethnic groups fighting the federal government and each other for greater influence and resources. Outbreaks of ethnic violence have displaced around 2.4 million people, according to the United Nations. The spokesman said the militia had detained him when it took over a guest house for government officials and also tried and failed to take over the region’s state media. He said the militia were then chased out of the city. A journalist confirmed to Reuters that militia members had approached, but withdrawn without firing at the media building’s armed security. Regional state-run media has reported 13 deaths in the violence so far. Reuters could not independently verify Asemahagh’s death toll, but two independent witnesses Reuters interviewed in a coffee house the night before confirmed the militia attacked the three targets he named. Details of more deaths in a separate but possibly linked attack in a neighbouring state also emerged on Wednesday. Men in camouflage uniforms killed more than 50 people and injured 23 others in the Metakal zone of the Benishangul-Gumuz region early on Monday, the region’s peace and security bureau head Abera Bayeta told Reuters. “We are still investigating but we have our suspicion that those attackers might be the same people who were involved in the coup in Amhara region,” he said. Reuters was unable to independently verify his account. The government has accused Amhara’s former security chief of masterminding the twin attacks that killed the region’s president Ambachew Mekonnen and two other officials in Bahir Dar, and the chief of staff and another general 325 kilometres (200 miles) away in the national capital Addis Ababa the same night. Alleged coup mastermind Asamnew Tsige, who was shot dead by security forces on Monday, was accused of trying to seize control of Amhara, not the whole country. But that was still a strike at the heart of Ethiopia’s political system – a federation stitched from a patchwork of ethnic groups and traditions. Thousands lined the streets in Ethiopia’s two main northern cities on Wednesday in mourning. But within the crowds, many said they were not happy with the government. In Bahir Dar, capital of Amhara, priests from Ethiopia’s Orthodox church gave sermons calling for forgiveness as the bodies of officials were laid out at the presidential house. Three flower-covered black hearses carrying the state president, his adviser and the state’s attorney general wound their way through the streets accompanied by traditional flute music before being buried with military salutes. Snipers stood on roofs and federal and regional security services mixed with the crowds in a show of strength. The prime minister’s wife, deputy and foreign minister, all of whom are from Amhara, attended the ceremony. “I call for law and order to be restored,” Deputy Prime Minister Demeke Mekonnen told the crowd. “We should all reserve our emotions and respect the law.” The night before the funerals in Bahir Dar, several young men told Reuters they supported Asamnew, whom they described as a defender of the Amhara people. They asked not to be named to avoid attention from the security forces. “He (Asamnew) was creating a militia because the region was under attack. It was to protect us. People from Amhara are being killed everywhere,” one said. In the neighbouring region of Tigray, thousands gathered in the capital Mekelle. Tigray was the home of the national army’s chief of staff, Seare Mekonnen, who was shot dead in Addis Ababa alongside another general from the region by his bodyguard late on Saturday. “We will not be divided by ethnicities. We will be united,” said General Asrat Denero, the chief of the Ethiopian military’s western command centre. But signs of the divisions were apparent away from the main ceremonies. Many in Tigray, whose citizens dominated the previous administration, have been angered by their loss of influence. Some accused the government of being lax on security. Others in the crowd chanted “Abiy is a traitor” and “Abiy resign”.

"440"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-palestinians-criticize-us-peace-plan-as-kushner-keeps-silent-on/"|"Matt Spetalnick"|"Palestinians on Wednesday poured scorn on the Trump administration’s $50-billion investment plan to help achieve Middle East peace, but U.S. Gulf Arab allies said the economic initiative had promise if a political settlement is reached. President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, the plan’s main architect, sought to build support for his ambitious economic proposals for the Palestinian territories at an international meeting in Bahrain. Neither the Israeli nor Palestinian governments attended the two-day gathering that took place amid a years-long stalemate in other international efforts to resolve a conflict that has lasted more than seven decades. Kushner’s plan calls for scores of business and infrastructure projects that he says are aimed at boosting the West Bank and Gaza economies and showing the Palestinians a prosperous future if they return to the negotiating table. But with the Palestinian leadership saying Kushner’s economic framework ignores their aspirations for statehood, senior Palestine Liberation Organisation official Hanan Ashrawi said the Manama conference was “quite disingenuous”. “It is totally divorced from reality. The elephant in the room is the (Israeli) occupation itself,” she told a news conference in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank. The Palestinians and many Arabs in the region have dismissed Kushner’s plan for a trade and investment boost as pointless without a political deal. Arab states, including Saudi Arabia, say any deal must be based on a two-state solution, which has underpinned every peace plan for decades. Kushner said the conference proved that the economic issues of the conflict were “solvable” but he offered no details on the yet-to-released political part of his peace drive being crafted largely in secrecy. “The reason why we thought it was important to bring out the economic vision before the political vision is because we need people to see what the future can look like,” said Kushner, who has conceded that its success hinges on reaching a long-elusive peace agreement. “We’re going to put out our political plan at the right time and we’ll see what happens,” he told reporters as the event wound up on Wednesday. Kushner, Trump’s senior White House adviser, said that in negotiations both sides have to decide when they get to “yes,” adding: “Maybe they will never get to yes.” Several thousand Palestinians demonstrated in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip and burned posters of Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “No to the conference of treason, no to the conference of shame” read one banner. The chief of the Islamist Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, criticized the plan as a ruse against the Palestinian people. “This money must not come at the expense of our enduring rights, or at the expense of Jerusalem or the right of return or at the expense of sovereignty and resistance,” he said. Several Arab states, including Lebanon, stayed away from the event while others including Jordan and Egypt, the two Arab nations that have reached peace agreements with Israel, sent deputy ministers. Washington hopes wealthy Gulf states will bankroll the plan, which expects donor nations and investors to contribute $50-billion to Palestinian and neighbouring Arab state economies. It is the first phase of broader peace plan more than two years in the making. Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which share a common foe with Israel in Shi’ite Iran, voiced qualified support for Kushner’s economic formula but made clear that the plan needed to be combined with a political solution. Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan said Riyadh would support whatever brings prosperity to the region but that it was important that it be driven by the private sector. “We should give this initiative a chance,” said UAE Minister of State for Financial Affairs Obaid Humaid al-Tayer. Bahraini Foreign Minister Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmed al-Khalifa told Israeli public broadcaster Kan the plan was an “opportunity not to be missed” and could be “very important game-changer”. Saudi Arabia said on the eve of the conference that any peace deal should be based on a Saudi-led Arab initiative that calls for a Palestinian state drawn along borders which predate Israel’s capture of territory in the 1967 Middle East war. It envisages a capital in East Jerusalem and refugees’ right of return – points rejected by Israel. Kushner has said the plan would not adhere to the Arab initiative. It is not clear whether the Trump team plans to abandon the two-state solution, which is backed by the United Nations and most countries. Trump’s team has consistently refused to commit to it. Any solution must settle long-standing issues such as the status of Jerusalem, mutually agreed borders, Israel’s security concerns, Palestinian demands for statehood, and the fate of Israel’s settlements and military presence in territory where Palestinians want to build that state. Palestinian leaders are refusing to engage with the White House, accusing it of pro-Israel bias. Breaking with the international consensus, Trump in 2017 recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, infuriating the Palestinians and other Arabs. The IMF puts unemployment at 30 per cent in the West Bank and 50 per cent in Gaza, which has suffered years of Israeli and Egyptian blockades and recent foreign aid cuts and sanctions by the Palestinian Authority, Hamas’ rival in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. “Gaza right now is feeling a lot of pain because of bad leadership and the sanctions that have been imposed on them because of it,” Kushner said. “So the question that (Hamas) leadership has to ask themselves is … do they hate their neighbour in Israel more than they love their citizens and their people?” Palestinian businessman Ashraf Jabari, chairman of the Palestinian Business Network, told the gathering it was difficult to build an economy with a “siege and unstable situation”. “Frankly, we demand an independent Palestinian state on the territories occupied by Israel in 1967,” said the businessman from Hebron, who has co-founded a trade group to boost business between Palestinians and Israeli settlers.

An official Saudi Arabian investigation into his killing by Saudi agents has failed to examine who may have ordered the killing and ignored key suspects, said Agnes Callamard, UN investigator on extrajudicial executions. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, a key adviser, and other senior officials should be investigated over the premeditated murder at its consulate in Istanbul given the evidence against them, Callamard. Saudi officials have long denied suspicions in the CIA and some Western countries that the crown prince, the kingdom’s de facto ruler, ordered the killing in October. Callamard was asked by reporters what delegations attending the G20 should raise in bilateral meetings with the Saudi delegation – headed by the crown prince. “I have insisted that the killing of Mr. Khashoggi is a state killing. It is not a killing by rogue officials as the government continued to pretend,” she said. “It is therefore important that the countries that will be present in the G20 insist that the state of Saudi Arabia do take its full responsibility for the killing”,” she said. In her report this month she urged states to widen sanctions to include the crown prince and his assets abroad, unless he can prove he is not responsible. Callamard undertook her own inquiry due to what she called “paralysis” of the United Nations. She voiced disappointment at a spokesman for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres saying that he had no power or authority to launch an international criminal investigation unless initiated by states. “I certainly call on member states to proceed with that official demarche so the Secretary-General will not be able to just create more firewalls between him and his responsibilities to take action against impunity,” she said on Wednesday. Her investigation had found “credible evidence warranting further investigation of “high-level Saudi officials’ individual liability, including that of the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia and his key adviser (Saud) Qahtani,” she told the UN Human Rights Council. “The investigation carried out by the Saudi authorities has failed to address the chain of command,” she said. Abdulaziz Alwasil, Saudi ambassador to the UN in Geneva, said Callamard’s report was “based on prejudice and prefabricated ideas”. “This is why we reject any attempt to remove this from our national justice system in Saudi Arabia, irrespective of the form that may take,” Alwasil told the council. Qahtani, seen as the right-hand man to Prince Mohammed, was removed as a royal court adviser and is the highest-profile figure implicated in the incident. However, he is not among 11 on trial. “The prosecutor in a public statement has recognised that one particular person, Saud al-Qahtani, incited the mission before it departed, calling Mr Khashoggi ‘a national threat’, and yet this particular individual has not been indicted,” Callamard said, noting that a total of 15 Saudis were involved. Hatice Cengiz, a Turkish writer and Khashoggi’s fiancée, told the Council: “I want to know who gave the order to kill Jamal and who else knew. I want to know where is his body.” “Those who are behind the murder and cover-up should face punishment,” she said.

"442"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-us-is-trying-to-bring-us-to-our-knees-with-their-sanctions-north/"|"Adam Schreck Hyung-Jin Kim Kim Tong-Hyung"|"North Korean and U.S. officials are holding “behind-the-scenes talks” to arrange a third summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un on the fate of the North’s expanding nuclear arsenal, South Korea’s president said, four months after a second meeting between the leaders in Vietnam collapsed without any agreement. There have been no public meetings between Washington and Pyongyang since the breakdown of the Vietnam summit. But the prospects for a resumption of U.S.-North Korea diplomacy have brightened since Trump and Kim recently exchanged personal letters. Trump called Kim’s letter “beautiful” while Kim described Trump’s as “excellent,” though the contents of their letters have not been disclosed. Trump was asked Wednesday as he departed for Asia if he would be meeting with Kim at the Group of 20 summit in Japan. Trump said he wouldn’t be meeting with Kim, but then added: “I may be speaking with him in a different forum. I will be going, as you know, to South Korea after the summit.” He didn’t elaborate. In a response Tuesday to questions by The Associated Press and six other news agencies, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said that Trump’s and Kim’s “willingness to engage in dialogue has never faded” and that their recent letter exchanges prove that. Moon, a liberal who met Kim three times last year, has made dialogue with the North as a means to forging peace on the Korean Peninsula a centrepiece of his presidency. He has played a central role in facilitating U.S.-North Korean negotiations, even if those efforts have at times been overshadowed by the Trump-Kim talks that he helped broker. Moon said he doesn’t see the Vietnam summit as a failure. He said he thinks the meeting served as a chance for both Washington and Pyongyang to better understand each other’s positions and “put everything they want on the negotiating table.” “The success of denuclearization and the peace process on the Korean Peninsula cannot be determined by a summit or two,” Moon said, adding that the discussions in Vietnam will form the basis for future talks. “Both sides clearly understand the necessity for dialogue,” he added. Despite the deadlocked nuclear negotiations, both Trump and Kim have described their personal relationship as good. When asked whether Kim’s recent letter included a mention about another summit, Trump said, “Maybe there was.” “But we, you know, at some point, we’ll do that,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday. “Getting along very well. He’s not doing nuclear testing,” he said. In yet another reminder of North Korea’s continued mistrust of the United States, its foreign ministry said earlier Wednesday it won’t surrender to U.S.-led sanctions and accused Washington of trying to “bring us to our knees.” Kim has said North Korea will seek a “new way” if the United States persists with sanctions and pressure. Following his setback in Vietnam, Kim travelled to the Russian Far East in April for his first summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Kim also hosted Chinese President Xi Jinping in Pyongyang last week for their fifth summit since March last year, and experts say the North’s outreach to its traditional allies is aimed at strengthening its leverage with the Trump administration. Moon said he views the North’s expanding diplomacy with Beijing and Moscow as a positive development in efforts to resolve the nuclear standoff. “China and Russia have continued to play constructive roles so far to peacefully resolve the Korean Peninsula issue,” he said. “I hope that China and Russia will play specific parts in helping the North resume dialogue at an early stage.” Moon didn’t elaborate whether U.S and North Korean officials had face-to-face meetings and if so where they took place. He also didn’t clarify who were interlocutors or how close they were in setting up a third Kim-Trump summit. Trump’s top envoy on North Korea, Stephen Biegun, is to visit South Korea on Thursday, and some experts said he may use his trip as a chance to meet North Korean officials at a Korean border village. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday the U.S. was prepared to resume talks with North Korea “at a moment’s notice” if the North signalled it wanted discussions about denuclearization. Despite a possible restart of negotiations, it’s still unclear whether Washington and Pyongyang can eventually achieve agreements that can satisfy both sides. The Vietnam summit fell apart after Trump rejected Kim’s calls for major sanctions relief in return for dismantling his main nuclear complex, something that U.S. officials see as a partial denuclearization step. Kim has since fired missiles and other weapons into the sea and asked Trump to work out mutually acceptable agreements by the end of this December. U.S. officials maintain sanctions on North Korea would remain in place until North Korea takes significant steps toward nuclear disarmament. North Korea has long bristled at the significant U.S. military presence in South Korea, and wants assurances it will not be targeted by the U.S. and South Korea. It sees its pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles as an insurance policy against military action. In his written replies, Moon said he has found Kim to be a “flexible yet resolute person” during their talks. He said he believes that Kim’s “unequivocal resolve is to move from the past to the future” by pursuing economic growth over building up a nuclear arsenal. The South Korean leader repeated that Kim has never linked denuclearization with South Korea’s military alliance with the U.S. or a pullout of American troops when they met. Separately from the unofficial Washington-Pyongyang talks, Moon said the two Koreas have also been holding dialogue via unspecified “diverse channels” and repeated that he’s ready to meet Kim again at any place and time. “It depends on Chairman Kim Jong-un,” Moon wrote. “I am prepared to meet with Chairman Kim in person at any given moment without being restrained by time, place or formalities.” Last year saw a flurry of inter-Korean exchanges and co-operation programs between the Koreas, which have been split along the world’s most heavily fortified border since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. But North Korea has significantly reduced its dialogue and engagement with South Korea since the end of the Vietnam summit. South Korea is now solely proceeding with a search of Korean War dead at the border, which it was supposed to jointly conduct with North Korea. North Korea has also ignored South Korean proposals for joint efforts to stem the spread of highly contagious African swine fever following an outbreak in the North. Moon, who has stressed that South Korea should be in the “driver’s seat” in international efforts to deal with North Korea, reiterated his view that the resumption of inter-Korean economic projects currently held back by the UN sanctions would help induce further denuclearization steps from the North. Following the Vietnam summit, Moon had said Seoul would “consult” with Washington on resuming operations at an inter-Korean factory park in the North Korean border city of Kaesong and restarting South Korean tours to the North’s scenic Diamond Mountain resort. While acknowledging that the resumption of such joint inter-Korean projects would depend on a substantive progress in U.S.-North Korea talks, Moon said improved economic relations between the Koreas would be “conductive” to the larger nuclear negotiations. “History has shown that North Korean nuclear threats diminish when inter-Korean relations are good,” Moon wrote. He said that the dismantling of the Yongbyon nuclear complex, which Kim offered in Vietnam, could mean that the North’s denuclearization process has entered “an irreversible stage” if it’s completely demolished and verified. He said “substantive process” in U.S.-North Korea diplomacy could also help the international community seek a partial or gradual easing of the UN sanctions. Yongbyon has facilities to produce both plutonium and highly enriched uranium, two key nuclear ingredients. North Korea has called the complex “the heart” of its nuclear program, while many outside experts say it’s an aging facility and that North Korea is believed to have additional multiple secret uranium enrichment facilities. Moon repeated earlier claims that Kim has genuine willingness to trade his nuclear weapons for economic and security benefits, but that it would be important to create an environment where the North could focus on taking relevant steps toward disarmament. “Chairman Kim should be helped along the path toward that goal in a way that sustains his commitment to nuclear dismantlement,” Moon wrote. “I think creating a security environment where Chairman Kim can decisively act on nuclear dismantlement without worries is the fastest way to achieve denuclearization diplomatically,” Moon added, without specifying the security concessions Washington and Seoul could make.

Iran suggested it was just one day from breaching a limit in the 2015 nuclear deal that restricted its stockpile of uranium, a move that would pressure European countries aiming to be neutral to pick sides. The fate of the multilateral nuclear deal, under which Iran agreed to curbs on its nuclear program in return for relief from economic sanctions, has been at the heart of the U.S.-Iran dispute which took on a military dimension in recent weeks. Last week Iran shot down a U.S. drone it said was in its air space, which Washington denied. Trump called off retaliatory air strikes at the last minute, saying too many people would have died. Washington also accused Tehran or its proxies of attacks in May and June on six tankers in the Gulf region, which Iran denies. Asked on Fox Business Network if a war was brewing, Trump replied: “I hope we don’t but we’re in a very strong position if something should happen.” “I’m not talking boots on the ground,” Trump said. “I’m just saying if something would happen, it wouldn’t last very long.” Speaking later at a gathering of religious conservatives, the U.S. president talked about whether there could be a new agreement with Iran, suggesting he could live without one. “If it doesn’t happen, that’s fine with me,” Trump said. “I have unlimited time, as far as I’m concerned.” Trump last year unilaterally withdrew from the nuclear deal with Iran struck by his predecessor President Barack Obama, arguing that it did not go far enough to restrict Iran’s nuclear and missile programs and other activities in the Middle East. He has since reimposed U.S. economic sanctions on Iran, including taking the unprecedented step in May of trying to drive Iran’s oil exports to zero. Iran warned the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday that it would no longer be burdened with preserving the pact, originally struck by Iran and Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States. European states pushed Tehran to stick with the agreement because there was no peaceful alternative. “Iran alone cannot, shall not and will not take all of the burdens any more to preserve the JCPOA,” Iran’s U.N. Ambassador Majid Takht Ravanchi told the 15-member Security Council, using the acronym for the deal’s formal name, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. U.S. allies warn that an increase in tensions could accidentally lead to war. Iran and world powers including the United States who struck the nuclear pact needed to find a way back into talks, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday. “I believe the escalation, sanctions on top of sanctions, provocations, the military buildup, is extremely dangerous because it could ignite the region, it could lead to overreactions,” he told Japanese broadcaster NHK before a G20 summit in Osaka. “When confidence is lost, you need little gestures to reduce tensions.” Although the United States and Iran both say they do not want war, last week’s aborted U.S. strikes have been followed by menacing rhetoric on both sides. On Tuesday Trump threatened the “obliteration” of parts of Iran if it struck U.S. interests. President Hassan Rouhani, who normally presents Tehran’s mild-mannered face, called White House policy “mentally retarded.” The standoff creates a challenge for Washington which, after quitting the nuclear deal against the advice of European allies, is now seeking their support to force Iran to comply with it. Over the past few weeks Iran has set a number of deadlines for European countries to protect its economy from the impact of U.S. sanctions or see Tehran reduce compliance with the deal. A spokesman for Iran’s Atomic Energy Organisation said that one of those deadlines would expire on Thursday, with Iran potentially exceeding a limit imposed under the deal to keep its stockpile of enriched uranium below 300 kg. The IRIB news agency quoted spokesman Behrouz Kamalvindi as saying that after the deadline Iran would speed up its rate of producing the material. Another threshold bars Iran from enriching uranium to a purity beyond 3.67 per cent fissile material. It has set a deadline of July 7 after which it could also breach that. European nations have tried to save the deal by maintaining some of its economic benefits despite U.S. sanctions. So far they have failed, with Iran largely shut from oil markets and all major European companies cancelling plans to invest. Senior British, French, German and U.S. diplomats meet in Paris on Thursday, and senior officials from the six nations still in the deal gather in Vienna on Friday for talks that may explore whether the deal can be salvaged through diplomacy. Iran says it would be Washington’s fault if it exceeds the 300 kg stockpile threshold. The 2015 deal allows Iran to sell excess uranium abroad to keep its stockpile below the limit, but such sales have been blocked by U.S. sanctions.

The cause was complications from cancer, according to a statement from WGN America, which was working on a new spinoff at the time of Ms. Chapman’s death. Ms. Chapman and her husband, Duane Chapman, known as Dog, rose to prominence with the 2004 premiere of Dog the Bounty Hunter, which followed the couple’s unusual family business: tracking down and detaining people in Hawaii and Colorado who had violated the terms of their release from custody. The show lasted for eight seasons and was followed by a three-season spinoff and a two-hour special on her battle with cancer, which kept Ms. Chapman and her family on TV and in the public eye for well over a decade. “It’s 5:32 in Hawaii, this is the time she would wake up to go hike Koko Head mountain,” Mr. Chapman wrote on Twitter Wednesday morning. “Only today, she hiked the stairway to heaven. We all love you, Beth. See you on the other side.” Ms. Chapman was diagnosed with Stage 2 throat cancer in September, 2017, according to an interview she gave The Honolulu Star-Advertiser in January. The cancer returned last November, which led to emergency surgery and what she described as a nationwide search for experimental treatments that sometimes took her far from her home in Hawaii. “Even though the outlook is grim, I just don’t want to live it like that, you know?” she told The Star-Advertiser in a video interview. “I don’t want to be that person who lets their children watch them die at their bedside,” she added. “It’s just really out of my character. So, for the last four days, I have been chasing bad guys on the Big Island and I didn’t even notice that I was sick.” Dog the Bounty Hunter was a game changer for A&E, which previously had been largely known for more high-minded but low-rated arts programming. The show quickly turned the Chapman family into symbols of the network and a prototype of sorts for reality shows about rough-around-the-edges family businesses, such as Duck Dynasty. That show premiered on A&E in 2012, the same year the network cancelled Dog the Bounty Hunter. But the show’s cancellation did not end the Chapman family’s career as reality stars. Dog and Beth: On the Hunt, a spinoff of the A&E show, had three seasons on CMT. It followed the family as they travelled the country working with bail bondsmen in different cities. Ms. Chapman also addressed her experiences living with cancer in a two-hour special on A&E in November, 2017, Dog and Beth: Fight of Their Lives. The family was at work on a second spinoff, Dog’s Most Wanted, for WGN America that was in production at the time of Ms. Chapman’s death. The network said this year that the show would debut in 2020. A spokeswoman for WGN America said on Wednesday that the network did not yet know how her death would affect the show.

"445"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-fire-at-notre-dame-cathedral-may-have-been-caused-by-electrical-fault/"|"Elaine Ganley"|"A preliminary investigation found no evidence to suggest that a fire that gutted large parts of Notre Dame Cathedral was criminal, the prosecutor’s office said Wednesday. The prosecutor’s office said in a statement that several hypotheses about the cause of the April 15 blaze include a malfunctioning electrical system or a smouldering cigarette – to be further investigated in a new probe. The prosecutor’s office announced the opening of a judicial investigation led by three judges for “involuntary degradation by fire through manifestly deliberate violation” of security rules or simple imprudence. It targets “X,” meaning anyone or any entity suspected. The 13th-century cathedral was under renovation at the time of the fire and scaffolding criss-crossed the back of the edifice where the spire was once located. The fire tore through the roof, destroying the spire which toppled in flames and vast sections of the interior. It has left the crippled monument, once a major tourist attraction, barricaded to the public and the faithful. In the preliminary investigation, judicial police examined more than 1,200 clues and heard testimony from about 100 people. “If certain deficiencies, by which the size of the disaster could be the consequence, were made clear, the investigations have not thus far allowed us to determine the causes of the fire,” the prosecutor’s office said. As the detective work continues, workers are taking on what officials have said it one of the most complex operations – cutting down the 50,000 tubes of scaffolding erected for the initial prefire renovation. The tubes reached more than 800 C during the fire, according to a statement Wednesday by the Notre Dame Foundation. French President Emmanuel Macron has said he wants the renovations completed in five years. Paris plays host to the Olympics in 2024, but numerous experts question whether the cathedral can be operational by then. The costs of the gargantuan task of renovating the monument won’t be known until spring, 2020, but they are bound to be as colossal as the cathedral – and current headaches over payments. However, some relief was in sight. The Notre Dame Foundation announced Wednesday that major French donors – Bernard Arnault, his family and luxury giant LVMH – have made an initial payment of €10-million ($14.9-million) on a pledge of €200-million, as have François Pinault and François-Henri Pinault, who pledged €100-million. No funds had previously been forthcoming. The Notre Dame Foundation said the initial payments were made “at the initiative” of the foundation. However, word that two of France’s richest men were finally issuing funds came after The Associated Press and others reported this month that major French donors weren’t paying into their pledges but instead waiting to see how the funds would be used. The Notre Dame Foundation’s Cathedrale de Paris Fund has so far raised €396-million in donations and pledges. But pure donations to pay companies working on the site total €38-million – coming from 42,000 individuals plus 60 companies and public authorities, the foundation said.

"446"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-dave-bartholomew-mainstay-of-new-orleans-rb-dies-at-100-2/"|"Bill Friskics-Warren"|"Dave Bartholomew, the producer, arranger, composer, trumpet player and bandleader who had a major hand in the shaping of New Orleans rhythm and blues and early rock ’n’ roll, died Sunday in New Orleans. He was 100. His death was confirmed by his son, Ron. An influential figure who worked mainly behind the scenes, Mr. Bartholomew was best known for the hits he produced for and wrote with Antoine (Fats) Domino, including Ain’t That a Shame (originally released under the name Ain’t It a Shame) and Blue Monday. Under Mr. Bartholomew’s direction, Mr. Domino placed 65 singles on the Billboard pop chart from 1955 to 1964. Among rock ’n’ roll singers, only Elvis Presley had more during that period. Mr. Bartholomew’s musical reach extended well beyond his collaborations with Mr. Domino. He also produced and arranged signature hits by Lloyd Price (Lawdy Miss Clawdy), Shirley and Lee (Let the Good Times Roll) and Smiley Lewis (I Hear You Knocking). My Ding-a-Ling, Chuck Berry’s only No. 1 pop single, was an adaptation of Little Girl Sing Ding-a-Ling, a recording Mr. Bartholomew made under his own name in 1952. Elton John, Paul McCartney, the Rolling Stones, Hank Williams Jr. and Cheap Trick, among many others, have recorded material associated with Bartholomew. “His importance cannot be overstated,” Dr. Ira Padnos, a practising anesthesiologist and the founder of the Ponderosa Stomp, a national touring revue and foundation that recognizes and promotes the work of American roots music pioneers, said in an interview for this obituary in 2010. “Dave was one of rock ’n’ roll’s first great producers,” Dr. Padnos said. “And he created what might have been the first rock ’n’ roll record with The Fat Man,” a hit for Mr. Domino in 1949. “There was nothing else like it at the time. He put a heavy backbeat behind an old blues tune and it became rock ’n’ roll.” That “big beat,” as it came to be known, was supplied by drummer Earl Palmer, one of several unerringly funky musicians whom Mr. Bartholomew recruited to work in his band. (Others included saxophonists Lee Allen and Alvin (Red) Tyler.) Besides appearing on his sessions, this tight ensemble played on Little Richard’s volcanic mid-1950s hits Tutti Frutti and Long Tall Sally. It also backed Sam Cooke, with a young Allen Toussaint on piano, during his 1960 tour of the United States. Fusing Mardi Gras parade rhythms, jump blues, big-band jazz and Tin Pan Alley pop, Mr. Bartholomew and his band created a Crescent City groove that became as enduring a part of rock ’n’ roll vernacular as Bo Diddley’s “shave-and-a-haircut” beat and Berry’s “ringin’ a bell” guitar. No less remarkable was the fact Mr. Bartholomew, a black man, achieved such prominence working in the Jim Crow South. “He was operating in a very segregated environment,” John Broven, author of Rhythm & Blues in New Orleans, said in an interview. “You had to be somebody special to rise to the top.” Dave Bartholomew was born Dec. 24, 1918, in Edgard, La. (Some sources say the year was 1920, but the family said 1918 is correct.) The son of a jazz trumpet player, he grew up in a musical home and learned to play the tuba before moving on to trumpet. He earned the nickname Leather Lungs for his ability to hold a note, and by the time he was a teenager, he had spent time in a number of the region’s most popular bands, including those led by Joe Robichaux and Papa Celestin. He later worked briefly with Jimmie Lunceford’s big band and with a military band while serving in the Army, where he began writing and arranging music. After serving in the Second World War he formed his own group, which appeared in New Orleans night spots such as the Club Tijuana and the Dew Drop Inn, before meeting the record mogul Lew Chudd, who signed Bartholomew to his label, Imperial. Mr. Bartholomew was working for the label as a talent scout when he first heard Mr. Domino perform at the Hideaway Club in New Orleans. The Fat Man, the first single the two men made together, became a national hit and offered early proof of Mr. Bartholomew’s astute mix of commercial and artistic instincts. “He was smart enough to know you couldn’t get a song named Junker Blues played on the radio,” Dr. Padnos explained, referring to the drug-themed song on which The Fat Man was based. “So he came up with The Fat Man instead. With Fats, he wrote stuff that was accessible enough that the kids would buy it.” The genial, steady-rolling arrangements Mr. Bartholomew wrote for Mr. Domino all but ensured the mainstream appeal of his music. The records Mr. Bartholomew released under his own name had more of a Caribbean or Afro-Cuban feel than his collaborations with Mr. Domino and the other youth-oriented performers whose sessions he produced. With titles such as Shrimp and Gumbo and Carnival Day, these recordings were evocative of local New Orleans culture. A broad cross-section of Mr. Bartholomew’s music, including his work with renowned blues musicians such as T-Bone Walker and Roy Brown, was presented in The Spirit of New Orleans: The Genius of Dave Bartholomew, a two-CD set released by Capitol Records in 1993. Mr. Bartholomew’s name was linked to steadily fewer hit records as the 1960s gave way to the ’70s, but he remained active into his 80s. His 1998 studio album, New Orleans Big Beat (Landslide), featured Jazz Fest in New Orleans, which became the unofficial anthem of the city’s annual Jazz and Heritage Festival. He was given a Trustees Award, for lifetime achievement, by the Recording Academy in 2014. Mr. Bartholomew leaves his wife, Rhea (Douse) Bartholomew; his daughters, Diane Wilson and Jacqueline Temple; his sons, Dave Jr., Don and Ron; three stepchildren, Alvin LaBeaud, Darrell LaBeaud and Deborah Hubbard; a sister, Thelma Cooper; 25 grandchildren; and many great-grandchildren. Mr. Bartholomew’s compositions have been included on the soundtracks of music-themed movies such as The Girl Can’t Help It (1956) and American Graffiti (1973). A member of the Songwriters Hall of Fame, he was elected to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1991. That he was inducted in the “nonperformer” category was appropriate but perhaps misleading, Mr. Broven said. In addition to being “the one who organized all the musicians and whipped everyone into shape in the studio,” he said, “he was a great musician himself, a red-hot trumpeter.” "|"Dave Bartholomew, mainstay of New Orleans R&B, dies at 100"|"2019-06-26T15:52:46-0400"|"obituary,Dave Bartholomew,world news,New Orleans,R&B,music,rock ’n’ roll,Blue Monday,Ain’t It a Shame,death,rock,bartholomew,roll,band,Mr Bartholomew", 
"447"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-venezuela-government-says-it-thwarted-plot-seeking-to-kill-nicolas/"|"Scott Smith"|"Venezuelan officials said Wednesday they foiled a plot to overthrow the government that included assassinating President Nicolas Maduro and his closest political allies. Maduro spokesman Jorge Rodriguez said on state television that a network of mostly retired police officers and soldiers planned to bomb a key government building, seize a Caracas airbase and loot Venezuela’s central bank. He also said the plotters wanted to edge opposition leader Juan Guaido from Venezuela’s political landscape. Guaido, leader of the opposition-dominated National Assembly, is seeking to oust Maduro from power with backing from more than 50 nations. Rodriguez said the purported network wanted to steal a helicopter to liberate Raul Baduel, a former defence minister now in jail and install him as president. The government has claimed various plots over the years, generally offering little or no evidence to back its charges. The opposition contends Maduro uses such claims to justify his crackdown on dissent. Guaido, who said members of his own political team were confronted by armed men from Maduro’s security forces early Wednesday, dismissed the latest claim as yet another attempt by the government to distract from Venezuela’s real problems. Maduro came under attack last August by two drones loaded with explosives, which detonated near the president while he spoke at an outdoor military celebration. He was not harmed in the attack, which officials called an assassination attempt. Rodriguez charged that Colombian President Ivan Duque and Chilean President Sebastian Pinera backed the purportedly thwarted coup plot, but he didn’t provide evidence. Rodriguez showed what he said were scenes from 56 hours of intercepted video conference calls with the alleged plotters hashing out strategy for the attack planned for June 23. The spokesman said first lady Cilia Flores and Diosdado Cabello, leader of Venezuela’s governing socialist party, were among those also targeted for assassination. Maduro in a nationally televised address said later that the plotters were cowards backed by the United States. “That’s not called politics,” Maduro said. “That’s called fascism.” Meanwhile, Guaido said members of his team were detained early Wednesday on a Caracas highway by armed men on motorcycles. They wore civilian clothes and didn’t identify themselves, but Guaido later said they were Maduro loyalists. The men told Guaido’s political staffers they would be taken to the headquarters of counter-intelligence military police. Guaido quickly arrived to defuse the situation by talking with the armed men, who left. “Let it be clear to the regime that they will not intimidate us,” Guaido said at a news conference, urging members of the police and military to stop taking orders from Maduro’s regime.

"448"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-rescue-ship-with-42-migrants-defies-italy-order-to-stay-out/"|"Colleen Barry"|"A private sea rescue ship carrying 42 migrants it took aboard off Libya two weeks ago entered Italian waters Wednesday despite an explicit ban from Italy’s interior minister, who has threatened to seize the ship operated by a German aid organization and to arrest its captain. Interior Minister Matteo Salvini said the captain of the Sea-Watch 3 broke the law both by disobeying direct orders not to cross into Italy’s territorial waters and by flouting measures that bar the migrant rescue ships of non-profit groups from entering Italian jurisdiction. “The right to defend our borders is sacred,” Salvini said. Italian media played a recording of the ship’s captain informing port authorities Wednesday she was heading to Italy “because I cannot guarantee the safety of the people on board any more.” The response from the port was “You are not authorized to enter Italian waters.” Salvini has insisted the ship belonging to German group Sea-Watch and sailing under a Dutch flag should have continued on to Malta, Tunisia or northern European ports instead of remaining near Italy. The crew insisted that Italy’s Lampedusa island had the safe port nearest to migrants’ point of rescue north of Libyan waters. Hours after Sea-Watch 3 arrived off the coast of Lampedusa on Wednesday, there was no sign the migrants would be allowed to get off the ship in Italy or any other move to end the standoff. Given the boat’s Dutch flag, Italy requested “formal steps” from the Netherlands through its embassy in The Hague, the Italian Foreign Ministry said. Meanwhile, Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte met with Salvini and Foreign Minister Enzo Moavero Milanesi in Rome to discuss the situation. The captain of Sea-Watch 3, Carola Rackete, said in a video posted on Twitter that Italian authorities had boarded the ship to check documentation and the crew’s passports. The authorities “are waiting for further instructions from their superiors,” she said. “I really hope they will take the rescues off the ship soon.” In a separate post, she said she knew she risked arrest “but the 42 rescued are exhausted. I need to bring them to safety.” Sea-Watch spokesman Ruben Neugebereger said the crew had previously requested permission to port in Malta and was turned down. Sea-Watch also asked the European Union’s executive commission to intervene and help find a port that will allow the ship, Neugebauer said. The European Commission had been in touch with “several member states” by midday to identify a port where the migrants could disembark and countries willing to take the passengers in after that, spokeswoman Natasha Bertaud said. She said no decisions were made. Sea-Watch said that the migrants had become desperate after the European Court of Human Rights on Tuesday rejected their appeal to be allowed to disembark in Italy. Those on board are among 53 that the group said it rescued June 12 from a rubber boat off Libya in international waters. In the meantime, 11 have been evacuated to Italy for medical reasons. The remaining 42 include a 12 year old and two other children travelling alone. The group’s cultural mediator, Haidi Sadik, said many on board have been tortured in Libya. “But even if this was not the case, any person rescued at sea, by law has to be brought to a place of safety. These are people with basic needs and basic rights. A rescue operation is not finished until every single person rescued has both feet on the ground,” Sadik said. It is the latest standoff since Italy’s populist government began refusing port last year to humanitarian rescue ships. Salvini claims the boat’s aid migrant traffickers by waiting off the Libyan coast to pick up migrants from unseaworthy vessels that couldn’t make it all the way to Europe. He also is trying to push the European Union to find a way to take the pressure of dealing with migrants off Italy, a main entry point due to its southern Mediterranean location. EU rules require the country asylum-seekers reach first to consider applications for protection, a process that has kept new arrivals in Italy for extended periods. But at the same time, the mayor of Lampedusa told broadcaster Sky TG24 that migrants continue to arrive on other boats, often from Tunisia, that aren’t operated by private groups. He said eight migrants arrived Tuesday evening on a boat that a police vessel towed to port. In Turkey, where an EU agreement with the government has stem the number of Europe-bound migrants, officials said Wednesday that a van carrying dozens of migrants ignored orders to stop and sped past a police checkpoint before crashing into a wall. Ten migrants were killed and about 30 others were injured in the crash. Many migrants try to enter European Union member Greece from Turkey by sea, making a relatively short crossing to nearby Greek islands. Others take a northern land route.

"449"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-asian-shares-going-nowhere-as-g20-looms-large/"|"Wayne Cole"|"Asian markets were busy going nowhere on Thursday as confusion shrouded the chances of any progress in the Sino-U.S. trade standoff, while bulls scaled back wagers for a drastic cut in U.S. interest rates. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that a trade deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping was possible this weekend but warned he was prepared to impose U.S. tariffs on virtually all remaining Chinese imports if talks fail. Trump also raised the possibility that he may impose a lower, 10 per cent duty on a US$300-billion list of Chinese imports, instead of the proposed 25 per cent rate. Enroute to the G20 meeting in Japan on Air Force One, Trump later tweeted he was “off to save the Free World!” “The best that can be hoped for is a ceasefire that avoids incremental tariffs and helps set the stage for further talks, and this isn’t a scenario that equities should necessarily be celebrating,” said analysts at JPMorgan in a note. Investors were clearly on the sidelines with MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dipping 0.01% in very light trade. Japan’s Nikkei added 0.3 per cent, helped by a pullback in the yen, while Australian stocks eased 0.4 per cent. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 were 0.03 per cent firmer. Wall Street had been equally circumspect, with the Dow ending Wednesday down 0.04 per cent, while the S&P 500 lost 0.12 per cent and the Nasdaq rose 0.32 per cent. Trump had also weighed into U.S. monetary policy on Wednesday, accusing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell of doing a “bad job” and “out to prove how tough he is” by not cutting interest rates. Markets are convinced the Fed will indeed ease at its next meeting in July, but had to scale back bets on a half-point cut following cautious comments from various policy makers. Futures are 100 per cent priced for a cut of 25 basis points, and imply a 22 per cent chance of 50 basis points. Treasury yields edged up in response, though the two-year is only just above 19-month lows at 1.77 per cent. That in turn eased the selling pressure on the U.S. dollar, which inched up to 96.175 on a basket of currencies from a three-month trough of 95.843. The dollar bounced modestly on the yen to 107.76 and away from a low of 106.77. The euro likewise eased back to US$1.1371 from a top of US$1.1412. The dollar’s gains took a little of the shine off gold, which broke a six-session winning stretch and eased to US$1,410.12 per ounce. Oil prices ran into profit-taking in early Asia, having gained overnight on a larger-than-expected drawdown in crude stocks as exports hit a record high and surprise falls in refined product stockpiles. [O/R] Brent crude futures eased 54 cents to US$65.95, while U.S. crude lost 48 cents to US$58.84 a barrel.

"450"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-german-police-arrest-two-more-suspects-linked-to-politicians-murder/"|"Joseph Nasr"|"German police have detained two suspects in the murder of a pro-immigration politician shot by a far-right sympathizer who has confessed to the crime, federal prosecutors said on Thursday. They said one of the men, identified as Elmar J., had sold the gun Stephen E. used to shoot Walter Luebcke, who was found lying outside his home in the state of Hesse on June 2. German privacy laws prohibit publishing their family names. The second suspect, Markus H., is believed to have been a middleman who introduced Stephen E. to the gun dealer, the Federal Prosecutors’ Office said in a statement. The suspects were detained on Wednesday in Kassel, where Luebcke was murdered, and Hoexter, a town about 70 km (45 miles) to the north. Their apartments were searched, the prosecutors said, giving no details. Luebcke’s killing has revived a debate about whether Germany is doing enough to combat far-right groups, after the chance discovery in 2011 of a neo-Nazi cell, the National Socialist Underground (NSU), whose members murdered eight Turks, a Greek man and a German policewoman from 2000 to 2007. Prosecutors said the two suspects were aware that Stephan E. was a far-right sympathizer and that he would possibly use the .38-calibre gun to commit a political murder. The prosecutors’ office added, however, that they were probably unaware of his specific plot to murder Luebcke. The BfV, Germany’s domestic intelligence agency, said in its annual report published on Thursday that the number of “violence-orientated right-wing extremists” had risen to a record of 12,700. “Given the high affinity for carrying weapons in the far-right extremist spectrum, those numbers are extremely worrying,” Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said, presenting the report. “The risk of an attack is high.” Seehofer had said on Wednesday that the investigation of Luebcke’s murder would continue even though Stephan E. confessed to the crime and told investigators he had acted alone. Seehofer also said security services would get more staff and resources to monitor far-right groups, especially on the Internet. Investigators said Stephan E.’s DNA matched forensic samples collected on the terrace where Luebcke, who headed the regional government in the city of Kassel, was found dead. Luebcke was a hate figure on far-right Internet forums critical of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s 2015 decision to welcome around a million refugees at the height of the refugee crisis. The 2011 discovery of the NSU unleashed fierce criticism of the intelligence agencies and police for underestimating the risk of far-right violence. Reforms were then introduced, such as closer co-ordination between agencies and regions. Merkel’s Christian Democrats, of which Luebcke was a member, have said the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) must share blame for the Luebcke murder by having legitimized a language of hate that encourages political violence. The AfD has rejected suggestions that its anti-immigration stance was to blame for Luebcke’s death and said its own members were the victims of left-wing violence. On Wednesday, a regional AfD lawmaker in the Bavarian parliament was condemned after he remained seated as the chamber stood for a minute’s silence to remember Luebcke.

Millions have thronged the streets in the past three weeks to demand that the bill, which would allow criminal suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial in courts controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, be scrapped altogether. “You know what everybody has deep in their hearts – is that this is about our future and it’s very very personal,” said 53-year-old Brian Kern, who was attending the protests. In sweltering heat of 32 degrees C (89.6°F), some protesters chanted, “Withdraw evil law, release martyrs … Teresa Cheng, come out,” referring to the justice secretary. Others shouted, “Condemn excessive force by police and release protesters.” Police formed a cordon to block the demonstrators and one officer held a banner warning them away. Minor scuffles broke out between pro-democracy group Demosisto and officers. “Fight for Justice,” “Free Hong Kong,” and “Democracy Now” were some of the demands emblazoned on protest banners. Police chief Stephen Lo warned of consequences for outbreaks of violence and condemned what he said was an environment of hostility making his officers’ task difficult. In the early hours, riot police wielding batons and shields chased dozens of protesters as they broke up a siege of police headquarters. By nightfall on Thursday, only around 200 protesters remained. Black-clad and masked, they sat peacefully outside government headquarters. The demonstrators have seized on this week’s G20 summit of world leaders in Japan to appeal for Hong Kong’s plight to be put on the agenda, a move certain to rile Beijing, which has vowed not to tolerate such discussion. “We know that the G20 is coming. We want to grasp this opportunity to voice for ourselves,” said Jack Cool Tsang, 30, a theatre technician who took a day off work to protest. Images of police firing rubber bullets and tear gas beneath gleaming skyscrapers this month near the heart of the financial centre grabbed global headlines and drew condemnation from international rights groups and protest organizers. Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam, who has kept a low profile since her latest public apology over a week ago, bowed to public pressure and suspended the bill a day after the violent protests but stopped short of cancelling the measure outright and rejected repeated calls to step down. Opponents of the extradition bill fear being placed at the mercy of a justice system rights group say is plagued by torture, forced confessions and arbitrary detentions. The demonstrations, which pose the greatest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he took power in 2012, have repeatedly forced the temporary closure of government offices, blocked major roads and caused massive disruptions. Since Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997, it has been governed under a “one country, two systems” formula that allows freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China, including the liberty to protest and an independent judiciary. But many accuse China of increased meddling over the years, by obstructing democratic reform, interfering with elections, suppressing young activists, as well as being behind the disappearance of five Hong Kong-based booksellers who specialized in works critical of Chinese leaders. A Hong Kong government statement said Lam had met senior police officers to express thanks for their dedication during the protests and gave them her full support to maintain law and order in the city. “She said she understands that members of the force and their family members have been put under pressure and that a small number of people even provoked the police intentionally, which is not acceptable,” the statement said. Lam also met representatives in the education and religious sectors, senior civil servants as well as foreign consuls to exchange views on the “current social situation,” it said.

Babis, a billionaire turned politician, has faced pressure from investigations into alleged fraud over EU subsidies and conflicts of interest regarding ties to his former business empire, one of the largest in the central European EU nation. The no-confidence motion called by the opposition secured just 85 votes in the 200-seat lower house of parliament after 17 hours of debate that stretched past midnight. The outcome was expected after ANO’s coalition partner, the centre-left Social Democrats, and the Communist party, which has also been backing the government, both declined to join opposition parties to oust Babis. Babis denies wrongdoing and has called investigations against him a plot by opponents. Despite a slight slide in the latest opinion poll, ANO remains the most popular party by a wide margin. “I take this initiative as an attempt to destabilize the country,” Babis told parliament before the vote. “We do not want (early election) and I hope that our government rules until the end of its mandate.” The vote gives Babis temporary respite but he will face pressure both in the short run and in the longer term. The Social Democrats’ relationship with ANO has been increasingly fragile, and a number of party officials have spoken in favour of leaving the cabinet. On Thursday, the party said it would again weigh whether to quit, irked by President Milos Zeman’s refusal to appoint a new culture minister from their ranks. Party officials said Babis should use legal means to force the president to act, but Babis has avoided confrontation with Zeman. A cabinet reconstruction would make Zeman the key power broker, as he appoints the prime minister and ministers. The government may survive losing the Social Democrats by leaning on the support of the Communists as well as the far-right, anti-European Freedom and Direct Democracy (SPD) party. Babis had in the past however shunned an alliance with the far right. On Sunday, more than a quarter a million people demanded that Babis quit in the biggest public protest in the country of 10.7 million since the end of communist rule in 1989. Prosecutors are weighing whether to force him to stand trial over suspected fraud when getting a 2 million euro European subsidy for a hotel and conference centre a decade ago. Around year-end, the European Commission will also finalize audits whose preliminary findings showed Babis had a conflict of interest and some of his former firms, now sitting in trust funds, received millions of euros in EU aid illegally. The EU audit could be a headache for Babis if it means his former chemicals, food, media and farming empire employing more than 30,000 people has to return some past EU aid and loses access to future funding. Under that scenario analysts have said Babis may decide to step aside himself and nominate a loyalist colleague as prime minister while continuing as decision-maker behind the scenes.

"453"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-indonesias-top-court-rules-against-challenge-to-election-result/"|"Stephen Wright Niniek Karmini"|"Indonesia’s top court Thursday rejected a losing presidential candidate’s allegations of massive and systematic election fraud, sealing a second term for Joko Widodo, who in fending off the rising power of Islamists has drifted toward authoritarian tactics. The constitutional Court, which took a marathon nine hours to publicly read its reasoning on the case, said the legal team of the losing candidate, former Gen. Prabowo Subianto, had failed to prove allegations that included millions of fake voters and biased state institutions. The court’s ruling is final. Thousands of police and soldiers were deployed to boost security in Jakarta as authorities strove to avoid a repeat of deadly riots last month. Pro-Subianto protesters who had gathered near the court melted away around dusk as the broadcast of proceedings on a TV screen outside indicated their candidate’s case was unsuccessful. The official election results released last month showed Widodo won 55.5 per cent of the vote but also revealed a polarized electorate. Subianto, who allied himself with groups that want Islamic rather than secular law to prevail in the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation, won big victories in conservative provinces. The legal challenge’s failure was widely expected after documents filed with the court showed that much of the evidence for the alleged fraud in the April 17 election was printouts of tangentially related news articles from online sites of varying quality. The evidence purporting to show police bias in favour of Widodo included allegations from an anonymous Twitter account. The hearings were broadcast on national TV and showed the testimony of some witnesses disintegrating under questioning from the panel of judges. Widodo, the first Indonesian president from outside the Jakarta elite, said Indonesians should reunite after a divisive election campaign. “In the election our political choices are different but the elected president and vice-president are the president and vice-president for all children of the nation, for all Indonesians,” he said. HIs administration, however, has increasingly flirted with authoritarianism, using a draconian presidential decree to ban an Islamic group that promoted Indonesia becoming a caliphate and allowing authorities to arrest opponents under an easily abused hate speech law. The legal challenge appeared to be partly an attempt to strengthen the hand of Subianto’s party, Gerindra, which has been negotiating with Widodo’s governing coalition for Cabinet positions. Minutes after the ruling, Subianto said he had “respect” for it, reducing the risk of more violent protests but also raising the possibility of his party joining Widodo’s government and leaving the world’s third-largest democracy without a significant parliamentary opposition. “The ruling is very disappointing for us and our supporters, but we have committed to obey the constitution and we respect the constitutional Court’s decision,” he said. Subianto, linked to human rights abuses during the authoritarian rule of Suharto, also unsuccessfully challenged his presidential election loss to Widodo in 2014 and has now made four unsuccessful bids for the presidency. Nine people died in what police said were orchestrated riots in Jakarta after the official results were released May 21. Amnesty International has said police used disproportionate force against protesters that resulted in unlawful killings and other human rights violations.

Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks, the militant group’s Amaq news agency said on Thursday evening. The attacks came months before an election and at the peak of a tourist season in which Tunisia is hoping for a record number of visitors. The first suicide bomber targeted a police patrol in Charles de Gaulle Street in central Tunis. One police officer was killed and at least one other as well as three civilians were wounded, the Interior Ministry said. Shortly afterwards, a second bomber blew himself up near a police station in the al-Gorjani district. Four people were wounded, the ministry said. Heavily armed police cordoned off the locations of the attacks, one of which was about 200 metres away from the French embassy. Reuters witnesses saw people rushing away from the scene, while the body of one suicide bomber lay on the ground. “I was shopping with my daughter and we heard a big explosion. We saw the body of the terrorist lying on the ground near a police vehicle after he blew himself up,” said a man who give his name only as Mohamed. Interior Ministry spokesman Sofian Zaak said the attackers had not yet been identified, and he called on the public to show strength and not panic. Tunisia has been battling militant groups operating in remote areas near the border with Algeria since an uprising overthrew autocratic leader Zine Abidine Ben Ali in 2011. High unemployment has also stoked unrest in recent years. Last October, a woman blew herself up in the centre of the capital Tunis, wounding 15 people including 10 police officers in an explosion that broke a long period of calm after dozens had died in militant attacks in 2015. Security has improved since authorities imposed a state of emergency in November 2015 after those attacks – one at a museum in Tunis and another on a beach in the Mediterranean seaside town of Sousse. A third attack targeted presidential guards in the capital. Islamic State claimed responsibility. The attacks scared off holidaymakers and investors, worsening the country’s economic problems.

One of Essebsi’s advisers told Reuters during the day that he was in a “very critical” condition. On Thursday evening, the adviser said the president’s condition was beginning to improve, without elaborating. Prime Minister Youssef Chahed said on Facebook that Essebsi was receiving the attention he needed and that people should stop spreading fake news about his condition, after some reports said the president had died. The presidency said in a new statement that “his condition now is stable and he is under the necessary checks.” The elderly head of state was hospitalized last week as well, for what the presidency described as nonserious treatment. Essebsi has been a prominent figure in Tunisia since the overthrow of Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali in 2011, which was followed by uprisings against other autocratic leaders across the Middle East, including in nearby Libya and Egypt. Tunisia set itself on a path to democracy without much of the violence seen elsewhere, although it has been the target of militant Islamists over the years. On Thursday, two suicide bombers blew themselves up in attacks on police in the capital Tunis, killing one officer and wounding several others. Militant attacks in 2015 left dozens of people dead and drove away foreign tourists and investors alike. Government troops have been battling militant groups in remote areas near the border with Algeria, while high unemployment has also stoked unrest in recent years. After the overthrow of Ben Ali, Essebsi led the immediate transition as prime minister in 2011. He was elected president three years later. Essebsi had also been a senior figure before 2011, having served as foreign minister under state founder Habib Bourguiba and parliamentary speaker under Ben Ali. In June, he said he would not run for a second term in elections this year, despite his party calling for him to stand. The party has not identified another candidate yet. Parliamentary elections are expected to be held on Oct. 6 with a presidential vote following on Nov. 17. Under a new constitution guaranteeing democratic freedoms, Essebsi has limited powers compared with Ben Ali, and he is mainly responsible for foreign and defence policies. The day-to-day business of government and economic policy is run by Prime Minister Chahed, in office since 2016. He is also the main contact person for the International Monetary Fund and other donors that have kept Tunisia afloat amid its economic crisis. Tunisia has been hailed as the only democratic success of the Arab Spring uprisings against dictatorship, with a new constitution and free elections in 2011 and 2014. But political progress has not been matched by economic advances. Unemployment stands at about 15 per cent, up from 12 per cent in 2010, due to weak growth and low investment.

NASA said Thursday that it’s sending a drone called Dragonfly to explore Saturn’s largest moon, Titan. Using propellers, the drone will fly and land on several locations on the icy moon to study whether it can support microbial life. The nuclear-powered mission is part of NASA’s competitive New Frontiers program, which launched the New Horizons spacecraft that became the first to visit dwarf planet Pluto. Dragonfly beat out nearly a dozen proposed projects, including a mission to collect samples from a nearby comet. The drone is slated to launch in 2026 and arrive at Titan in 2034. The plan is to land on some of Titan’s dunes and later on a crater. “What really excites me about this mission is that Titan has all the ingredients needed for life,” said Lori Glaze, director of NASA’s planetary science division. Titan is a haze-covered world with a thick atmosphere. The moon has lakes of methane, mountains of ice and an ocean below the surface, making it an attractive place to explore whether its environment can support primitive life. “We are absolutely thrilled, and everyone is just raring to go and take the next steps in exploring Titan,” said project leader Elizabeth Turtle of Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland. She added: Titan was last studied by the international Cassini-Huygens mission. In 2017, the Cassini spacecraft plunged into Saturn, ending two decades of exploration.Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day’s most important headlines.

Bahrain’s Foreign Ministry condemned the attack saying the kingdom is calling back home its ambassador Salah Ali al-Maliki for discussions. It added that Iraqi authorities have a responsibility to protect the embassy in Baghdad. The attack on the embassy could affect relations between Iraq and nearby gulf nations at a time when they have been improving in recent months since Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi took office. It was believed to have been carried out by supporters of Iran-backed Iraqi militias. The Iraqi government issued a statement expressing “deep regret” over the attack and vowing to “bring all saboteurs to justice.” The statement said Iraqi security forces took firm measures to force the protesters out of the embassy. Iraq’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Ahmad al-Sahhaf told The Associated Press that Baghdad condemns the attack on the embassy adding that “Iraqi authorities will go after those who took part of the attack as well as the instigators.” No one was hurt in the standoff that lasted more than an hour and later in the night Iraqi security forces were in control of the area. Iraqi troops were deployed around the compound in the late hours of Thursday. An Iraqi security official said the protesters forced their way in by breaking through the main gate but stayed in the garden without storming the offices inside the compound. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations, said security forces opened fire in the air to disperse the protesters and reinforcements were sent to Bagdad’s western neighbourhood of Mansour where the embassy is. More than an hour later, the nearly 200 protesters, waving Iraqi and Palestinian flags, dispersed. Interior Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Saad Maan said protection of diplomatic missions is a “red line.” He added that 54 people have been detained for taking part in the attack. Iraq’s newly named Interior Minister Yasssin al-Yassiri visited the compound around midnight and then held a meeting with the Bahrain ambassador in a safe place outside the embassy. The Bahraini diplomats were evacuated earlier from the compound into the heavily fortified Green Zone that is home to the Iraqi government headquarters, after the mission received threats, the official said. The two-day workshop in Bahrain that ended Wednesday was to promote the Trump administration’s $50 billion economic support plan for the Palestinians ahead of a Mideast peace plan, widely known as the Deal of the Century, to be announced later. Several Arab countries boycotted the Bahrain conference including Lebanon and Iraq as well as the Palestinian authority. Bahraini Foreign Minister Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa was criticized by some Arab and Iranian media outlets for giving an interview to an Israeli TV station in which he said that Palestinians made a mistake by boycotting the workshop. Saudi minister for Gulf affairs Thamer al-Sabhan tweeted that “what is happening now at the Bahraini embassy in Baghdad is very regrettable.” Anwar Gargash, the United Arab Emirates minister of state for foreign affairs, tweeted that the attack on the embassy is “a major escalation on the legal and political levels.” He called on the Iraqi embassy to protect diplomatic missions in Iraq. Iraq is home to Iran-backed militias and the embassy attack comes amid tensions between the United States and Iran in the Middle East. Iraq has close relations with both Washington and Tehran and has been trying to ease tensions between them. The crisis gripping the Middle East stems from President Donald Trump’s withdrawal of the United States a year ago from the nuclear deal between Iran and other world powers and then imposing crippling new sanctions on Tehran.

"458"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-uruguay-withdraws-from-oas-meeting-over-venezuela-opposition/"|"Luis Jaime Acosta"|"Uruguay on Thursday withdrew from a meeting of the Organization of American States (OAS) being held in Medellin, Colombia, in protest of the presence of what it said was an illegitimate delegation from Venezuela. The incident, on the first of two days of meetings, laid bare a lack of consensus in the organization over whether to increase pressure on embattled Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who is backed by some member states but called a dictator by others. Though Venezuela announced its withdrawal from the OAS in April 2017, its political situation has dominated recent assemblies. The country’s opposition, lead by National Assembly head Juan Guaido, appointed Gustavo Tarre as its representative to the body. Guaido in January invoked the constitution to assume a rival interim presidency after rejecting Maduro’s 2018 re-election as illegitimate. Many of the 35 members of the OAS recognize Guaido as the country’s leader. “Uruguay considers this an attempt to impose the recognition of this delegation as legitimate representatives of Venezuela – it is no more and no less than a subjugation of the legality of the OAS,” Uruguay’s vice foreign minister Ariel Bergamino said during the meeting. “There is no other choice but to be against an act of this nature.” “We are withdrawing from this meeting but not from the OAS,” Bergamino added. Mexico said the credentials presented by the opposition delegation did not meet the necessary standards for admittance, while Bolivia said it reserved the right not to recognize resolutions approved while the delegation is present. Several Maduro-supporting Caribbean countries also expressed dismay, while nations including Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay recognized the delegation. The opposition delegation’s presence showed the broad international recognition of Guaido, U.S. OAS representative Kimberly Breir told the assembly. Julio Borges, head of the opposition delegation, said countries which back Maduro do so because his government sells them oil at favourable prices. “Those countries know very well what we have to achieve in Venezuela, very soon – give voice to the Venezuelan people and get Maduro out of power,” he said. Venezuela, home to the world’s largest oil reserves, has remained in political limbo as its economic and humanitarian crises have worsened. Shortages of food and medicine have led some four million Venezuelans to flee. OAS secretary Luis Almagro said on Wednesday the body would seek to increase pressure on Maduro and debate eventual sanctions. Maduro has accused the OAS, which is based in Washington, of being a pawn of the United States.

"459"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-un-puts-brakes-on-peacekeepers-pullout-from-sudans-darfur-2/"|"Edith M. Lederer"|"The U.N. Security Council voted unanimously Thursday to put the brakes on the withdrawal of the joint U.N.-African Union peacekeeping force in Sudan’s vast western Darfur region as the country deals with a political crisis. The council approved a resolution to extend the current mandate of the force, known as UNAMID, for four months until October 31. It asks Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to provide an update in 60 days on the situation on the ground – and it asks the U.N. and AU to make recommendations by Sept. 30 on what the council should do about continuing the withdrawal. Last July, the Security Council voted to dramatically cut the UNAMID force in response to reduced fighting and improved security conditions. The target for ending the mission is June 30, 2020. Britain’s U.N. deputy ambassador Jonathan Allen, whose country co-sponsored the resolution with Germany, said the council made “the responsible decision to pause the withdrawal,” which he said aligns with the decision of the AU Peace and Security Council. “Moreover, it recognizes that Darfur is affected by wider instability in Sudan and that there is a need for continued protection of civilians in Darfur,” he said. Sudan’s military ousted former President Omar al-Bashir from power in April amid mass protests against his 30-year rule. The military has since been locked in a tense standoff with the protest movement demanding civilian rule. Amnesty International said earlier this month that Sudanese security forces have continued to commit “war crimes and other serious human rights violations” in the Darfur region, including the destruction of entire villages, as well as “unlawful killings and sexual violence.” It blamed paramilitary units, the Rapid Support Forces, which grew out of the notorious Janjaweed militias mobilized by al-Bashir during the Darfur conflict which began in 2003 when ethnic Africans rebelled, accusing the Arab-dominated Sudanese government of discrimination. Al-Bashir’s government in Khartoum was accused of retaliating by arming the Janjaweed and unleashing them on civilian populations – a charge the government denied. In recent years, as the result of a successful government military campaign, the rebellion in Darfur has been reduced, leading to the decision to withdraw UNAMID. But Britain’s Allen told the council that “in order to resume the transition from peacekeeping to peace-building, we must see progress.” He singled out the Rapid Support Forces, saying they must withdraw from all former UNAMID team sites so they can be used for civilian purposes, as Sudan’s Transitional Military Council has committed to. “All of this should take place alongside a transition to a legitimate civilian-led government – a government which is accepted by the people of Sudan and therefore the wider international community,” Allen said. Sudan’s U.N. Ambassador Omer Mohamed Ahmed Siddig objected to the pause in UNAMID’s withdrawal. He cited council reports affirming that the situation in Darfur “is constantly improving” and said the government is determined to return Darfur to normal life and move from peacekeeping to peace-building. “For this reason we can see no valid reason for peacekeeping forces to remain in Darfur,” Siddig said.

"460"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-mexico-stages-raid-on-train-detains-dozens-of-migrants-2/"|""|"About 100 Mexican soldiers and immigration agents raided a freight train in the southern state of Chiapas on Thursday and detained dozens of Central American migrants riding atop the cars. Such raids had been rare since the last crackdown on migrants in 2014. But under increasing U.S. pressure to reduce the flow of hundreds of thousands of Central Americans through Mexican territory, Mexico’s government has stepped up enforcement. At least some of the troops wore armbands of Mexico’s newly formed National Guard. The government says it has deployed thousands of Guard agents across the country with supporting immigration enforcement. In a scene filmed by Associated Press journalists, the train rolled to a stop in a rural area, and then soldiers climbed ladders to the top of freight cars shouting, “This is the army, you’re surrounded!” Throngs of migrants sought to flee by running along the tops of freight cars, while others clambered down to the ground and headed into the brush. One soldier was seen wrestling a young, flailing man into a waiting immigration van by the neck. Agents filled three such vehicles with migrants, but hundreds more were apparently able to escape. The train may have been carrying as many as 400 migrants, and Mexico’s Immigration Institute said it detained 40. The most recent such raid occurred May 1 in the state of Oaxaca. Central Americans have been riding freight trains, collectively known as “La Bestia,” or The Beast, for years. Previous raids have served to temporarily discourage migrants from hopping aboard the trains, which is technically prohibited but has long been tolerated. The raid came the same day authorities in the Gulf coast state of Veracruz detained more than 450 migrants in a series of operations, including nearly 260 who were taken into custody in raids on hotels, motels and the main bus station in the city of Veracruz. “We have been making detentions in the entire state,” said Edgar Gonzalez Suarez, the Immigration Institute’s delegate for Veracruz. He called the raids in the Veracruz city “perhaps the biggest operation” to take place there, and said most of the migrants were Hondurans and Guatemalans. Meanwhile 134 migrants were discovered in a crowded tractor-trailer abandoned along a highway elsewhere in Veracruz state, according to a joint statement from several federal agencies. Soldiers and federal police found the trailer Thursday as people were trying to break the locks from inside to get out, it said. Some were found to be in a state of dehydration and had minor injuries. The Immigration Institute determined that 71 of the migrants were minors. It did not give information about nationalities. A photo released by the government showed the container with its back doors open and clothing, food and bundles strewn inside and on the ground. Mexico has said a linchpin of its immigration enforcement efforts is to crack down on human smuggling networks. Earlier this month authorities intercepted four trucks packed with nearly 800 migrants, an uncommonly large number for a single operation although such discoveries are relatively routine.

"461"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-trumps-next-tweet-could-get-a-warning-label-as-twitter-introduces-new/"|"Barbara Ortutay"|"Presidents and other world leaders and political figures who use Twitter to threaten or abuse others could find their tweets slapped with warning labels. The new policy, announced by the company on Thursday, comes amid complaints from activists and others that U.S. President Donald Trump has gotten a free pass from Twitter to post hateful messages and attack his enemies in ways they say could lead to violence. From now on, a tweet that Twitter deems to involve matters of public interest, but which violates the service’s rules, will be obscured by a warning explaining the violation. Users will have to tap through the warning to see the underlying message, but the tweet won’t be removed, as Twitter might do with a regular person’s posts. Twitter said the policy applies to all government officials, candidates and similar public figures with more than 100,000 followers. In addition to applying the label, Twitter won’t use its algorithms to “elevate” or otherwise promote such tweets. “It’s a step in the right direction,” said Keegan Hankes, research analyst for the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Intelligence Project, who focuses on far-right extremist propaganda online. But, he added, Twitter is essentially arguing “that hate speech can be in the public interest. I am arguing that hate speech is never in the public interest.” The new position could fuel additional Trumpian ire toward social media. The President routinely complains, without evidence, that social-media sites are biased against him and other conservatives. Twitter’s rules prohibit threatening violence against a person or group, engaging in “targeted harassment of someone,” or inciting others to do so, such as wishing a person is harmed. It also bans hate speech against a group based on race, ethnicity, gender or other categories. Up to now, the company has exempted prominent leaders from many of those rules, contending that publishing controversial tweets from politicians helps hold them accountable and encourages discussion. But there have been longstanding calls to remove Mr. Trump from the service over what some have called abusive and threatening behaviour. Some activists complained this week after the President threatened Iran with “obliteration” in some areas if it attacks the United States. Mr. Trump has also tweeted a video of himself beating up a man with a CNN logo in place of his head and retweeted seemingly faked anti-Muslim videos. “Donald Trump has changed political discourse on Twitter and everywhere else, given the level of toxic statements he has made about vulnerable communities in America,” Mr. Hankes said. Other politicians could likewise become subject to warning labels. In 2018, French prosecutors filed preliminary charges against far-right French politician Marine Le Pen for tweeting brutal images of Islamic State violence. Twtter prohibits material that is “excessively gory.” And in March, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro stirred outrage by sharing a video on Twitter of a man urinating on the head of another man during a Carnival party. Insults and mockery fall into a grey area. Calling someone a “lowlife, a ”dog“ or a ”stone cold loser,“ as Mr. Trump has done, may not in itself be a violation, but repeated insults against someone might amount to prohibited harassment. Jennifer Grygiel, a social-media expert and professor at Syracuse University, said Twitter “obviously” enacted the new policy because of Trump’s Twitter activity. But Prof. Grygiel said the new rule doesn’t go far enough. Because of the President’s outsize ability to start wars, move stock markets or influence other world events, Twitter should instead review leaders’ tweets before they are sent out and block them if necessary, Prof. Grygiel said. Twitter’s new policy doesn’t apply to past tweets. Twitter said it is still possible for a government official or other figure to tweet something so egregious that it warrants removal. A direct threat of violence against an individual, for instance, would qualify. The company said warning-label decisions will be made by a group that includes members of its trust and safety, legal and public policy teams, as well as employees in the regions where particular tweets originate.

The move by the U.S. Treasury Department freezes any U.S. assets belonging to Nicolas Maduro Jr. and prohibits Americans from doing business with him. “Maduro’s regime was built on fraudulent elections, and his inner circle lives in luxury off the proceeds of corruption while the Venezuelan people suffer,” said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. “Maduro relies on his son, Nicolasito, and others close to his authoritarian regime to maintain a stranglehold on the economy and suppress the people of Venezuela. Treasury will continue to target complicit relatives of illegitimate regime insiders profiting off of Maduro’s corruption.” Until recently, the 29-year-old Mr. Maduro Jr. kept a low profile as a little-known flutist in Venezuela’s world-famous network of youth orchestras. But his political career took off shortly after his father was elected President in 2013 and he was named to lead a newly created corps of inspectors of the presidency, fuelling allegations of nepotism. He’s also a member of the constitutional assembly, a rubber-stamping rival of the opposition-controlled congress charged with rewriting the country’s charter. In 2017, he delivered a fiery speech from the assembly vowing to storm the White House in response to President Donald J. Trump’s threat of military force to remove his father from power. “The rifles would arrive to New York, Mr. Trump. We would arrive and take the White House,” he said. His sanctioning marks the start of a new strategy targeting family members of insiders. A senior U.S. administration official said the Trump administration is considering expanding actions against family members of Maduro officials as part of its focus on corruption by the Socialist leader’s top allies. To date, the Trump administration has sanctioned more than 100 top government officials and other insiders accused of corruption, human-rights violations and drug trafficking, including Mr. Maduro himself and his wife, Cilia Flores. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of a lack of authorization to discuss the matter on the record. The Trump administration has pursued a similar approach to the children of businessmen close to Russian President Vladimir Putin – so-called second generation oligarchs – as well the kin of leaders from the designated terrorist group Hezbollah. Mr. Maduro Jr., who closely resembles his father and is known almost universally as “Nicolasito” – or “Little Nicolas” – is also a leader in the ruling Socialist party’s youth wing and previously was co-ordinator of the government-run film school, despite having no known previous experience in cinema. According to the U.S. Treasury Department, Mr. Maduro Jr. has also been involved in propaganda and censorship effort and has profited from Venezuelan mines along with Mr. Maduro and Ms. Flores. The Treasury also alleges that he helped devise a strategy this year to put pressure on Venezuela’s military to deny humanitarian aid from entering the country by characterizing it as an attempt to undermine democracy. He also allegedly worked to increase censorship of Venezuela’s telecommunications infrastructure, framing the censorship as necessary because of U.S. Government activities. There was no immediate response from Mr. Maduro Jr., his father or any other government official.

Several people have died around the continent in incidents that authorities are linking to the weather. A major wildfire raged on Friday in Spain, sparked when a pile of chicken dung spontaneously combusted in the heat. Several countries have reported record temperatures this week and France hit its all-time heat record on Friday: 45.9 C in the small southern town of Gallargues-le-Montueux, according to French media. The French national weather service activated its highest-level heat danger alert for the first time, putting four regions around Marseille and Montpellier in the south of the country under special watch on Friday. About 4,000 schools were closed because they couldn’t ensure safe conditions. Local authorities cancelled several cultural and sport events and many end-of-school-year carnivals. City halls were also sending volunteers to visit elderly people at home to ensure they had fans and water. In Issy-les-Moulineaux, a southwestern Paris suburb, Jean-Jacques Emerjian, 87, and his wife Marie-France, 80 were relieved to see the Red Cross volunteers. Ms. Emerjian said “with my handicapped husband, I am worried because I don’t have someone who can come right away [to help]. He fell the other night and I couldn’t get him up and I was scared. He had a malaise, he fainted.” In the northern Paris suburb of Saint-Denis, the Salvation Army day centre, which allows migrants living in the streets to take showers, also provided them with lots of bottled water. Paris city hall estimates about 1,000 to 2,000 migrants currently live in makeshift camps, which are particularly exposed to the heat. Some criticized the government for going overboard, but Prime Minister Édouard Philippe defended the efforts after 15,000 people died in a heat wave in 2003 that woke up France to the risks. “This heat wave is exceptional by its intensity and its earliness,” he told reporters. “Measures have been taken for the most vulnerable people,” he said. “But given the intensity of the heat wave, it’s the entire population who must be careful today … both for oneself and for loved ones and neighbours.” Italy put 16 cities under alerts for high temperatures and civil-security services distributed water to tourists visiting famed sites around Rome under a scorching sun. Heat was blamed for the deaths of two people in Spain, private news agency Europa Press reported on Friday. An 80-year-old man collapsed and died in the street in Valladolid, in northwestern Spain, the agency said, and a 17-year-old boy died in the southern city of Cordoba after diving into a swimming pool and losing consciousness. Four people have drowned so far in France this week and a 12-year-old girl drowned in a river near Manchester, England. France’s Health Minister and British police warned people to swim only in authorized areas. France has also seen an uptick in so-called street-pooling, or illegally opening fire hydrants. A six-year-old child is in life-threatening condition after being hit by water shooting from a cracked-open fire hydrant in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis, broadcaster France-Info reported. More than 200 firefighters dealt with dozens of fires in the Gard region, in southeastern France, and a highway was closed for safety reasons. More than 600 firefighters and six water-dropping aircraft were battling the worst fire in two decades in the Catalonia region on Friday, as Spain is forecast to endure the peak of its heat wave, with temperatures expected to exceed 40 C. In Berlin, a police unit turned water cannons – usually used against rioters – on city trees, to cool them down. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said on Friday temperature records for this time of year have been broken in Germany, France, Spain, Switzerland and Austria. Speaking in Geneva, WMO spokeswoman Clare Nullis said Earth is set to experience its five warmest years on record from 2015 to 2019. The WMO says that increasing greenhouse gas concentrations will fuel global heat and climate change. “It’s hitting the poorest and most vulnerable, but it will ultimately hit everybody,” Ms. Nullis said. In Paris, near the presidential palace, about 100 students organized a street protest to urge authorities to take immediate action on climate change. The action ended without police violence. French President Emmanuel Macron presents himself as a champion of fighting climate change, but environmental organizations say France doesn’t do enough to limit the impact of global warming. The heat wave is caused by warm air rising across Europe from North Africa. Hot temperatures are expected to last until Sunday, when a cold front will arrive on the continent.

James Alex Fields Jr. of Maumee, Ohio, had pleaded guilty in March to the attack that killed one person and injured more than two dozen others. In exchange, prosecutors dropped their request for the death penalty. Defence lawyers asked for a sentence less than life. He will be sentenced next month on separate state charges. Before the judge handed down his sentence, Mr. Fields, accompanied by one of his lawyers, walked to a podium in the courtroom and spoke. “I apologize for the hurt and loss I’ve caused,” he said, later adding, “Every day I think about how things could have gone differently and how I regret my actions. I’m sorry.” Mr. Fields’s comment came after more than a dozen survivors of and witnesses to the attack delivered emotional testimony about the physical and psychological wounds they had received as a result of the events that day. The “Unite the Right” rally on Aug. 12, 2017, drew hundreds of white nationalists to Charlottesville to protest the planned removal of a statue of Confederate Civil War general Robert E. Lee. The case stirred racial tensions around the United States. Mr. Fields faced with 29 hate-crime charges and one count of “racially motivated violent interference.” He pleaded guilty to 29 of the counts. In a sentencing memo filed in court last week, Mr. Fields’s lawyers asked U.S. District Judge Michael Urbanski to consider a sentence of “less than life.” “No amount of punishment imposed on James can repair the damage he caused to dozens of innocent people. But this Court should find that retribution has limits,” his attorneys wrote. Mr. Fields faces sentencing in state court on July 15. A jury has recommended life plus 419 years.

"465"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-iran-meets-with-nuclear-deal-partners-as-growing-uranium-stockpiles/"|"John Irish Francois Murphy"|"European countries offered too little at last-ditch talks on Friday to persuade Iran to back off from its plans to breach limits imposed by its nuclear agreement with world powers, Iran’s envoy said. A week after Washington abruptly called off air strikes on Iran, diplomats say Tehran is days away from exceeding the maximum amount of enriched uranium allowed under its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which Washington quit last year. The countries that are still parties to the agreement – European powers Britain, Germany and France plus Russia and China – held urgent talks with Iranian officials on Friday in Vienna in hopes of persuading Tehran to hold off. The Europeans say breach of the agreement by Iran would escalate confrontation at a time when Tehran and Washington are at risk of a miscalculation that could trigger a war. Iran’s envoy, deputy foreign minister Abbas Araqchi, said the talks were “a step forward, but it is still not enough and not meeting Iran’s expectations.” He said it was ultimately up to his superiors in Tehran to decide whether to call off plans to exceed limits in the nuclear deal, but he did not believe the talks’ outcome was likely to change their minds. “The decision to reduce our commitments has already been made and we will continue unless our expectations are met,” he said. “I don’t think the progress made today will be enough to stop our process, but the decision will be made in Tehran.” The likelihood Iran could exceed the deal’s limits as soon as the next few days is the next looming worry for European leaders trying to keep confrontation between Washington and Tehran from spiralling out of control. Despite abandoning the deal, Washington has demanded European countries ensure Iran comply with it. Iran says it cannot do so unless the Europeans provide it with some way to receive the deal’s promised economic benefits. In particular, it wants its oil exports restored to the level of April, 2018, before U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned the deal and reimposed sanctions. French President Emmanuel Macron said this week he would ask Mr. Trump to ease sanctions to allow negotiations to begin. But the plea seemed to have fallen on deaf ears, with Mr. Trump’s Iran envoy saying on Friday sanctions would remain in place to end Iranian oil exports altogether. China, long a big importer of Iranian oil, said it rejected U.S. sanctions, but Fu Cong, director-general of the department of arms control of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, would not be drawn on whether Beijing planned to keep buying. So far, European proposals to protect Iran from the impact of U.S. sanctions have failed, with Iran largely shunned in international oil markets and all major companies cancelling plans to invest there for fear of falling afoul of U.S. rules. After Friday’s talks, Mr. Araqchi said he had been informed the Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges (InSTEx), a new barter mechanism set up by the Europeans to facilitate some trade with Iran, was now operational. Britain, France and Germany have informed the EU that InSTEx “had been made operational … and that the first transactions are being processed,” the EU said in a statement. However, a European diplomat said while the system was working on the European side and transactions had been identified, work on the Iranian end had yet to be completed. Mr. Araqchi said the new mechanism would help only if it enables Iran to sell its oil. The Europeans say it is likely to be able to handle only small transactions for items such as medicine, already permitted under sanctions. Iran has said it is increasing its nuclear program and has announced dates when this would push it past limits in the deal. The first big deadline passed on Thursday, the day Tehran said it would accumulate more enriched uranium than the deal allows. Diplomats who follow the work of UN inspectors said their data suggested Iran had not breached the limit on Thursday, but was on course to do so over the weekend. Another deadline falls on July 7, when Iran says it will have enriched some uranium to a purity forbidden under the deal. Tehran says it still aims to keep the deal alive and any breaches could be reversed. The crisis between Iran and the United States that began with Mr. Trump’s withdrawal from the pact has escalated in recent weeks after Washington sharply tightened its sanctions from the start of May to halt all Iranian oil exports. The Trump administration argues the 2015 agreement reached under his predecessor Barack Obama was too weak because many terms are temporary and it excludes non-nuclear issues such as missiles and Iran’s regional behaviour. Washington says the aim of sanctions is to force Tehran to renegotiate. Tehran says there can be no talks as long as sanctions are in place and Washington is ignoring the deal it already struck. The confrontation took on a military dimension in recent weeks, with Washington blaming Tehran for attacks on ships in the Gulf, which Iran denies. Iran shot down a U.S. drone last week, saying it had entered its air space. Washington said the drone was in international skies and Mr. Trump ordered, then aborted, retaliatory air strikes on Iranian targets. Any move by Iran that violated the nuclear deal would put pressure on the Europeans to take sides. “We want them to stay in the accord, but we won’t accept them messing us around,” a senior European diplomat said.

"466"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-huaweis-ceo-has-a-message-for-canada-join-us-and-prosper-in-the-5g/"|"Nathan VanderKlippe"|"Fourteen months before his daughter was arrested at the airport in Vancouver, one of China’s most prominent billionaires came to Canada. Ren Zhengfei came looking for smart people and places to spend money, criss-crossing the country with stops in Montreal, Ottawa and Toronto before boarding the Rocky Mountaineer from Banff to Kamloops, then on to Vancouver. “It was a 10-plus day trip from east to west,” he told The Globe and Mail this week in a wide-ranging discussion at the company’s headquarters in Shenzhen, part of a concerted effort to use his own genial personality to assuage fears that his company is an untrustworthy threat, an agent of an authoritarian regime seeking to disrupt the global order. The Canadian excursion, though, hearkened back to the days, decades earlier, when Mr. Ren piled executives into a van and roamed the United States, hoping to glean secrets of American innovation that would help propel Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., the company he founded, into a globe-spanning giant of technology. This time, though, he was driven by visions of Canada as a new foundation for Huawei’s future. He liked what he saw: a country with an American standard of living but a more open immigration policy. He was impressed by the Canadian universities he visited and the people he met, including two researchers he calls fathers of artificial intelligence. Today he is critical of Canada, saying a smarter country would have ignored the U.S. request to extradite his daughter, Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou. But in 2017 he left Canada determined to spend billions of dollars and hire thousands of people. “I’ve already told the head of our local management team in Canada that we will buy a lot of land in places like Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal and Vancouver, and use that land to build new research and development centres,” he told The Globe, revealing the outlines of a plan to broaden Huawei’s imprint on Canadian soil, where it already employs about a thousand people. Canada stands to “become Huawei’s global centre for theoretical research,” he said, recruiting scientists from around the world to puzzle through the complex questions that may define which technology companies stand and fall for years to come. ”Over the next several decades,” Mr. Ren said, “I think the biggest revolution for humanity will come from artificial intelligence and bioscience.” He was speaking almost seven months after Ms. Meng’s arrest, an act of law enforcement that precipitated a political, economic and human crisis rarely matched in recent Canadian history. Ms. Meng has been charged in the United States with bank fraud, wire fraud and conspiracies to commit bank and wire fraud. But as she awaits an extradition hearing in Vancouver, it is Canada that has borne the brunt of Chinese anger. China has taken prisoner two Canadian citizens and inflicted deepening economic pain – blocking imports of Canadian canola and meat. In Ottawa, political infighting has renewed questions about the basic fabric of the country – and the values that underpin Canada. Mr. Ren says he is determined to build new research and development centres in Canada all the same – though he admits the project’s pace has slowed – making even more acute the questions for Canadian leaders as they contemplate what role to allow Huawei to play in the country, especially in the building of 5G mobile network technology. The land has yet to be bought. But for Huawei, “our strategy to continue to develop and invest in Canada remains unchanged,” Mr. Ren said. That is, if it’s welcome.     Few people occupy a more central role in the continuing crisis than Mr. Ren, who stewarded Huawei into a Chinese-headquartered colossus that has come to represent China’s fast-changing place in the world, as well as the fears – of espionage, of intellectual-property theft, of a new authoritarian regime building digital tools that can challenge Western liberalism – that accompany it. Mr. Ren was once a mysterious figure, a Communist Party member and former People’s Liberation Army technologist who gained fame as an entrepreneur but shunned the public spotlight, describing himself as shy. But in the months since Ms. Meng’s arrest, he has taken on a far more visible presence. He is folksy and warm in person, choosing his words deliberately and peppering them with so many idioms that his interpreters come prepared with a full page of translations. Occasionally bursting into laughter, he is an unintimidating presence at odds with the image of Huawei as a predatory tool of the Chinese government. Though he is careful to speak on behalf of himself and his company alone, he is often seen as giving voice to a rising superpower as it confronts a sometimes unreceptive outside world. In an interview that spanned almost two hours, Mr. Ren, 75, sharply rebuked Canada’s leaders, saying it had been foolish not to rebuff the U.S. request to extradite Ms. Meng. “Maybe some other countries are smarter in rejecting U.S. extradition requests,” he said. Mr. Ren, who only learned of his daughter’s arrest two days after it took place, urged Canada’s Justice Minister, David Lametti, to use his power to intervene and free Ms. Meng. Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland has rejected the idea. But failing to do so, Mr. Ren said, would send the message that Canada is subservient to the United States, and “Canada’s image might be harmed.” But he did side with Ottawa on one matter: China and Canada should be talking. “Dialogue is important,” he said. Beijing has ignored numerous requests to speak with Canadian leaders since Ms. Meng’s arrest. He also offered Huawei’s help, of a sort, in seeking the release of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, the former diplomat and the entrepreneur arrested for allegedly stealing Chinese state secrets, in what is widely seen as retribution and a form of “hostage diplomacy.” If Canada is prepared to initiate an exchange – freeing Ms. Meng – “we will start our part of the work,” Mr. Ren said, suggesting Huawei might then advocate for the release of the two Canadians. But, he said, in a reference to Ottawa, “I don’t think you are prepared for such an exchange.”   Mr. Ren spoke from the marbled interior of a newly opened client-reception building on Huawei’s main campus in Shenzhen, a three-storey building filled with hand-painted reproductions of historic Russian paintings, window panes fashioned into the shape of the Huawei logo and rooms designed to mimic Japanese tea houses and an Italian café. Outside, water burbles down an artificial river next to grass manicured to a putting-green standard, a peaceful idyll. It’s a rare bit of serenity in a company known for its punishing 996 work culture, which has many employees working 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week. A “cot culture” of sleeping in the office dates to the company’s earliest days, as does a militaristic ethos espoused by Mr. Ren. Finding itself at war with the United States has only strengthened that resolve, and Mr. Ren has taken on the air of a greying general whose grandfatherly mien has done nothing to dull his readiness for a fight. Indeed, age seems only to have strengthened his resolve, as he described an intense effort to vanquish what is almost certainly the greatest foe he has ever faced, the might of the U.S. government, which in mid-May placed Huawei on the Entity List, a blacklist that bars the company from acquiring U.S. technology or parts without specific permission. The list has been dubbed the “death penalty” for any corporation, and last week Mr. Ren warned that being blacklisted by the United States could slash the company’s revenue by US$30-billion this year. Now, however, he says that estimate is already too pessimistic. “This was our initial projection, but the actual numbers in our financial statements were a little higher than expected,” he said. In what has now become a famous piece of modern soothsaying, Mr. Ren has long devoted engineers and programmers to a Plan B, tasking them with building their own technology and software in case of an unforeseen disruption. “We have long been prepared,” he said. Huawei currently sits in a sort of blacklist purgatory. Days after adding the company to the Entity List, the Trump administration granted it a 90-day reprieve, and many of its suppliers have applied for exemptions that would allow them to continue working with the Chinese firm. Yet Mr. Ren has little hope. “I don’t think the U.S. will remove us from the Entity List,” he said. “They have added Huawei to the list not because we have done something wrong and need to be punished, but because they want to wipe us out. If someone wants to condemn you, they can always trump up a charge.” And Huawei has no shortage of problems to confront as it tries to shake its reliance on the United States. The biggest problems, Mr. Ren said, lie in unexpected areas. “If some small, apparently minor component is missing on your circuit board, you may have to redesign the entire board,” he said. “And that involves quite a workload.” Problems are likely to emerge, including shortages of some products. The next year and a half won’t be easy for a company that has relied heavily on the U.S. from its earliest days. When Mr. Ren first travelled to the United States in 1992 with a small group of executives, he visited the headquarters of Texas Instruments as well as Silicon Valley, which stirred in him an intoxicating ambition: to catch up with the U.S. More than a third of the companies Huawei listed last year as core suppliers are American. Staff say Mr. Ren’s favoured coffee brew remains the Americano – or, as it is rendered into Mandarin, “American style.” “We never want to live without U.S. technology or the support provided by their products and components,” he said. But when it comes to turning his back on the country that once inspired him, he intimates that he no longer feels he has a choice. While his own beverage tastes are unlikely to change, the internal directive to Huawei workers is clear: Strip out anything from the U.S. across the company’s sprawling product lines. Within two years, Mr. Ren said, “we will no longer face a threat to our survival.”     It may be bluster. Mr. Ren’s ambition to overtake the United States has landed his company on death’s doorstep before. Upon his return from his U.S. road trip in 1992, he began spending heavily to gain an edge on U.S. rivals. The following year, amid a national lending crackdown, a series of banks froze out Huawei, and the company ran into cash-flow trouble. Mr. Ren brought in government-backed funding at punishing 33-per-cent repayment rates. It took years for Huawei to return to health. But in the decades since, it has grown into a far more potent entity. Its current payroll includes more than 80,000 people in research and development roles, and the company has grown by 6,000 people this year as it works to weed out U.S. technology. With that much talent at his disposal, Mr. Ren does not see “the U.S. posing a substantial risk that threatens Huawei.” One of his primary tasks, however, remains convincing the rest of the world that Huawei is not a threat. The company has been placed under intense global scrutiny, accused by Western scholars and politicians of running a Potemkin employee ownership scheme and labelled a security threat by those who doubt that any company in China could grow to Huawei’s size and stature without the ministrations, if not the outright control, of the Chinese state. The company has denied all of the allegations against it, claiming – improbably, observers say – that it would reject government demands to spy on its overseas customers. Yet questions continue to mount. This week, a Bloomberg report uncovered 10 academic articles co-authored by Huawei employees and Chinese military researchers, a seeming contradiction of earlier assurances from Mr. Ren that Huawei does no such joint research. “Huawei was not aware of the behaviour of these several individuals in their individual capacity. We have no idea why they did this,” he told The Globe. Only one of the employees in question continues to work for the company, in an entry-level position, he said. He accused his employees of co-operating with the military “to hog the limelight. He must think that people would pay attention to him. It’s like being an internet celebrity.” Only after several questions did he say that such co-operation was “not allowed” at Huawei. The company has also rejected repeated allegations that its success is built on stolen technology. On Thursday, chief legal officer Song Liuping said that “in the past 30 years, no court has ever concluded that Huawei engaged in malicious intellectual-property theft. And we have never been required by the court to pay damages for this.” Those words, however, were carefully chosen: Courts have on multiple occasions found that Huawei breached contracts and misappropriated and stole trade secrets – the most recent such ruling came this week – and the company has been ordered to pay millions of dollars in damages, although not for theft considered “malicious.” Now, however, the company is striking out on a new effort to depict others as intellectual-property scofflaws as well. Huawei has demanded US$1-billion in payments for five years of unpaid patent licensing fees from Verizon Communications Inc., Mr. Ren said, and “extra money will be charged for 5G.” Verizon is unlikely to be the only company to receive such a demand. Huawei is striking out on a worldwide effort to collect money it feels it is owed. “Companies who may not have a big patent portfolio may have to pay more in the future,” Mr. Ren said.   But to those who co-operate with Huawei, he pledges benefits. Indeed, when it comes to Canada, he offers a pitch that would not sound out of place in a stump speech, were any politician willing to make Huawei a centrepiece of future plans. He starts from history: Europe industrialized more quickly than China, he said, in part because its infrastructure ran faster. In an era when Europe had trains, China still used horse-drawn carriages. “Speed is very important to the development of a society,” he said, arguing that the same is true for information. “5G is a very high-speed product that will play a very important role in boosting the development of culture, education and the economy,” he said. The U.S., for its part, “can’t set up an advanced information system," he said, “because we will not be selling our products in the United States.” He suggests Ottawa has a chance to link arms with Huawei to leapfrog Washington – to transformational effect. “The biggest weakness for Canada is that while you have very bright people, you don’t have enough people,” he said. But high-speed networks can enable a broader deployment of artificial intelligence of the sort that, the optimists believe, can expand human productivity tenfold. Do that, Mr. Ren suggested, and Canada “will become an industrial power with an equivalent population of 300 million.” Install 5G, in other words – and Mr. Ren has his own system to sell – and “it’s very likely investors from other parts of the world would swarm to Canada.”  Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day’s most important headlines.

People from New York and afar came to take photos and share in the legacy of the gay bar where patrons resisted a police raid, sparking protests and longer-term organizing that made the cause considerably more visible. “Fifty years ago, people stood up for their rights, and look where we’re at now. We’ve got flags all over the city,” said Richard Walker, 58, an airline worker from New York. “I’m getting goosebumps just really thinking about it.” With the modern incarnation of the Stonewall Inn as the focal point, the day’s celebrations included music, speeches and an evening rally. Lady Gaga, Whoopi Goldberg, Alicia Keys, drag performers and other artists at the advocacy organization Pride Live’s Stonewall Day Concert addressed a crowd that stretched for blocks on a nearly 90-degree afternoon. “This community has fought and continued to fight a war of acceptance, a war of tolerance,” Lady Gaga said. “You are the definition of courage.” Robert Beaird travelled from Dallas to attend the Stonewall anniversary events a couple of years after coming out in his 50s. “I just kind of hid who I was for my whole life, and then within the last two years, I’ve been going through this kind of cathartic experience of accepting myself,” said Mr. Beaird, 53, who had been married and fathered children. “Just to be here with all these people is pretty amazing.” Jocelyn Burrell isn’t gay, but she made her way to the Stonewall Inn because she was struck by how welcoming it was when she stopped in there years ago, and she feels a sense of common cause with its place in history. “Just like we fought – black people fought – for civil rights, I feel I should support other people who fight for civil rights,” she said. On Friday evening, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio joined a grassroots rally in front of Stonewall Inn, saying “Happy Pride, everybody!” to thousands of cheering people including activists, organizers and politicians. The Democratic mayor called those who were arrested in 1969 “brave,” setting the stage for future LGBTQ rights. In the crowd was Emma Gonzalez, who survived last year’s high school massacre in Parkland, Florida, and is a bisexual gun-control advocate. Also there was Barbara Poma, owner of the Pulse gay nightclub in Coral Springs, Florida, the scene of one of the worst mass shootings in U.S. history. Friday’s events were kicking off a big weekend of Pride festivities in New York and elsewhere. In New York, Sunday’s huge WorldPride parade – and an alternative march intended as a less corporate commemoration of Stonewall – also will swing past the bar. Cities around the world began celebrating Pride on Friday. Participants in a march in the Philippines went by the presidential palace in Manila, waving placards as they marked the 25th year since the first such gathering. The Stonewall Inn is now a landmark and part of the Stonewall National Monument, but in 1969, it was part of a gay scene that was known, yet not open. At the time, showing same-sex affection or dressing in a way deemed gender-inappropriate could get people arrested, and bars had lost liquor licenses for serving LGBTQ customers. The police raid on the bar began early the morning of June 28, 1969. The nightspot was unlicensed, and the officers had been assigned to stop any illegal alcohol sales. Patrons and people who converged on the bar on Christopher Street resisted, hurling objects and at points scuffling with the officers. Protests followed over several more days. A year later, LGBTQ New Yorkers marked the anniversary of the riot with the Christopher Street Liberation Day March. Thousands proudly paraded through a city where, at the time, LGBTQ people were largely expected to stay in the shadows. The Stonewall Inn itself closed not long after the raid. The current Stonewall Inn dates to the early 1990s. “We understand we’re the innkeepers of history,” co-owner Stacy Lentz said. “We really feel like the fire that started at Stonewall in 1969 is not done. The battleground has just shifted.” Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day’s most important headlines. Sign up today.

The dispute has already cost companies in both countries billions of dollars, disrupted global manufacturing and supply lines, and roiled markets. “The U.S. side said it would not add new tariffs on Chinese exports,” Xinhua said in a brief report, adding that negotiators of both countries would discuss specific issues, but gave no details. Trump told reporters he had an excellent meeting with the Chinese leader and that talks were “back on track.” The two met in Japan’s western city of Osaka, on the sidelines of a summit of leaders of Group of 20 (G20) developed economies. “We had a very good meeting with President Xi of China, excellent, I would say excellent, as good as it was going to be,” Trump said. “We discussed a lot of things and we’re right back on track and we’ll see what happens.” Ahead of the talks, Trump had said a fair trade deal would be “historic,” but gave no details. The trade dispute, which includes a feud over Huawei Technologies Co has fanned fears it could threaten global growth. “The trade relations between China and the United States are difficult, they are contributing to the slowdown of the global economy,” European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said on Friday, the summit’s first day. The U.S. president has said he would extend existing tariffs to cover almost all imports from China into the United States if the meeting brought no progress on wide-ranging U.S. demands for economic reforms. At the start of Saturday’s talks, Xi told Trump he was ready to exchange views on fundamental issues and stressed the need for dialog rather than confrontation. “Cooperation and dialog are better than friction and confrontation,” he said. The G20 leaders will agree on Saturday to accelerate reforms of the World Trade Organization, but stop short of calling for the need to resist protectionism in their closing communique, Japan’s Nikkei newspaper said. The United States says China has been stealing U.S. intellectual property for years, forces U.S. firms to share trade secrets as a condition for doing business in China, and subsidizes state-owned firms to dominate industries. China has said the United States is making unreasonable demands and must also make concessions. The dispute escalated when talks collapsed in May after Washington accused Beijing of reneging on reform pledges. Trump raised tariffs to 25% from 10% on $200 billion of Chinese goods, and China retaliated with levies on U.S. imports. As ties have soured, the dispute has spread beyond trade. The U.S. administration has declared Chinese telecoms giant Huawei a security threat, effectively banning U.S. companies from doing business with it. U.S. officials have also pressed other governments to drop Huawei from plans to develop fifth generation, or 5G, networks. Trump has suggested easing U.S. restrictions on Huawei could be a factor in a trade deal with Xi. China has demanded the U.S. drop the curbs, saying Huawei presents no security threat.

Detective Luis Alvarez’s death from cancer was announced by Chief of Detectives Dermot Shea, who tweeted that Alvarez was “an inspiration, a warrior, a friend.” Alvarez appeared with former Daily Show host Jon Stewart earlier this month to plead with Congress to extend the compensation fund. “This fund isn’t a ticket to paradise, it’s to provide our families with care,” a frail Alvarez told a House Judiciary subcommittee on June 11. He added, “You all said you would never forget. Well, I’m here to make sure that you don’t.” Alvarez was admitted to a hospice in Rockville Centre on Long Island within a few days of his testimony. The bill to replenish the compensation fund that provides health benefits to police officers, firefighters and others who responded to the 2001 terrorist attacks passed the full committee unanimously. Alvarez’s survivors include his wife, his three sons, his parents and three siblings. The family said in a Facebook post that Alvarez touched many lives by sharing his battle with cancer. “Thank you for giving us this time we have had with him, it was a blessing,” the post said. Alvarez was diagnosed with colorectal cancer in 2016. He traced his illness to the three months he spent in the rubble of the World Trade Center’s twin towers after the 2001 terrorist attacks. About 1 in 22 men and 1 in 24 women will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer during their lifetime, according to the American Cancer Society. It is expected to kill 51,000 people in the U.S. this year, making it the second most common type of fatal cancer.

Thursday’s accident at the Kamoto Copper Company (KCC) concession near Democratic Republic of Congo’s southern border with Zambia has focused attention on the dangers run by informal miners, who burrow dozens of metres below ground in search of ore using rudimentary tools. Glencore estimates that some 2,000 diggers enter KCC property each day. Tens of thousands more work in and around other major mines across Congo’s copperbelt. “From tomorrow, if you come back here, you won’t see any more clandestines,” Interior Minister Basile Olongo told reporters on Saturday at the mine. “We are going to take measures to evacuate everyone.” Mr. Olongo did not say how the government planned to make the miners leave. The governor of Lualaba province, where the mine is located, told Reuters on Friday that the army would be deployed to KCC to deter miners from entering. A Glencore spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. Last week, Congo’s army sent hundreds of troops to the nearby Tenke mine, which is owned by China Molybdenum Co Ltd in response to the presence of as many as 10,000 informal miners there. Those moves have alarmed human rights activists, who fear they will lead to violent clashes and abuses. The activists also say that security responses ignore the underlying factors that push people to the mines, namely poverty and unemployment. Despite boasting rich reserves of copper, cobalt, gold, diamonds and tin, Congo is one of the world’s least developed countries, due largely to corruption and misgovernment. In his remarks, Mr. Olongo criticized the miners who lost their lives. “It’s sad. It is true that we have lost our compatriots, but which compatriots?” he said. “We have lost thieves who came to steal ore.” Mr. Olongo also said the authorities were working to find alternative sites where the miners could work. However, previous initiatives to do so have not been sufficient to absorb a significant amount of miners.

In the Gard region, where France’s highest temperature on record was registered on Friday at 45.9 degrees Celsius, scores of fires burned some about 1,500 acres of land and destroyed several houses and vehicles, emergency services said. More than 700 firefighters and 10 aircraft were mobilised to tackle the fires in the Gard, some of which caused sections of motorways to be temporarily closed. Several firefighters were hurt but no serious injuries were reported. French media said a man had been arrested for deliberately starting fires in one Gard village. The extreme heat was expected to ease on Saturday in southern France but highs were still forecast at close to 40 degrees. Further north, Paris was due to experience its hottest day of the heatwave so far with a predicted high of 37 degrees. Authorities in the capital maintained a ban on driving older cars to curb heatwave-related pollution. The World Meteorological Organization said this week that 2019 was on track to be among the world’s hottest years, and 2015-2019 would then be the hottest five-year period on record. It said the European heatwave was “absolutely consistent” with extremes linked to the impact of greenhouse gas emissions. Britain could see its hottest day of the year so far on Saturday, with temperatures expected to reach up to 35 degrees, according to the Met Office. For a fourth consecutive day, unusually high temperatures above 43 degrees were forecast on Saturday across Spain. Forty of the Spain’s 50 regions have been placed under weather alert, with seven of them considered to be at extreme risk, the national meteorological agency said. In the northeastern city of Girona, the mercury reached a record high of 43.9 degrees on Friday, the Catalan city’s highest-ever temperature on record. Firefighters managed to contain 90 per cent of the wildfires that raged across 60 sq km of land in the northeastern Tarragona province, the Catalan government said on Saturday. Two other wildfires in the central Toledo region were still burning, officials said. The heat killed at least three people as temperatures soared in central and northern Italy, while hospitals in the financial capital Milan saw a 35 per cent rise in emergency visits due to heat-related conditions, local media reported. Demand for power in the city surged as people cranked up air conditioning causing sporadic blackouts in stores and restaurants.

The world’s two largest economies are in the midst of a bitter trade war, which has seen them level increasingly severe tariffs on each other’s imports. In a sign of significant progress in relations on Saturday, Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump, on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Osaka, agreed to a ceasefire and a return to talks. However, the official China Daily, an English-language daily often used by Beijing to put its message out to the rest of the world, warned while there was now a greater likelihood of reaching an agreement, there’s no guarantee there would be one. “Even though Washington agreed to postpone levying additional tariffs on Chinese goods to make way for negotiations, and Trump even hinted at putting off decisions on Huawei until the end of negotiations, things are still very much up in the air,” it said in an editorial late Saturday. “Agreement on 90 per cent of the issues has proved not to be enough, and with the remaining 10 per cent where their fundamental differences reside, it is not going to be easy to reach a 100-per cent consensus, since at this point, they remain widely apart even on the conceptual level.” Trump also offered an olive branch to Xi on Huawei Technologies Co, the world’s biggest telecom network equipment maker. The Trump administration has said the Chinese firm poses a national security risk given its close ties to China’s government, and has lobbied U.S. allies to keep Huawei out of next-generation 5G telecommunications infrastructure. The Chinese government’s top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, in a lengthy statement about G20 released by the Foreign Ministry following the delegation’s return to Beijing, said the Xi-Trump meeting had sent a “positive signal” to the world. Though problems between the two countries remain, China is confident as long as they both follow the consensus reached by their leaders they can resolve their problems on the basis of mutual respect, Wang said in the statement released late Saturday. Trump’s comments on Huawei, made at a more than hour-long news conference in Osaka following his sit-down with Xi, generated only a cautious welcome from China. The word “Huawei” was not mentioned at all in the top diplomat’s appraisal of G20. Wang Xiaolong, the Foreign Ministry’s special envoy of G20 affairs and head of the ministry’s Department of International Economic Affairs, said if the United States does what it says on Huawei then China would of course welcome it. “To put restrictions in areas that go beyond technology and economic factors will definitely lead to a lose-lose situation. So if the U.S. side can do what it says then we will certainly welcome that,” Wang told reporters. The pause in tensions is likely to be welcomed by the business community, and markets, which have swooned on both sides of the Pacific due to the trade war. Jacob Parker, vice-president of China operations at the U.S.-China Business Council, said returning to talks was good news for the business community and added much needed certainty to “a slowly deteriorating relationship”. “Now comes the hard work of finding consensus on the most difficult issues in the relationship, but with a commitment from the top we’re hopeful this will put the two sides on a sustained path to resolution.” China’s position as the trade war has progressed has become increasingly strident, saying it would not be bullied, would not give in to pressure, and that it would “fight to the end”. Taoran Notes, an influential WeChat account run by China’s Economic Daily, said the United States was now aware that China was not going to give in, and that tariffs on Chinese goods were increasingly unpopular back home. “We’ve said it before – communication and friction between China and the United States is a long-term, difficult and complex thing. Fighting then talking, fighting then talking, is the normal state of affairs,” it said.

The broadcaster’s Blue Planet II documentary, which has been shown in countries around the world, highlighted the dangers of plastic pollution to marine life and the 93-year-old said the move at the world’s largest greenfield festival would have an impact. “That is more than 1 million bottles of water that have not been drunk by you in plastic,” he said to cheers and applause. “Thank you, thank you”. Growing calls for action by the public in part prompted around 180 countries to agree last month to sharply reduce the amount of plastic that gets washed into the world’s oceans, the United Nations said. Glastonbury has banned the sale of water, soft drinks and alcohol in plastic bottles this year. In 2017, the last time the event was held, more than 1 million single-used plastic bottles were sold on site. Festivals goers were encouraged to bring their own bottles or buy steel flasks that could be filled with water at taps and water kiosks around the site. Some queues built up at water refill sites in soaring temperatures on Friday and Saturday, but there were few complaints amongst the about 200,000 people on site. “We’ve never once not been able to fill up, and it’s lovely ice-cold water – so what else would you want?” said Amanda Hawkins from Bristol. “So – no problem at all.” Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day’s most important headlines.

"476"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-johnson-hunt-vow-to-splash-the-cash-in-race-for-britains-next-pm/"|"Kate Holton"|"Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt vowed to spend billions of pounds on public services, infrastructure and tax cuts on Sunday as the two men battling to become prime minister pitched themselves as the best candidate to take on the opposition Labour Party. The rivals to succeed Theresa May as leader of the ruling Conservative Party sought to win broader backing by setting out plans to invest in education, transport and defence, even at the cost of higher government borrowing. The race should be over by July 23. Johnson, the favourite, vowed to increase spending on education, adding to earlier pledges to invest in transport, superfast broadband, more police and tax cuts. “Believe me there is cash now available,” Johnson told Sky News. “(And) I’m prepared to borrow to finance certain great objectives but overall we will keep fiscal responsibility.” Foreign Secretary Hunt also pledged to slash corporation tax to drive economic growth, enabling him to increase spending on social care, defence and education. With Britain now due to leave the European Union on Oct. 31, much of the debate has revolved around how the two candidates would steer the world’s fifth-largest economy out of the world’s biggest trading bloc without crippling growth. With the winner decided by Conservative Party members, who overwhelmingly back Brexit, Hunt has toughened his language, saying he would take a decision at the beginning of October to go for a disorderly no-deal exit if there was no prospect of getting an agreement through parliament. Asked how he would face the owners and employees of small companies put at jeopardy by such a decision, Hunt said democracy must come first. “We are a country where politicians do what the people tell them to do,” he told BBC TV. “If we have to leave without a deal I would do that but I would find support for those companies to help them weather the storms.” The self-proclaimed entrepreneur said a plan to cut the corporate tax rate to 12.5%, matching the level in Ireland and one of the lowest in any major economy, would become even more important in the event of a no-deal because it would support companies through the upheaval. The rate is currently 19%. “Of (my spending) commitments, the one I would not drop is the one to reduce corporation tax. It would fire up the economy in a way that would be helpful in a no-deal context.” With four months until Britain’s next deadline to leave the EU, the two men also sought to show they had advanced plans for how they would handle Britain’s departure. Hunt said he had been in talks with the former Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper, who negotiated a trade deal with the EU. In other possible government moves, a source said Britain’s lead Brexit negotiator Olly Robbins was overdue a change of job while Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, could become Britain’s ambassador in Washington under a Johnson government. According to the Mail on Sunday, Johnson also has a transition team which is preparing to invite EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the bloc’s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier to London to reopen talks once he is in power. Asked by Sky News how he could seal a new deal when the EU has said it will not reopen the withdrawal agreement, Johnson said “it’s possibly the case that they would say that at this particular stage in the negotiations ... Let’s see”. Talking up his plans for the future, the former foreign secretary echoed Ronald Reagan in quoting the 14th century scholar Ibn Khaldun’s belief that cutting taxes would spur economic growth and said businesses would be supported under his leadership. The former London mayor has been heavily criticized for a reported dismissal last year of companies’ concerns about Brexit with the comment “fuck business”. He said on Sunday that and several other comments that have drawn attention had been taken out of context. Keeping up the pressure on both candidates was Nigel Farage, who told a rally of his Brexit Party in Birmingham that neither man could be trusted, and he would not be put back in his box. The Brexit Party, launched only in April, swept to victory in the United Kingdom’s European Parliament election in May, riding a wave of anger over May’s failure to deliver Brexit.

"477"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-robert-j-friend-tuskegee-pilot-who-led-ufo-project-dies-at-99-3/"|"Sam Roberts"|"Robert J. Friend, one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen, who defied racism at home and enemy fire over Europe and who later oversaw the federal government’s investigation into UFOs, died on June 21 in Long Beach, Calif. He was 99. The cause was sepsis, his daughter Karen Friend Crumlich said. Refused enlistment in the United States Army Air Forces because he was African-American, he was among the 355 pilots who served in the all-black unit known as the Tuskegee Airmen, flying single-engine planes into combat in the Mediterranean theatre during the Second World War. His death leaves 11 surviving pilots from the unit. Remaining in the military in what became the Air Force and rising to lieutenant-colonel, he directed Project Blue Book, the government’s secret study of unidentified flying objects, assessing whether they posed a threat to national security or might advance scientific research. He held the post from 1958 to 1963. When, after 20 years, the project ended in 1969, about 700 of more than 12,000 sightings had been classified as unidentified. But the study concluded that the objects posed no danger and displayed no perplexing technological attributes. Speaking at the National Atomic Testing Museum in 2017, Mr. Friend, by then retired, expressed skepticism, for practical reasons, that aliens from outer space had ever landed on Earth. “Do I believe that we have been visited? No, I don’t believe that,” he said. “And the reason I don’t believe it is because I can’t conceive of any of the ways in which we could overcome some of these things: How much food would you have to take with you on a trip for 22 years through space? How much fuel would you need? How much oxygen or other things to sustain life do you have to have?” But unlike many of his colleagues, he favoured further research. “I, for one, also believe that the probability of there being life elsewhere in this big cosmos is just absolutely out of this world – I think the probability is there,” he said. Long after Project Blue Book had ended, it commanded scrutiny again after The New York Times disclosed in 2017 that the government’s research into unidentified objects had continued under a secret effort called the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program. The disclosure inspired the Project Blue Book series on the History channel last year. Robert Jones Friend was born Feb. 29, 1920, in Columbia, S.C., the oldest of four children. His father, William A. Friend, was an immigrant from Ecuador who had served in the United States Army in the First World War and who married Nella Mae Jones Liner, Robert’s mother. An airplane enthusiast even as a child, Mr. Friend joined the Civilian Pilot Training program as a sophomore at the historically black Lincoln University in Oxford, Pa. As a non-white, he was rejected for flight training by the U.S. Army Air Forces but accepted as an air cadet in the 99th Pursuit Squadron, a unit for black men begun in June, 1941, and unofficially named for their training site at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. Mr. Friend was assigned to the 322nd Fighter Group and flew 142 missions in P-47 and P-51 Mustang fighters. He named his single-seater plane Bunny, after his girlfriend and future wife, and decorated the nose, rudder and wing tops with the distinctive colour that inspired the airmen’s nickname, the Red Tails. He became the primary wingman to the fighter group’s commanding officer, Colonel Benjamin O. Davis Jr., who later became the first black general in the Air Force. Mr. Friend recalled at least two perilous missions, both in 1944. Bullets from his 50-calibre machine guns struck an oil barge in Germany, detonating an explosion that nearly downed his own plane. A few days later, flying at night in foul weather, with his plane hobbled by mechanical flaws, he bailed out over a mountainous part of Italy. As he hit the ground he spotted a woman running toward him brandishing a knife. It turned out, he told The Washington Post, that she was desperate only for the silk from his parachute. Mr. Friend and his fellow airmen were awarded the Congressional Gold Medal. After the war, he studied astrophysics at the Air Force Institute of Technology and business at the University of California, Los Angeles. During his 28-year military career, he also served as an operations officer during the Korean and Vietnam Wars; worked on the Titan, Atlas and Delta rocket programs; and became an executive of two aerospace companies, Stanford Mu and Fairchild Stratos. His marriages to Doris (Bunny) Hall and Kathryn Ann Holland ended in divorce. His third wife, Anna (Rice) Friend, died in 2010. He leaves two children from his first marriage, Thelma Hoffman and Robert Jr.; three children from his second marriage, Michael, Debra Carter and Dana Friend; a daughter from his third marriage, Karen Crumlich; an adopted daughter, Clara Ann Browning, from his third wife’s previous marriage; 18 grandchildren; 32 great-grandchildren; and 14 great-great-grandchildren. His son Darryl, from his second marriage, died in 2002 while on active duty in the military. OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE: The adversity Mr. Friend encountered during the war came not just from the enemy. He, like the others in his unit, had to deal with the racism of fellow Americans. On one occasion, in Sicily, white servicemen refused to share their quarters with African-Americans, he told The Desert Sun in Palm Springs, California, in 2017. But he did not think of himself as a racial trailblazer so much as simply a pilot fighting for his country, he said. “I never felt that I was anything but an American doing a job,” he said.

Alek Sigley, one of only a handful of Western students in the secretive country, has been missing for several days. His family had taken down his social-media accounts to prevent unnecessary speculation online. Mr. Sigley’s Facebook page reappeared overnight, but it is not known who reinstated it, or why. It had disappeared again on Saturday by 2 p.m. Sydney time (0400 GMT) and remained down on Sunday morning. Mr. Sigley’s Twitter account has remained online and members of the public have posted messages of support there. The missing man’s last posts on his Twitter and Facebook profiles are from June 24, and his family has not heard from him since Tuesday. Speaking from the Group of 20 Summit in Osaka, Japan, Mr. Morrison said he had spoken to Mr. Sigley’s family and said Australia was still trying to find out what happened to him. “I will just be measured in what I say because that is all about using the best opportunities we have right now to, to inform ourselves about where Alek is and what his safety is and where he is being held, in what conditions,” he told reporters on Saturday evening. Mr. Morrison said numerous world leaders had offered help to find Mr. Sigley and bring him home. When asked if U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit to the Korean demilitarized zone presented an opportunity for the Americans to make representations, Mr. Morrison said he would not allow the issue to be taken up with other agendas. “We’re going to work with everybody to secure Alek’s safety and the best way we can do that is doing it quietly, effectively, working with our partners,” he said. “This is, not allowing this to be taken up into other agendas, it’s not about that, it’s simply for me, about Alek’s safety. Sorry.” The 29-year-old Australian moved to North Korea to study for a master’s degree in Korean literature at Kim Il-sung University in Pyongyang, and also ran a small tour company specializing in educational trips to North Korea. Mr. Sigley has been an unusually active social-media user for someone living in North Korea, updating his social-media accounts with photos and blog posts about benign subjects such as food and fashion. The treatment of foreign citizens by the secretive North Korea has long been a contentious issue. American student Otto Warmbier died in 2017 after being detained in North Korea for stealing a propaganda poster from his hotel room.

"480"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-un-chief-warns-paris-climate-goals-still-not-enough-urges-immediate/"|"Aya Batrawy Malak Harb"|"United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres took his global message urging immediate climate action to officials gathered on Sunday in the United Arab Emirates, where production of hydrocarbons remains a key driver of the economy. Mr. Guterres is calling on governments to stop building new coal plants by 2020, cut greenhouse emissions by 45 per cent over the next decade and overhauling fossil fuel-driven economies with new technologies like solar and wind. The world, he said, “is facing a grave climate emergency.” In remarks at a summit in Abu Dhabi, he painted a grim picture of how rapidly climate change is advancing, saying it is outpacing efforts to address it. He lauded the Paris climate accord, but said even if its promises are fully met, the world still faces what he described as a catastrophic three-degree temperature rise by the end of the century. Arctic permafrost is melting decades earlier than even worst-case scenarios, he said, threatening to unlock vast amounts of methane, a greenhouse gas. “It is plain to me that we have no time to lose,” Mr. Guterres said. “Sadly, it is not yet plain to all the decision makers that run our world.” He spoke at the opulent Emirates Palace, where Abu Dhabi was hosting a preparatory meeting for the UN Climate Action Summit in September. Mr. Guterres was expected to later take a helicopter ride to view Abu Dhabi’s Noor solar power plant. When asked, UN representatives said the lavish Abu Dhabi summit and his planned helicopter ride would be carbon neutral, meaning their effects would be balanced by efforts like planting trees and sequestering emissions. The UN says carbon dioxide emissions account for about 80 per cent of global warming. Mr. Guterres was in Abu Dhabi fresh off meetings with Group of 20 leaders in Osaka, Japan. There, he appealed directly to heads of state of the world’s main emitters to step up their efforts. The countries of the G20 represent 80 per cent of world emissions of greenhouse gases, he said. At the G20 meeting, 19 countries expressed their commitment to the Paris agreement, with only the United States dissenting. In 2017, President Donald Trump pledged to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement as soon as 2020, arguing it disadvantages American workers and taxpayers. Mr. Trump has also moved steadily to dismantle Obama administration efforts to rein in coal, oil and gas emissions. His position has been that these efforts also hurt the U.S. economy. The Secretary-General’s special envoy for the climate summit, Ambassador Luis Alfonso de Alba, told the Associated Press it was disappointing that the U.S. has pulled out from the accord. However, he said there are many examples of efforts at the local and state level in the United States to combat climate change. “I think it is very important to have all countries committing to this cause ... even more when we are talking about the country of the importance and the size – not only in terms of the economy but also the emissions – of the United States,” he said. Mr. Guterres is urging business leaders and politicians to come to the Climate Action Summit later this year with their plans ready to nearly halve greenhouse emissions by 2030 and reach carbon neutrality by 2050. He suggested taxing major carbon-emitting industries and polluters, ending the subsidization of oil and gas, and halting the building of all new coal plants by next year. “We are in a battle for our lives,” he said. “But it is a battle we can win.” Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day’s most important headlines.

"481"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-for-afghan-women-an-end-to-illiteracy-is-only-a-few-cellphone-calls/"|"Stefanie Glinski"|"For most of her life, Fatima Ali could only count to 25: the number of animals she had to take care of as a shepherd girl. When she was barely in her teenage years, living in Afghanistan’s Ghor province, she was told she was too old to work away from home, was not allowed to go out alone and was soon married off. Shortly later, Fatima became a mother and thought she’d missed her chance to ever learn to read or write. Now in her 30s, with three children, she’s finally getting the chance. A new venture, developed by Partnership-Afghanistan and Canada (PAC) in collaboration with the University of British Columbia and World Vision, has started to bring education to women in Afghanistan’s most remote communities through mobile classes. Daily prerecorded phone calls deliver a set of sessions teaching reading and writing skills in Dari, a Persian dialect and one of Afghanistan’s main languages. And all the women need is a pen, some paper, a textbook for learning the alphabet and a cellphone. The calls focus on letter pronunciation and, once the alphabet is memorized, simple reading exercises. Since the program launch, 200 women have participated, with a total of 76 lessons available. With the majority of Afghans still living in rural areas, often with relatives working in neighbouring countries, simple cellphones – even if shared among family members – are common for both emergencies and to stay in touch with family. Throughout most of the country, reception is now available through a number of Afghan telecommunications providers. Fatima, with a green head scarf tossed over her black hair, crouches on a thin pillow on the concrete floor outside her house’s living room at 9 o’clock every morning, books spread out in front of her, waiting for her cellphone to ring. Inside the house, her children sit mesmerized in front of an old TV. “The lessons take me through a book and teach me how to pronounce letters and words,” she says proudly through a Dari translator. In Afghanistan, a country mired in conflict for decades, education continues to be under threat. Last year was the deadliest yet for civilians, according to a report from the United Nations, and while peace talks between the Taliban and United States are under way, the Afghan government has largely been left out. Hundreds of schools across the country are closed because of conflict or occupied by armed forces. There were 192 attacks on schools in 2018, up from 68 the previous year, according to Unicef. Bleak literacy numbers confirm just that: Only 38 per cent of adults are literate, says UNESCO, with the female rate dipping to 17 per cent – most of them living in urban areas. The country has seen a surge in violence since April, when the Taliban announced their annual fighting season, and in areas in which war is raging, education takes a backseat. For Fatima, living in a village outside Herat with a conservative husband who largely restricts her to the house, mobile education is her only chance. “It’s exactly why we came up with the idea,” says Shahnaz Qayumi, who was born in Afghanistan, left in the 1970s and now lives in Vancouver where she teaches early childhood education at Langara College and serves as a board member at PAC, a Canadian humanitarian organization working toward sustainable peace and development in Afghanistan. “It’s the most useful way to deliver education to rural women who are locked behind thick walls in the dominant male society and are often discouraged to leave the house for the purpose of education. We adopted our approached to the environment and to cater to families significantly affected by the stress and violence of war,” she explains. But while the software required to run the program was quickly developed with a team of UBC’s tech experts, setting up LIVES (Learning Through Interactive Voice Educational System) on the ground was a different story. Recording lessons and finding a telecommunications company to partner with proved to be a lot of work. What was even more challenging, however, was making the program accessible to the women. “You wouldn’t believe what we had to deal with,” says Arezu Popal, who works for World Vision, the aid agency that rolled out the program. Most women resided in dangerous areas or were displaced. Some, she says, lived on unpaved roads as far as 15 hours away from Herat, where the program is based. Then there was the matter of persuading the husbands to share their wives’ phone numbers. "They were suspicious. It took a while for them to understand that every time their wives’ phones rang, it was only a recorded voice of a woman.” All calls are made through Roshan, an Afghan telecommunications company with antennas across most of the 37-million-strong country, which charges the program a monthly subscription fee of about $1,600. “The system makes the call, but lessons and time slots are still assigned manually,” project manager Fahim Tabesh explains, pointing to a long spreadsheet of names and numbers on his computer screen. “They all pick up. The commitment is incredible.” Hawa Ebrahimi, a 25-year-old mother of five who grew up in a village surrounded by the Taliban, made that commitment herself just a few weeks ago. “Back home, we didn’t even have a road and definitely no school,” she explains through a Dari translator from her current residence, a spacious room with thick carpets and pillows lining the wall, in Herat. Abdul Qayum Rahimi, Herat’s governor, says that he’s seen real spirit when it comes to education in his province. “Everyone wants to advance and progress and people – mainly women – strive for education. It’s what makes this place one of the most developed areas in the country.” But while Hawa’s husband supports his wife’s education – he even comes home every evening asking if she studied and needs help with her homework – it hasn’t been as easy for Fatima. As a child, she grew up with a dominant father, who kicked her mother out when she was unable to give birth to more than one child. She sees similar patterns in her own husband, a man her father chose. “He’s sick at home these days with hepatitis and he doesn’t see the benefit of an education,” Fatima explains. Holding on to her books and her small black cellphone, she says it doesn’t matter to her, though. “I’m going to be literate and can maybe even help my children with their homework one day. For the first time in my life, I’m doing what I want to do.” "|"For Afghan women, an end to illiteracy is a few cellphone calls away – thanks to a made-in-Canada plan"|"2019-06-30T20:30:39-0400"|"illiteracy,women's rights,cell phone education,prerecorded lessons,Partnership-Afghanistan and Canada (PAC),University of British Columbia and World Vision,Taliban,Unicef,UNESCO,LIVES (Learning Through Interactive Voice Educational System),Afghan telecommunications company Roshan,education,afghanistan,country,program", 
"482"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-japanese-ships-prepare-to-resume-commercial-whaling/"|"Elaine Lies"|"Five small ships sailed out of harbour on Monday in Japan’s first commercial whale hunt in more than three decades, a move that has aroused global condemnation and fears for the fate of whales. Japan has long said few whale species are endangered, and news in December that it was leaving the International Whaling Commission (IWC) to resume hunting was the culmination of years of campaigns by industry supporters and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, whose constituency includes a city that has long whaled. “If we had more whale available, we’d eat it more,” said Sachiko Sakai, a 66-year-old taxi driver in Kushiro, a gritty port city on the northernmost main island of Hokkaido, where the whaling ships were waved out of harbour in a brief ceremony. “It’s part of Japan’s food culture,” said Sakai, adding that she ate a lot of whale as a child. “The world opposes killing whales, but you can say the same thing about many of the animals bred on land and killed for food.” The ships, which are set to be joined by vessels from the southern port of Shimonoseki, will spend much of the summer hunting for minke and Baird’s beaked whales. Crew in orange life vests took positions on the decks as the blue-hulled ships sailed out of Kushiro, some with red banners fluttering from their masts. Japan began whaling for scientific research a year after a 1986 ban on commercial whaling, aiming to gather what it called crucial population data, but it abandoned commercial whaling in 1988. Critics said the program was simply commercial whaling in disguise, after the meat of animals taken in scientific whaling ended up on store shelves and in restaurants. This year’s quota for commercial whaling, including minkes, sei whales and Bryde’s whales, is 227, the Fisheries Agency said. The quota, to be set annually, is less than the 330 whales Japan harvested in the Antarctic until recently. Environmentalists said the launch was delayed until after a summit of leaders of G20 major economies that Japan hosted, but whaling proponents have denied this. “This is a sad day for whale protection globally,” said Nicola Beynon of Humane Society International. “The word ‘research’ may have been removed from the side of the factory ship, finally ending Japan’s charade of harpooning whales under the guise of science, but these magnificent creatures will still be slaughtered for no legitimate reason,” Beynon, based in Australia, said in a statement. Whaling is a tiny industry in Japan. Whale makes up about 0.1 per cent of all meat eaten in a year, with about 300 people directly linked to whaling. Japan’s annual supplies of about 4,000 tonnes to 5,000 tonnes amount to 40 gm. to 50 gm. for each citizen, or about the weight of half an apple. Even whaling supporters say building demand will take time. Patrick Ramage, head of the International Fund for Animal Welfare, called the move a face-saving solution that could eventually lead Japan to abandon whaling. “It’s a good decision for whales, it’s a good decision for Japan, and it’s a good decision for international marine conservation,” he said.

"483"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-hong-kong-prepares-for-annual-pro-democracy-march-amid-extradition/"|"Anne Marie Roantree Noah Sin"|"Thousands of demonstrators faced off with riot police early on Monday, the anniversary of Hong Kong’s return to Chinese rule, as authorities braced for more mass protests amid widespread anger over a controversial extradition bill. More than a million people have taken to the streets at times over the past three weeks to vent their anger and frustration at Hong Kong’s Beijing-backed leader Carrie Lam, posing the greatest popular challenge to Chinese leader Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012. Opponents of the now-suspended extradition bill, which would allow people to be sent to mainland China for trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party, fear it is a threat to Hong Kong’s much-cherished rule of law and are demanding it be scrapped and Lam step down. Police fired pepper spray to disperse some demonstrators, mostly black-clad students wearing hard hats and face masks, ahead of a flag-raising ceremony to mark the 22nd anniversary of Hong Kong’s handover from British to Chinese rule. Riot police with helmets and batons raced towards protesters at one point and held up red banners warning they would use force if the activists charged. The protesters once again paralyzed parts of the financial hub as they occupied roads after blocking them off with metal barriers and wooden planks. A tired-looking Lam appeared in public for the first time in nearly two weeks to attend the anniversary ceremony, flanked by her husband and former Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa. Weeks of unrest forced nervous authorities to deploy a massive security blanket around the waterfront Convention and Exhibition Centre, the venue for the flag-raising ceremony. Lam said the government needed to change its style of governance and pledged to do more for young people. “The incident that happened in recent months has led to controversies and disputes between the public and the government. This has made me fully realize that I, as a politician, have to remind myself all the time of the need to grasp public sentiments accurately,” Lam said. “After this incident, I will learn the lesson and ensure that the government’s future work will be closer and more responsive to the aspirations, sentiments and opinions of the community,” she said. A person who attended the ceremony told Reuters the atmosphere was stiff and there were fewer people in attendance than previous years, with high-profile business figures noticeably absent. The anniversary of the handover of the former British colony to Beijing in 1997 has been marked in recent years by deepening despondency about what many Hong Kong residents see as a relentless march towards mainland control. Tensions spiralled on June 12 when police fired rubber bullets and tear gas at anti-extradition protesters near the heart of the city, sending plumes of smoke billowing among some of the world’s tallest skyscrapers. Lam’s suspension of the bill, following the largest and most violent protests in decades, has done little to pacify opponents who are demanding it be scrapped altogether. The extradition law has hit a nerve across Hong Kong, drawing criticism from business people, legal circles, schools and church groups, and has plunged the Asian financial centre into political turmoil. Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule under a “one country, two systems” formula that allows freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China, including freedom of protest and a much-cherished independent judiciary. Beijing denies interfering but, for many Hong Kong residents, the extradition bill is the latest step in a relentless march towards mainland control. The uproar over the bill has reignited a protest movement that had lost steam after pro-democracy demonstrations in 2014 failed to force concessions from Beijing and led to the arrests of hundreds of activists. Organizers of the recent protests say they are confident that anger over the government’s failure to withdraw the extradition bill will boost numbers at the annual rally on Monday, a public holiday on which financial markets and most businesses will be closed. The pro-democracy rally is due to start at 0630 GMT in Victoria Park on Hong Kong island and end at government offices near the heart of the financial centre. Activists raised a black bauhinia flag to half mast outside the Legislative Council building before the rally and turned Hong Kong’s official flag, featuring a white bauhinia flower on a red background, upside down. The recent demonstrations have brought havoc, forcing the closure of government offices on several occasions and triggering chaos as protesters blocked roads and besieged police headquarters. The South China Morning Post cited unidentified sources as saying about 5,000 riot police would be ready for any trouble. The turmoil comes at a delicate time for Beijing, which is grappling with a trade dispute with the United States, a faltering economy and tensions in the South China Sea. Lam said after suspending the bill she had heard the people “loud and clear.” However, she stopped short of activists’ demands to scrap the bill altogether and rejected calls to step down. She is clinging to her job despite an unprecedented backlash against the government that has galvanized people from all walks of life to take to the streets in protest. Activists are also demanding the government drop charges against those arrested during the protests, charge police with what they describe as excessive use of force and stop referring to the demonstrations as a riot, a term that can bring a heavier jail sentence. Opponents of the extradition bill fear it would put them at the mercy of China’s justice system, where human rights are not guaranteed. Beyond the public outcry, the extradition bill has spooked some of Hong Kong’s tycoons into starting to move their personal wealth offshore, according to financial advisers, bankers and lawyers familiar with the details.

"484"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-first-battery-powered-cruise-ship-sails-for-the-arctic-3/"|"Victoria Klesty"|"The world’s first cruise ship propelled partially by battery power is set to head out from northern Norway on its maiden voyage, cruise operator Hurtigruten said on Monday. The hybrid expedition cruise ship, the Roald Amundsen, can take 500 passengers and is designed to sail in harsh climate waters. Named after the Norwegian explorer who navigated the Northwest Passage in 1903-1906 and was first to reach the South Pole in 1911, the ship heads for the Arctic from Tromsoe this week and will sail the Northwest Passage to Alaska before heading south, reaching Antarctica in October. While the engines run mainly on marine gasoil, the ship’s battery pack enables it to run solely on batteries for around 45 to 60 minutes under ideal conditions, Hurtigruten Chief Executive Daniel Skjeldam told Reuters. The company estimates that the battery pack will reduce fuel consumption and save about 20% in carbon dioxide emissions, compared to if the ship was operating on marine gasoil alone. “It’s designed to take excessive energy from the engines and put into the battery when the ship doesn’t need it, and put it back into the engine when the ship needs it — it is a way of reducing emissions significantly without having charging stations available,” Skjeldam said. The company, which operates scenic cruise lines along the country’s fjords and into the Arctic, was inspired by Norway’s fleet of hybrid ferries and also its growing fleet of electric cars, he said. Battery technology for propelling ships is in its infancy, even on shorter routes, as few ports provide charging stations. “We expect batteries to be an important part of shipping in the years to come, but of course we don’t expect our ships to be able to operate only on batteries, because the ship can sail up to 18-20 days in areas where there are no charging points,” Skjeldam said. Hurtigruten expects infrastructure will improve on its traditional routes along the Norwegian coast, while currently charging services are only provided in Bergen, Norway’s second-largest city. The future for batteries on larger ships also hinges on suppliers’ capacity to develop lighter, more powerful systems. “We expect a revolution on battery technology for ships, we expect batteries to be lighter, more effective, and we’ve set aside extra room for more batteries to be installed when battery packs become more effective,” Skjeldam said. He added that the second hybrid cruise ship the company has on order, to be delivered later this year, will have battery pack with twice the capacity of the Roald Amundsen.

"485"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-opec-set-to-extend-oil-supply-cut-as-iran-endorses-pact-4/"|"Alex Lawler"|"OPEC and its allies look set to extend oil supply cuts this week at least until the end of 2019 as Iran joined top producers Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Russia in endorsing a policy aimed at propping up the price of crude amid a weakening global economy. Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh told reporters on Monday he would support prolonging output cuts by six to nine months. Tehran has in the past objected to policies put forward by arch-rival Saudi Arabia, saying Riyadh was too close to Washington. “I have no problem with a production cut … It’s going to be an easy meeting as my stance is very clear,” Zanganeh told reporters upon arriving in Vienna. The United States is not a member of OPEC, nor is it participating in the supply pact. Washington has demanded Riyadh pump more oil to compensate for lower exports from Iran after slapping fresh sanctions on Tehran over its nuclear program. OPEC and its allies led by Russia have been reducing oil output since 2017 to prevent prices from sliding amid soaring production from the United States, which has become the world’s top producer this year ahead of Russia and Saudi Arabia. Fears about weaker global demand as a result of a U.S.-China trade spat have added to the challenges faced by the 14-nation Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in recent months. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Saturday he had agreed with Saudi Arabia to extend existing output cuts of 1.2 million barrels per day, or 1.2% of global demand, by six to nine months - until December 2019 or March 2020. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said the deal would most likely be extended by nine months and no deeper reductions were needed. “It’s a rollover and it’s happening,” Falih, whose country is the de facto leader of OPEC, told reporters on Sunday. Benchmark Brent crude has climbed more than 25% since the start of 2019 but prices could stall as a slowing global economy squeezes demand and U.S. oil floods the market, a Reuters poll of analysts found. Brent rose by $2 on Monday towards $67 per barrel as traders cited OPEC’s resolve to curb output. The output-cutting pact expired on Sunday. OPEC meets in Vienna on Monday followed by talks with Russia and other allies, a grouping known as OPEC+, on Tuesday. The Monday meeting is not expected to start before 1100-1200 GMT. A ministerial monitoring committee met before the main OPEC gathering and recommended that cuts be extended by nine months with the same country quotas, three OPEC sources said. Zanganeh said he would not object to deepening the cuts but expressed frustration that Putin had announced the deal at a G20 summit in Osaka before waiting for OPEC to gather in Vienna. “The important thing to me is that OPEC remains OPEC. It has lost its authority and it’s on the verge of collapse,” Zanganeh said. “Iran is not going to leave OPEC but I believe OPEC is going to die with these processes.” Zanganeh also said he would reject a proposal to sign a new charter for cooperation with non-OPEC, led by Russia: “I believe it is not the time to discuss this matter because inside OPEC we have a lot of difficulty.” Iran’s exports have plummeted to 0.3 million barrels per day in June from as much as 2.5 million bpd in April 2018 due to Washington’s fresh sanctions. The sanctions are putting Iran under unprecedented pressure. Even in 2012, when the European Union joined U.S. sanctions on Tehran, the country’s exports stood at around 1 million bpd. Oil represents the lion’s share of Iran’s budget revenues. Washington has said it wants to change what it calls a “corrupt” regime in Tehran. Iran has denounced the sanctions as illegal and says the White House is run by “mentally retarded” people. “Worsening tensions between the U.S. and Iran add potential for oil price volatility that could be tricky for OPEC members to manage,” said Ann-Louise Hittle, vice president, macro oils, at consultancy Wood Mackenzie. “Geopolitical risk means the supply outlook is tightening, offsetting the moderate weakening in oil demand growth thus far this year,” she added.

"486"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-joyce-pensato-who-made-cartoon-characters-complex-dies-at-78-2/"|"Roberta Smith"|"Joyce Pensato, a painter who took the abstract out of abstract expressionism and added a little pop, making large-scale black-and-white paintings that transformed popular cartoon characters into ambiguous, emotionally complex and sometimes scary creatures, died on June 13 in Manhattan. She was 78. Petzel Gallery, which has represented her since 2007, said the cause was pancreatic cancer. Ms. Pensato was a late bloomer: Her art did not mature until after she turned 50, in the early 1990s. Success in the form of a fully committed New York gallery arrived even later, when Petzel staged the first of several solo shows of her work in 2007. But she possessed the irrepressible joie de vivre and irreverence needed to make up for lost time. She started dyeing her hair blonde in the late ’90s and tended to dress like a punk teenager – in black leggings and black T-shirts emblazoned with band logos – and often accessorized with bling. She was frequently photographed, or photographed herself, vamping in front of her paintings, wearing mirrored aviator glasses or making gang signs. Her studio in the city’s Williamsburg neighbourhood was well known for its piles of dirty, paint-splattered toys, stuffed animals, figurines and masks of pop-culture characters: Batman, Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Felix the Cat, the malcontents of South Park and members of the Simpson family. Rescued from the street or thrift shops, these artifacts served as her models; in essence, she worked from life. Yet she was uninterested in her subjects’ projections of innocence and happiness. She once said, during a videotaped studio visit, that she thought Walt Disney had made Mickey Mouse seem “lobotomized.” She wanted to extract much stronger, more conflicted feelings and a sometimes demonic energy from her seemingly placid pop-culture sitters. In a sense, her paintings are acts of liberation achieved with large-scale, aggressive, action-filled brushwork and a severe black-and-white palette. Her images often bear down on or tower over the viewer; one writer compared them to Easter Island heads. They are variously comedic, menacing or pathetic – or, confusingly, all three at once. Painted and repainted in broad, blurred strokes, the images hemorrhage torrents of drips and splashes and appear to be made quickly, furiously. In fact, Ms. Pensato worked relatively slowly, studying, adjusting and revising her compositions until she got what she wanted. In all her work, she subverted both sides of the high-low equation, ridiculing and exaggerating abstract-expressionist technique while imbuing pop-culture characters with raw, uncontrollable feelings that were more real and gripping than the angst of the abstract expressionists. Her 2013 survey at the Santa Monica Museum of Art in California was titled I Killed Kenny, a variation on a line frequently heard on South Park. Joyce Marie Pensato was born on Aug. 29, 1940, in Brooklyn, N.Y., to Stefano and Anna (Lombardo) Pensato. Her father was a print maker who worked with artists on their books; her mother was a homemaker. She leaves a brother, Benedict. Ms. Pensato grew up wanting to be an artist. After graduating from P.S. 123 in Brooklyn, she ended up at the Art Students League thinking she would study commercial art, with some painting on the side. But lacking the necessary steadiness of hand and eye for detail for commercial art, she was directed toward painting. She studied primarily with painter Morris Kantor and described his class as “love at first sight.” “I knew this was it,” she said. When a friend told her that she should be at the New York Studio School – something of a bastion of figuration and pure painting in Lower Manhattan – she applied but was rejected. Returning to the league, she received a travel scholarship and spent a year in Europe soaking up art. On her return, she applied to the Studio School again, and this time she was accepted. She arrived in the summer of 1973, completed the school’s four-year program and stayed on as an alumna in residence. She studied with Mercedes Matter, a painter and one of the school’s founders, who supported her work unstintingly; had her efforts critiqued by painter Philip Guston, who did not initially like her work; and, for a time, shared a studio with painter Christopher Wool, who remained a friend. His use of enamel paint would later influence her decision to switch to it from oil. While at the school, Ms. Pensato began collecting pop-culture detritus in her studio, and when Ms. Matter suggested that she make a still life, Ms. Pensato based a charcoal drawing on a life-size Batman cut-out she had found on the street. She continued to make charcoal drawings based on her pop-culture material over the next decade, developing a vocabulary of expressionistic marks and erasures. But she did not consider exhibiting them; at the time, she was pursuing abstract, expressionistic landscapes in oil, and colour, on canvas. In 1983, Ms. Pensato began to be included in group shows in New York and elsewhere in the United States, and, around 1990, she landed a solo show with the Fiction/Non-Fiction Gallery in SoHo (the Team Gallery today). But it was cancelled at the last minute; the dealer felt that her work was not ready. Ms. Pensato was devastated, but she regrouped. Recognizing that she loved making her charcoal-drawing characters more than the paintings, she decided to release these beings onto canvas, replacing oil paint and colour with black, white and occasionally silver enamel, which was thick, yet quick-drying and crucial to her style. In addition to Ms. Matter, Ms. Pensato often cited abstract-expressionist painter Joan Mitchell as a mentor during her time at the Studio School. Ms. Mitchell, known for her lush revisions of French impressionism, once bluntly asked whether Ms. Pensato wanted to paint French (meaning with light and colour) or German (meaning dark and expressionistic). French, Ms. Pensato answered, but she knew it wasn’t true. As she later said, “It took me until 1990 to realize that the colour was not working for me.” "|"Joyce Pensato, who made cartoon characters complex, dies at 78"|"2019-06-28T17:40:15-0400"|"Joyce Pensato,obituary,world news,death,cancer,pancreatic cancer,cartoons,cartoon characters,Petzel Gallery,artist,school,work,time,pensato,art", 
"487"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-sculptor-robert-therrien-made-the-mundane-monumental/"|"Richard Sandomir"|"Robert Therrien, whose lifelong fascination with household objects such as tables, chairs, pots and pans led him to recreate them as colossal sculptures, died June 17 at his home in Los Angeles. He was 71. The cause was cancer, said Dean Anes, the liaison to Mr. Therrien from Manhattan’s Gagosian Gallery, which represented him. It was in the 1970s and ’80s that Mr. Therrien began drawing and sculpting generic things familiar to him from childhood: snowmen, keyholes, a coffin, a bird, a chapel, a hat on a stand. Those modest-size, minimalist works yielded in the 1990s to larger, more daring sculptures that toyed with perspectives of dimensions and space while adhering to realism. For his best-known work, Under the Table (1994), he reproduced his dining room table in comically huge dimensions. At 10-feet high, 20-feet long and 12-feet wide, the table (and six chairs) is fit for a gathering of giants. By making the table so large, Mr. Therrien seemed to render its viewers small while shifting their attention to what is beneath the table as they gaze upward. Reviewing a Therrien solo exhibition in 2008 at the Gagosian Gallery that included Under the Table, the critic Jeffrey Kastner wrote in Artforum: “Everyone, at some point in his or her childhood, sought refuge (for real or for fun) beneath the canopy of a table, and the disorienting mix of security and infantilization that this work produces” leads to a “surprisingly powerful bit of sculptural memory theatre.” For another work, Mr. Therrien stacked four-foot-wide dishes nearly eight-feet high in such a vertiginous way that they appear ready to tumble. In still another, he piled oversized pots and pans, seemingly willy-nilly, into a stack nine-feet high. Each work was secured by a metal spine that held the objects in place. Transforming ordinary objects, such as a table, into three-dimensional worlds proved a tantalizing challenge for Mr. Therrien. “The reason the table became big was because I asked, ‘What if people could walk into an environment like that?’ ” he said in an interview with The New York Times in 2013, when the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, N.Y., mounted an exhibition of his sculptures. Mr. Therrien was perhaps an heir to Claes Oldenburg and his humorous giant pop art sculptures. But with his more rigid attention to detail, Mr. Therrien, typically grim-faced in photographs, was more of a realist, as shown in his recreation of an eight-foot-high folding table and chairs in 2007. When the sculpture was included in an exhibition of hyper-real works at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis in 2012, the museum’s senior curator of visual arts, Siri Engberg, said: “To see how an artist elevated the mundane to the monumental was a showstopper and a head scratcher. What was fantastic was that it was not only gargantuan but totally functional. The legs fold like a card table’s.” Robert Edward Therrien was born on Nov. 17, 1947, in Chicago and moved with his parents to Palo Alto, Calif., where he sought treatment for asthma. He began to draw, mostly from comic books, as a boy. “I always remember thinking I was some sort of artist,” he told the Los Angeles Times in 2000, “then becoming obsessive about it as a teenager.” He attended what is now the California College of the Arts in Oakland, Calif., before studying photography at the Brooks Institute in Santa Barbara, Calif., and painting at the affiliated Santa Barbara Institute. After earning a master of fine arts degree from the University of Southern California in 1974, he started working from a loft in Los Angeles making wall reliefs and small sculptures. Photography led him to create his big, realistic sculptures, most notably Under the Table. He drew on Polaroid pictures he had taken of his dining table to rethink it as “an interior with a complexity of horizontals and verticals and diagonals,” he said, “so that it would be like being in a jungle of legs.” Mr. Therrien did not work only in Gulliver sizes. He also examined the relationship between objects and their environments in a series of smaller, carefully staged spaces or rooms. His Transparent Room (2010) is a stand-alone glass house filled with transparent materials such as Bubble Wrap rolls and plastic hangers and garbage cans. Another work, Red Room (2000-2007), is a storeroom packed tightly, almost obsessively, with 888 red objects, including shoes, lanterns, sweaters, bricks, spray cleaners, kitchen utensils, a radio, a clock and a steamer trunk. Together they seem to fuse into a single red entity. Mr. Therrien’s work is in collections worldwide, including those of the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, the Centre Pompidou in Paris, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and the Broad in Los Angeles. He leaves a brother and sister. One of Mr. Therrien’s final works – two stylized frying pans, cast in bronze, hanging from a painted shelf – was part of a solo show last spring at the Gagosian Gallery in San Francisco. “How silly, one might think, to lavish the care required to remake iron kitchenware as a slightly sleeker version of itself,” the critic Charles Desmarais wrote in the San Francisco Chronicle. “Unless, of course, what is moulded is not metal but memory.” Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day’s most important headlines.

"488"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-powerful-bomb-blast-rocks-afghan-capital/"|"Fatima Faizi, Rod Nordland and Thomas Gibbons-Neff"|"A complex Taliban attack including a car-bombing and militant assault killed at least 40 people in Kabul on Monday, badly damaging a private war museum, an adjoining television station and a primary school, hurting dozens of children, officials said. The attack, apparently aimed at a government facility, came as U.S. and Taliban negotiators met for a third day in Qatar amid hopes for a deal on a U.S. troop withdrawal. But the pace of violence in the 18-year Afghan war has only picked up, with each side increasing attacks. A senior Kabul defense official put the death toll at six security force members, with another 20 of them wounded, and 34 civilians, with at least 63 civilians wounded, a toll that rose later in the day. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information. Nooria Nazhat, spokeswoman for the ministry of education, said that at least 51 students were wounded, including many young children. They were injured when part of their school building near the attack site collapsed from the detonation of a car bomb which began the Taliban attack. At Shamshad TV, a Pashto language channel, a security guard was killed and several journalists wounded, including two who were hospitalized, according to the news manager, Abid Ihas. The private war museum, which hosts many school groups, did not report any victims from the blast. Wahidullah Mayar, spokesman for the ministry of public health, said that 105 of the wounded civilians, including 26 children, were hurt badly enough to be hospitalized. Officials said that attackers were still holed up in a nearby ministry of defense building that they had run into after the bomb explosions. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, according to a Twitter message on the account of the Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, and said that a logistics and engineering unit of the ministry of defense was the intended target. “According to some reports, some civilians have been slightly wounded,” the spokesman said. “But civilians were not the target.” Nasrat Rahimi, spokesman for the interior ministry, said that a car bomb detonated near the museum and television complex, after which attackers entered a defense ministry building, where they were fighting with security forces who had surrounded them. He said one of the dead civilians was a child. Although there was no indication that the television station was a target, the Taliban have recently threatened Afghan journalists. In a statement a week ago that drew widespread condemnation, the insurgents said journalists who did not stop publishing what they considered anti-Taliban propaganda would be considered legitimate targets. Shamshad TV, a leading Pashto-language outlet, shares a compound with the Organization for Mine Clearance and Afghan Rehabilitation museum, or OMAR museum. The museum has war matériel from Afghanistan’s long conflict, going back to Soviet times, ranging from Russian helicopters to T-55 tanks. But the centerpiece of its displays are the many anti-personnel and other mines planted through the country, which has more mines than anywhere else in the world, and which has lost 30,000 civilians to mines since 1989. Schoolchildren tour the museum, which in the past has received funding from the U.S. government, to educate them about the dangers of handling mines and explosive projectiles. Fazel Rahim, director of the museum, said Monday’s bombing had damaged the television station, which was also attacked by Islamic State gunmen in 2017. “The poor Shamshad TV was destroyed again,” he said. “Some colleagues are wounded. I got out. The situation is bad.” Ihas, at Shamshad, said the station had been forced off the air by the blast but resumed broadcasting within 13 minutes. At the museum, the largely outdoor exhibit houses British rifles, U.S. cluster bomblets, Italian and Egyptian land mines, rusted artillery pieces, and dilapidated Soviet jet fighters in a cement-walled compound ringed by sandbags, barbed wire and a machine gun-mounted guard tower. Almost all of the exhibits inside are painted with three letters “FFE,” or Free From Explosives. The museum, opened in 2004 after the Taliban were run out of the capital three years earlier, gets around 1,000 visitors a year, but its contents hark back to an earlier period in Afghanistan’s long history of war. They include artifacts from the Soviet-led invasion and the brutal civil war that followed. Glaringly absent from the displays are weapons and equipment from the U.S.-led occupation since 2001 except for a few remnants of cluster bombs that were dropped in the early months of the war. (This is largely because the State Department has subsidized OMAR, spending $400 million since 2001 helping rebuild the museum and funding other demining programs across the country). The U.S. military dropped roughly 1,228 cluster bombs in Afghanistan between October 2001 and March 2002, according to a Human Rights Watch report from December 2002. At least 60 civilians have been killed, along with the two deminers, by the unexploded ordnance left behind. A small glass case filled with the U.S. munitions is what evidence remains, wedged near an Italian plastic anti-tank mine and some Russian rocket-propelled grenades. What is not in the museum is spread out across roughly 1,000 square miles of the country: anti-personnel mines, anti-tank mines, explosive remnants of war and booby traps, according to a recent quarterly report by the Mine Action Program of Afghanistan. Since 1989, more than 30,000 civilians have been wounded or killed by the explosive remains and deminers have cleared nearly 1,800 miles of the country. That means Afghanistan will not be cleared of buried explosives for decades. “We are deminers. We are not talking about political issues, we’re showing what’s happening in Afghanistan,” Rahim said about the museum in an interview in late May. That’s why there is an aging YAK-40 Soviet airliner affixed to the museum’s roof. It serves as an ad hoc classroom, with airline seats plastered with the OMAR logo and a flat-screen TV. Around 100 students, mostly children, sit in those seats a month, where they are taught the dangers of unexploded munitions — what they look like, not to touch them, not to play with them. And what happens if you do. According to the mine action report, 161 boys and girls were wounded or killed by such devices between January and March 2019. Menro, a 13-year-old in the sixth grade at Qahraman High School in Kabul, along with 34 other students, sat in the fuselage of the defunct jet on a recent simmering day in June. She had seen buried explosives in her village, read about them in books, but now she saw them, harmless, through a glass case. “Now I have a clear picture of mines in my head,” she said. “I will talk about mines to my friends. I want them to know how dangerous mines are.” "|"Coordinated Taliban attacks rock Afghan capital, leaving 40 dead and more than 100 wounded"|"2019-07-01T01:44:14-0400"|"International,Afghanistan,Afghanistan war,Kabul,explosion,bomb,Taliban,Afghan peace talks,Zalmay Khalilzad,museum,mine,mines,war,ministry,afghanistan", 
"489"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-iran-united-states-gulf-of-oman-nuclear-explainer/"|""|" It’s been a year since President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the global deal that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for limits on its nuclear-power programs. Since then, Tehran and Washington have been in a heated diplomatic and economic feud. It inched closer to actual war this spring, when the Iranians threatened to start up uranium enrichment again and the Americans deployed a carrier strike group and Patriot missile battery into the Middle East. Two attacks against commercial shipping in the Gulf of Oman escalated the conflict further: One on May 12, when four ships (including oil tankers belonging to Saudi Arabia, a U.S. ally) were hit by “sabotage operations” off the United Arab Emirates coast, and again on June 13, when two oil tankers were attacked near the Strait of Hormuz. Both times, the Trump administration blamed Iran; both times, Iran denied it. Then on June 17, Iran said it would break the nuclear deal and exceed its uranium limit unless the remaining signatories did something to save the deal by July 8. Soon after, the Pentagon announced 1,000 more troops would be deployed to the Middle East. Those troops came close to attacking Iranian targets on June 20, when Iran’s Revolutionary Guard shot down a U.S. surveillance drone that they said was in Iranian airspace in the southern province of Hormozgan, but that the U.S. military said was in international airspace over the Strait of Hormuz. Mr. Trump authorized retaliatory strikes, but said he changed his mind 10 minutes before they were due to be launched. Iran announced on July 1 that it had exceeded the low-enriched uranium limit, which the UN’s nuclear watchdog soon confirmed.  The Strait of Hormuz, which links the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the open ocean, is a narrow corridor through which nearly 40 per cent of the world’s crude oil passes – and Iran lies right alongside it. Iran has mined the strait before or threatened to close it entirely in times of crisis, such as its 1980-88 war with Iraq and the standoff over nuclear sanctions in the early 2010s. But the U.S. Navy, whose Fifth Fleet is based in Bahrain, has been in sometimes tense standoffs with Iran to ensure the strait stays open to shipping. The Middle East is split into two camps along political and religious lines: On one side is Saudi Arabia, which adheres to a hard-line version of Sunni Islam, and on the other is Shia Iran. Proxy conflicts between the blocs, such as the civil war in Yemen between Iran-aligned Houthi rebels and a Saudi-aligned national government, have taken an increasingly deadly toll in recent years. The sight of Saudi oil tankers exploding off the Iranian coast has raised fears of open warfare between Iran and a Saudi Arabia backed by U.S. military might. The 2015 deal, brokered by U.S. president Barack Obama between Iran and six world powers – Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States – set, among other things, a hard 300-kilogram limit on Iran’s low-enriched uranium stockpiles for 15 years. In exchange, the signatories would lift sanctions that had been crippling the Iranian economy. But the U.S. Congress gave the president power to review every 90 days whether Iran was complying with the deal. U.S. President Donald Trump, who campaigned openly against a deal he said was the “worst ever,” came to office in 2016 and renewed Iran’s cerficication twice before finally pulling out in May, 2018, restarting sanctions a few months later. The European signatories still support the deal, but have so far not delivered on promises to shield Iran from the economic impact of U.S. sanctions. Iran has warned Europe that, if it does not provide aid by July 8, it will start enriching more uranium.

The gathering apparently will be held on Taliban terms as there will be no official Afghan government representation. Trump told Fox News Channel’s Tucker Carlson Tonight on Monday that nearly half of all American troops have already been pulled out. That pullout was expected to be announced as part of a time frame being negotiated by Washington’s peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, who is in the middle of talks with the Taliban in Qatar. “I’ve wanted to pull them out. And you know, I have pulled a lot out. We were at 16,000. We’re down to about 9,000, which a lot of people don’t know,” Trump said, according to the transcript of the interview shared with The Associated Press. “So we’ve reduced the force very substantially in Afghanistan, which I don’t talk about very much, and that’s okay,” Trump added. The Taliban’s spokesman in Doha, Suhail Shaheen, has said that talks with Khalilzad are focused on a timetable for withdrawal of U.S. and NATO troops from Afghanistan. In a tweet on Monday, Shaheen had said talks would come with an announcement of a timetable for withdrawal of the estimated 20,000 service personnel, nearly 14,000 of whom are Americans. Trump’s comments Monday would seem to contradict a statement made by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo during a visit to Kabul on June 25. Pompeo said then that Washington had made no decision on a time frame for withdrawal. Trump also said in the Monday TV interview that he wanted to leave a strong intelligence gathering force behind in Afghanistan. “I’ll tell you the problem is, look, I would like to just get out. The problem is, (Afghanistan) just seems to be a lab for terrorists. It seems – I call it the Harvard of terrorists. … But I would leave very strong intelligence there,” he said, according to the transcript. Meanwhile, on the upcoming all-Afghan dialogue, Germany’s special representative Ambassador Markus Potzel said Tuesday that those attending “will participate only in their personal capacity and on an equal footing.” The Taliban have flatly refused to meet with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani’s government, which they consider a U.S. puppet, while repeatedly offering talks with anyone who comes to the table as an ordinary Afghan. The Taliban have already twice met with prominent Afghans, including former president Hamid Karzai and even members of the government’s peace council as well as opposition politicians. Those meetings have both been held in Moscow. The announced talks come a day after the Taliban claimed responsibility for a devastating attack in the Afghan capital of Kabul that killed at least six people and wounded more than 100 others, many of them children attending two schools in the area, according to the Education Ministry. Ghani has not responded to the announcement of next week’s talks. He has previously demanded the Taliban talk directly with his government, some of whom have complained about their continuing exclusion from meetings between Taliban and the U.S. peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad. Khalilzad, who is currently holding a seventh round of direct talks with the Taliban in Doha, already held a battery of meetings with the Afghan president in Kabul last month. In an overnight tweet, he welcomed the announced all-Afghan talks. He tweeted that “this dialogue is an essential element of the four-part peace framework & and important step in advancing the #AfghanPeaceProcess.” Germany will co-sponsor the talks with Qatar, according to the statement issued by Potzel, who is the German special representative for Pakistan and Afghanistan. An earlier intra-Afghan dialogue in Qatar was scuttled when the two sides couldn’t agree on participants. Potzel said the invitations this time have been jointly issued by Germany and Qatar. “Afghanistan stands at a critical moment of opportunity for progress toward peace,” Potzel said in the statement. “Only Afghans themselves can decide the future of their country.” He said both Qatar and Germany are hoping the talks will create trust between the warring sides. But for ordinary Afghans battered by relentless violence there is mostly frustration. “Peace will never come to Afghanistan,” said an angry Sawab Gul, who was waiting in the Afghan capital of Kabul on Tuesday to open his partially destroyed bedding store. At age 40, Gul said he has never seen peace in his country and holds out little hope for the current attempts at finding an end to Afghanistan’s relentless wars. “Every day people are dying. Afghanistan is like a hell for us Afghans,” he said. “I don’t think I will ever see peace.” Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day’s most important headlines.

The Sudanese Professionals Association, which has spearheaded protests since December, said security forces arrested Yassin Abdel-Karim, head of the Sudanese Teachers’ Committee, in the capital, Khartoum. The committee is part of the SPA. It said they also arrested lawyer Abdel-Majed Aidrous in the northern city of Atbara, the birthplace of the uprising that led to the military overthrow of former president Omar al-Bashir in April. The group said security forces searched the homes of three other leaders. The SPA is part of the Forces for the Declaration of Freedom and Change, which represents the protesters. A police spokesman did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The arrests came two days after protesters flooded the streets of Sudan’s main cities in the biggest show of numbers since security forces cleared a sit-in outside the military headquarters last month. At least 11 people were killed in clashes with security forces, according to protest organizers. Brigadier Gamal Adam, a spokesman for the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, said an RSF solider was killed and 29 others were wounded during Sunday’s protests. The FDFC on Monday called for marches in Khartoum and elsewhere on July 13 and for a general strike and civil disobedience the following day. The coalition is pressing the military to hand over power to a civilian-led body, fearing that the generals intend to cling to power or preserve some form of authoritarian rule. They have also demanded an investigation into the recent violence. “We do not trust in the military council,” activist Madani Abbas Madani said. “We will not put our weapon, which is the crowds of people, to just follow the road of negotiations alone.” The African Union and Ethiopia have stepped up mediation efforts aimed at bringing the two sides back to the negotiating table. They submitted a proposal last week that was welcomed by both sides, but the protesters have refused to meet with the generals until they fully accept it. The AU and Ethiopian envoys said they invited both sides for direct negotiations on Wednesday over the joint proposal. AU envoy Mohamed El Hacen Lebatt told a news conference in Khartoum on Tuesday that the military council and the FDFC responded “positively” to the proposal. But they have disagreed on the makeup of the sovereign council that would rule the country during the transition – a topic they would discuss during talks, he said. The Sudan Revolutionary Front, a rebel group that is part of the protest movement, meanwhile, threatened to negotiate separately with the military council amid growing disputes within the coalition, the English-language Sudan Tribune reported Monday. Gibril Ibrahim, an SRF leader, was quoted as saying that decision-making within the FDFC has been “kidnapped” by a small committee “formed in vague circumstances with limited representation.” General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, deputy head of the military council, met with SRF leader Minni Minawi in Chad last week, where they agreed to extend a ceasefire and start peace talks.

"493"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-brenda-maddox-biographer-who-revealed-joyces-muse-dies-at-87-2/"|"Neil Genzlinger"|"Brenda Maddox, a biographer whose books included one about James Joyce’s little-studied wife and muse and another about Rosalind Franklin, an overlooked DNA researcher, died June 16 at her home in London, England. She was 87. Her daughter, Bronwen Maddox, said the cause was complications of dementia. U.S.-born, Ms. Maddox had spent most of her adult life in Britain, maintaining a dual citizenship. Ms. Maddox was especially known for “Nora: The Real Life of Molly Bloom” (1988), about Nora Barnacle, who became James Joyce’s wife and was an inspiration for some of his female characters, including Molly Bloom of “Ulysses.” She had received little attention until Ms. Maddox’s biography, which, Caryn James wrote in a review in The New York Times, “redefines the muse as a down-to-earth woman whose devotion was always total and never blind.” Ms. Maddox also brought heightened attention to Ms. Franklin, an English scientist whose important contributions to the early study of the structure of DNA had gone largely unacknowledged as James D. Watson and Francis H.C. Crick shared the limelight for their now-familiar double-helix model. (The two men, along with Maurice Wilkins, later received a Nobel Prize.) Ms. Maddox’s biography, “Rosalind Franklin: The Dark Lady of DNA” (2002), “has restored to history the author of some of the most significant research into genetics,” Tara Pepper wrote in a review in Newsweek. Ms. Maddox also wrote biographies of better-known figures, including D.H. Lawrence: The Story of a Marriage (1994); Yeats’s Ghosts: The Secret Life of W.B. Yeats (1999); Maggie (2002), about Margaret Thatcher, which became the basis of a four-part television series in Britain; and George Eliot in Love (2010). “It’s a cliché, but my mother really was a writing machine,” Bruno Maddox said by e-mail. “Usually the first sound I heard when I woke up, because it had woken me, was her banging away, first on manual Olivettis and Royals – always the portable ones that folded up into a suitcase – then the IBM Selectric, the loudest typewriter ever invented, and finally on a standard Dell.” Brenda Lee Power Murphy was born Feb. 24, 1932, in Bridgewater, Mass., to Brendan and Edith (Giamperoli) Murphy. Her father was a doctor and her mother gave square-dancing lessons. After graduating from high school in Bridgewater, she received a scholarship to Radcliffe, graduating in 1955. Deciding to go into journalism, she was hired by The Patriot Ledger of Quincy, Mass., in 1957, “parlaying a single freshman semester of Harvard geology – the introductory course known fondly as “Rocks for Jocks” – into a position as science correspondent,” as her son put it. In 1958, at a science conference in Geneva, she met John Maddox, the science correspondent for the British newspaper The Manchester Guardian, who would later edit the journal Nature. They married two years later, and Ms. Maddox relocated to southwest London and became a freelance correspondent for The Economist. She later became its home affairs editor. Still later she worked for The Sunday Telegraph and The Times of London. Mr. Maddox, who died in 2009, had two children from a previous marriage, and in 1975, Ms. Maddox published a book about step-parenting, The Half-Parent. She tried her first biography in 1977, a portrait of Elizabeth Taylor, but the experience was off-putting. “I thought Taylor would be pleased to have the attentions of a serious journalist,” Ms. Maddox wrote in a 1999 essay in The New York Times. “She was not.” An aide to Ms. Taylor raised the possibility of legal headaches, she said, and people connected to the actress uniformly declined to talk. The experience, she wrote, left her “resolving never again to write the biography of a living person.” Her next biography was “Nora.” “Nora Barnacle is a reporter’s dream,” Ms. Maddox wrote in the book’s introduction, “an unexplored corner of the Joyce story. She has a legion of admirers, people, like me, who always wanted to know more.” In the 1999 New York Times essay, she expanded on the project’s origins. “There were tantalizing glimpses in Richard Ellmann’s great biography of Joyce, but no more,” she wrote. “Ellmann tried to ward me off. She was an uninteresting woman, he said, about whom there was little to say; besides, all her friends were dead, so the chances of getting new information were minimal. “But as a long-time journalist, I knew that real people leave real traces and that any life is interesting when looked at up close.” That life, she concluded, was reflected throughout James Joyce’s writings. “Literary archeologists will work for generations to tweezer out the hidden references to Nora,” she wrote in the book, adding, “They will never find them all, for only Joyce knew where they were buried.” The book was adapted into a 2000 movie, “Nora,” with Susan Lynch in the title role. Ms. Maddox’s portrait of Ms. Franklin was just as detailed and nuanced as “Nora,” avoiding the easy assumptions that had begun to be made about the overlooked scientist. “Rosalind Franklin has become a feminist icon,” she wrote in the prologue, “the Sylvia Plath of molecular biology, the woman whose gifts were sacrificed to the greater glory of the male. Yet this mythologizing, intended to be reparative, has done her no favours. There was far more to her complex, fruitful, vigorous life.” In addition to her son and daughter, Maddox is leaves a stepson, Piers Maddox; a stepdaughter, Imma Maddox; and three granddaughters. Ms. Maddox liked to say, “I write for money,” her son, who is also a writer, recalled. “This only came up at book readings, where inevitably some slow-talking oddball in the back row takes five minutes to ask you where you get your ideas,” he said. “She really had no patience for the mystical airs and graces some writers take on when describing their ‘process’ to Terry Gross,” the NPR interviewer. “She loved the job of writing,” he continued. “The pens, the notebooks, the Post-it notes, the sound of the keys, then drafts and galleys and a big party somewhere, then wake up and start another one.” "|"Brenda Maddox, biographer who revealed Joyce’s muse, dies at 87"|"2019-07-02T16:15:05-0400"|"obituary,Brenda Maddox,death,biographer,James Joyce,dementia,world news,Rosalind Franklin,DNA researcher,Nora: The Real Life of Molly Bloom,maddox,nora,life,biography,london", 
"494"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-huawei-founder-ren-zhengfei-denies-involvement-with-nortel-collapse/"|"Nathan VanderKlippe"|"As a Canadian technology giant neared collapse, its fast-rising Chinese competitor moved in, ready to buy what was left of the company it was about to trounce. Huawei was still a little-known Chinese manufacturer of communications equipment in 2009, when Nortel was in the midst of bankruptcy proceedings. Only later would Nortel’s former security adviser accuse Huawei of benefiting from years of Chinese hacking into the Canadian company’s systems and stealing confidential information. But sometime in Nortel’s final chapter, Huawei offered to take it over, the Chinese company’s founder, Ren Zhengfei, told The Globe and Mail in an interview. “I told Mike that I wanted to acquire Nortel,” Mr. Ren said, referring to Mike Zafirovski, the man who was then Nortel’s chief executive officer. The deal did not happen, Mr. Ren said, because Mr. Zafirovski “replied by saying that he wanted to be the controlling shareholder of Huawei,” Mr. Ren said. “Nortel was already going into bankruptcy, but they still insisted on taking a controlling stake in Huawei.” The Chinese executive recalled asking, “Where will you get the money?” Nortel filed for bankruptcy protection on Jan. 14, 2009. Mr. Zafirovski said “he could go out looking for money,” Mr. Ren recalled. “I said it’s impossible.” Mr. Zafirovski did not respond to multiple requests for comment. And it’s not clear whether any such takeover could have been approved. “I don’t think any approach from Huawei would have been taken very seriously. The U.S. government was too important as a customer,” said John Manley, the former Canadian deputy prime minister who also served on the Nortel board. Mr. Manley did not recall any specifics of a Huawei proposal. The idea that Huawei sought to acquire the collapsing remains of Nortel is also likely to be seen as bittersweet by those who lay blame for the disintegration of the Canadian telecommunications champion partly at the feet of Chinese intellectual property theft. Brian Shields, Nortel’s former security adviser, has said internet logs show hackers from China had access to Nortel’s systems for years, at a time Huawei was rapidly developing some similar products. Related: Huawei’s CEO has a message for Canada: Join us and prosper in the 5G future Nortel at its peak employed nearly 100,000 people, with annual revenues of US$30-billion. Huawei today employs 194,000 with revenue last year of US$107-billion. Mr. Ren’s account stands at odds with a report in the Ottawa Citizen, which detailed how in May of 2009 a group of former Nortel executives, with the help of former CEO Bill Owens, convinced executives at Huawei to make a minority investment in an operating company they had formed to buy up Nortel’s remaining assets. The idea died when Huawei’s board rejected it, the Citizen reported. Mr. Ren said discussions with Nortel did not progress far enough to settle on an acquisition price. Huawei eventually hired a number of former Nortel scientists, some of whom became key figures in the company’s Ottawa research facility, where it did some of the science that underpins its fifth-generation cellular network technology. When Nortel fell apart, Huawei recruited, Mr. Ren said. “Back then, Nortel didn’t have the technology we are talking about today; they only had talented people. When such talented people were out of work, it was just natural that they would find other jobs,” he said. “When Nortel collapsed, 3G had just started developing in the world. As the industry evolved from 3G to 4G, and then to 5G, those people also improved themselves during the process. What they have contributed to Huawei is what they had in their minds. It’s definitely not about intellectual property theft.” Mr. Ren denied that his company had anything to do with Nortel’s failure. “Nortel suffered and collapsed because the bubble economy burst,” he said.

"495"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-trumps-july-4th-tanks-ready-to-roll-2/"|"Michael D. Shear and Thomas Gibbons-Neff"|"Two M1 Abrams tanks from Georgia and several other armoured vehicles are sitting in a rail yard in southeast Washington, a few miles from the Lincoln Memorial, waiting to be displayed during the city’s Fourth of July celebration at President Donald Trump’s request. The presence of the tanks, which were first photographed Monday by The Associated Press, suggests that Trump has largely succeeded in turning the city’s annual Independence Day festivities into a salute to the U.S. military. A Defense Department official said the tanks were expected to be included in the July 4 events on the National Mall. The official was not authorized to discuss the issue publicly because the Pentagon has directed all questions about the event to the White House. A second department official said the Pentagon had been told explicitly not to discuss the planning, equipment or logistics for the event. Trump, who will be speaking Thursday evening from the Lincoln Memorial, has ordered flyovers by Air Force One and aircraft from each branch of the armed forces. If the Fourth of July event goes forward as planned, it will most likely cost the government tens of thousands of dollars in flight hours, aircraft maintenance, fuel and transport for the assorted military vehicles. The Navy’s Blue Angels will also perform over the National Mall, the National Park Service said. White House officials have said Trump’s speech is not intended to be political but rather an homage to the military and to the United States. Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, said: “The president loves America and wants to help all Americans celebrate our nation’s independence with a salute to America on the National Mall.” Trump’s remarks and the fireworks that will follow are free and open to the public. But the White House confirmed that a small section of the area in front of the Lincoln Memorial will be reserved for VIP guests, including members of the military, as well as their friends and family. Deere said the White House was in charge of distributing free tickets for that space but declined to provide details. An official at the Republican National Committee said Tuesday that the organization received “a small number” of tickets to distribute to the president’s supporters. The official said that was standard practice for White House events like the Christmas open house and garden tours in the fall and spring.

"496"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-macron-proposes-lagarde-to-head-ecb-in-push-to-end-eu-jobs-deadlock/"|"Lorne Cook Raf Casert"|"After three days of arduous negotiations, European Union leaders broke a deadlock Tuesday and nominated German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen to become the new president of the bloc’s powerful executive arm, the European Commission, one of two women named to top EU posts for the first time. In a series of tweets, European Council President Donald Tusk said that Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel would take over from him in the fall. Frenchwoman Christine Lagarde was proposed as president of the European Central Bank, while Spanish Foreign Minister Josep Borrell was nominated to become EU foreign policy chief, meaning he would be charged with supervising the Iran nuclear deal, among other duties. Only Mr. Michel can take up his post without other formalities. The others, notably Ms. von der Leyen – who will take over from Jean-Claude Juncker for the next five years – must be endorsed by the European Parliament. The assembly sits in Strasbourg, France, on Wednesday to elect its own new president and early signs suggest that lawmakers could contest the nominations. “It is important that we were able to decide with great unity today, and that is important because it’s about our future ability to work.” German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters after the nominations – decided away from the cameras and media in a long series of meetings – were made public. Several lawmakers have already objected to the leaders’ package of nominations, and it remains to be seen whether the parliament will flex new found muscles following the massive turnout for EU-wide elections in May. Party leaders have said the vote has brought the assembly – the EU’s only elected institution – even more democratic legitimacy. “This backroom stitch-up after days of talks is grotesque,” said Greens group leader Ska Keller, describing the nomination process as “party power games.” “After such a high turnout in the European elections and a real mandate for change, this is not what European citizens deserve,” said Ms. Keller, who is in the running to become parliament president on Wednesday. Mr. Juncker, who steps down on Oct. 31 as head of the commission, which proposes and enforces EU laws, conceded that “it won’t be easy in parliament.” Mr. Tusk said “it was worth waiting for such an outcome” and that he would do his best to explain to what could well be a tetchy parliament on Thursday how the nominations were made and what thought processes went into the move. “It’s always a huge question mark. This is why we have parliaments,” Mr. Tusk said, with a wry smile. Ms. Von der Leyen would be the first woman in the commission job, and Mr. Merkel said this is “a good sign.” So would Ms. Lagarde – currently chair of the International Monetary Fund – and she would serve for up to eight years if her nomination is endorsed. “That’s a very important statement that Europe leads on gender equality,” Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said. “It might have taken three days, but it’s a good outcome overall,” he told reporters. The nominations came after one of the longest summits in recent years, outstripping even all-night negotiations during the Greek debt crisis. Already plagued by crises such as Brexit and deep divisions among countries over how best to manage migration, the leaders had been keen to show that they could take quick decisions and that the European project remains important to its citizens. But they struggled to establish a delicate balance between population size and geography – an even mix of countries from the north and south, east and west, and ensure that at least two women were nominated. Mr. Tusk he said he hoped that someone from a central or eastern European member state would be voted in as president of the European Parliament. Despite deep tensions, some tantrums by leaders behind the scenes and even public criticism of his handling of the summit, Mr. Tusk said: “Five years ago, we needed three months to decide and still some leaders were against. This year it was three days and nobody was against.” The Belgian prime minister said that he understands the challenges that lie ahead. “The next five years will be very important for the future of the European project and I am convinced that it will be very important to protect and to promote our unity, our diversity and especially also our solidarity,” Mr. Michel told reporters, after one of the most acrimonious summits in recent memory.

"497"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-convoluted-battle-for-eu-posts-shows-there-has-to-be-a-more-democratic/"|"Eric Reguly"|"For anyone who thinks the European Union is in trouble, that it is a noble idea now reaching its expiry date, the allocation of the EU’s top jobs gives them another chance to say “I told you so.” The process was fraught, riven by infighting and power plays. Only on Tuesday night, European time, five weeks after the process started, did the winning slate of candidates emerge. The names were largely unexpected, an indication that compromise among EU leaders had forced out a few of the early big-name front-runners. Every five years, after the EU elections, which were held in May, the EU goes through the convoluted process of picking the leaders of its most powerful institutions. The Big Five positions are president of the European Commission (the EU’s executive arm, now held by Luxembourg’s Jean-Claude Juncker); president of the European Parliament (the only directly elected EU institution); president of the European Council (made up of the leaders of the EU’s 28 member states – 27 after Brexit); president of the European Central Bank (ECB); and High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (the EU’s foreign minister). Four of the five were picked by the EU leaders, leaving only the EU Parliament’s presidency unknown. The candidate for commission president was Ursula von der Leyen, Germany’s Defence Minister and long-time ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. If she is confirmed by the EU Parliament, she will become the first woman to run the commission. France’s Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, was the surprise nominee to lead the ECB, replacing Italy’s Mario Draghi; she is not an economist and the job normally goes to economists. The council elected Charles Michel, Belgium’s liberal Prime Minister, as its new president. Rounding out the package was Spanish socialist Josep Borrell Fontelles, a former president of the EU Parliament, who was nominated as the EU’s foreign minister. As the talks dragged on over the weeks, everyone grew frustrated, notably French President Emmanuel Macron. His own solution to the mess, concocted with Ms. Merkel, died a quick death. “Our credibility is profoundly tainted with these meetings that are too long and lead to nothing,” he said on Monday after overnight negotiations in Brussels that went nowhere. “We give an image of Europe that isn’t serious. We cannot hold talks with world leaders, in an ever more violent world, and be a club that meets at 28 [EU members] without ever deciding anything.” The selection of the EU leaders is not an exercise in democracy – EU citizens have no vote on the appointments. It is an exercise in backdoor deals, politely known as “compromise.” Since the beginning of the EU’s time, the negotiations have never been easy, but this year’s edition proved particularly strained. The exasperating talks in good part reflected the fragmented, almost warring, state of the EU. The EU parliamentary elections broke the old power balance between the centre-right and the centre-left political blocs, which dominated the legislature since elections were first held in 1979. The rising stars in the spring elections were the populist-nationalists, the Greens and the liberals, leaving no group with a majority. The illiberal democracies in the east, such as Hungary, had no interest in seeing pro-Europe, pro-migrant, free-trading liberals take the top posts. Populist, Euroskeptic Italy had no interest in seeing the traditional German-French axis divvy up the spoils, as it has almost always done. The centre-right European People’s Party (EPP), which remains the single biggest group in Parliament, couldn’t seem to accept that it’s a waning force and still insisted on having an outsized say in picking the winners. And so on. EU outsiders – and a huge portion of EU citizens themselves – always have trouble understanding the job-allocation show, which only increases the suspicions that the European Union is essentially dysfunctional. Ask anyone to explain the difference between the EU Commission, Council and Parliament and how they are involved in the job-picking process and you will get a blank stare. It’s hard to tell who is actually in charge of what in the EU. But here goes, in vastly simplified form. The European Council selects the candidates for the top jobs – the most powerful one being president of the European Commission – after which the nominees are approved by Parliament. But since 2014, the EU Parliament has insisted that the council pick the candidate for commission chief from the parliamentary group with the most seats, in this case the EPP. The convoluted process reinforced the Euroskeptic populist view that the EU is run by unelected elites, typically of the Western European variety (as each of Tuesday’s four names were) who don’t recognize that Europe’s political tectonic plates are shifting rather rapidly. The Brexiters, of course, held up the bedlam as evidence that Britain is better off without the EU. By Tuesday evening, the logjam was finally broken. Sheer weariness and frustration appeared to have produced names who are disliked by the fewest power brokers. An earlier near-agreement saw Ms. Merkel and Mr. Macron support Frans Timmermans, a Dutch social democrat, for commission president. Normally, Ms. Merkel would have endorsed a conservative from Parliament’s EPP bloc, but she appears to have supported Mr. Timmermans out of respect for Mr. Macron – another indication that her role as Europe’s most powerful politician is coming to an end. But many EU leaders, especially those from Eastern Europe, objected to Mr. Timmermans and his liberal values and he didn’t make the cut. The top jobs were filled because they had to be. But the whole gory process left many Europeans with the feeling that there has to be a better way to run the EU, one that comes with more democracy and transparency and less backroom horse-trading.

"498"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-fire-on-russian-navy-submersible-kills-14-sailors-military-says/"|"Vladimir Isachenkov"|"Fire broke out on one of the Russian navy’s deep-sea research submersibles, and toxic fumes from the blaze killed 14 sailors aboard, Russia’s Defence Ministry said on Tuesday, although it released few details about the disaster or the vessel involved. The Defence Ministry did not say how many sailors were aboard the vessel during Monday’s fire, whether there were any survivors or if it was submerged at the time. But Russian media reported it was the country’s most secret submersible, a nuclear-powered vessel designed for sensitive missions at great depths. President Vladimir Putin, who came under criticism for his handling of the Kursk nuclear submarine disaster in 2000 that killed 118 sailors, cancelled a scheduled appearance and immediately summoned Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu for a briefing on the blaze, which was under investigation. “Fourteen submariners have died of poisoning by fumes from the fire,” Mr. Shoigu told Mr. Putin during a televised meeting. “The fire was extinguished thanks to the crew’s resolute action.” Mr. Putin ordered Mr. Shoigu to fly to the Arctic port of Severomorsk, the main base for Russia’s Northern Fleet where the vessel was brought, to oversee the investigation and report back to him personally. “It’s a huge loss for the navy,” Mr. Putin said. “I offer my sincere condolences to the families of the victims.” He added that the vessel had a special mission and an elite crew. “It’s isn’t a regular vessel. It’s a research vessel with a highly professional crew,” Mr. Putin said, adding that seven of the dead had the rank of captain and two were awarded the country’s highest medal, the Hero of Russia. The fire occurred while the submersible was measuring sea depths in Russia’s territorial waters, the ministry said, adding that the vessel also is used for studying the seabed. Russia’s RBC online news outlet and the Novaya Gazeta newspaper identified it as the nuclear-powered AS-12 Losharik. The vessel is the most advanced Russian submersible, under a heavy veil of secrecy, and it is believed to have entered service in 2010. It is named after a Soviet-era animated cartoon horse that is made up of small spheres. The name is apparently derives from the unique design of its interior hull, which is made of titanium spheres capable of withstanding high pressure at great depths. In 2012, the Losharik was involved in research intended to prove Russia’s claim on the vast Arctic seabed. It collected samples from the depth of 2,500 metres, according to official statements at the time. Regular submarines can typically dive to depths of up to 600 metres. Some observers speculated the Losharik was even capable of going as deep as 6,000 metres, but the claims couldn’t be independently confirmed. Analysts suggested that one of its possible missions could be disrupting communication cables on the seabed. The Losharik is carried under the hull of a mother submarine, the nuclear-powered Orenburg, and reportedly has a crew of 25, all of them officers. Russian news reports said that while the Losharik officially belongs to the Northern Fleet, it answers directly to the Defence Ministry’s Department for Deep-Sea Research, reflecting the high sensitivity of its missions. The vessel has been surrounded by tight secrecy, but in 2015, it was accidentally caught on camera by a photographer from a motoring magazine doing a photo session on the White Sea coast. Igor Britanov, who commanded the Soviet K-219 nuclear submarine that suffered an explosion in one of its missile tubes in 1986 that killed four of its crew, was quoted as saying by Severpost news outlet that Monday’s blaze could have been caused by a short circuit or a flammable liquid getting into an air filter – the two most common causes of submarine fires. The Russian navy also uses simpler Priz-class and Bester-class deep water vehicles, which have a hull built of titanium and are capable of operating at a depth of 1,000 metres. The small vehicles have a crew of two and are primarily intended for rescuing submariners in case of incidents. Such vessels are transported to the area of operation by a carrier vessel and can operate autonomously for up to 120 hours. The blaze marks the most serious Russian naval disaster since 2008, when 20 crew members died aboard the nuclear-powered Nerpa submarine in the Pacific Fleet after a firefighting system was accidentally initiated while it was undergoing sea trials. The accident involving the Kursk was the worst naval disaster in post-Soviet Russia. It occurred on Aug. 12, 2000, when the nuclear submarine exploded and sank during manoeuvers in the Barents Sea, killing all 118 crew members. Putin, who was in his first year of his presidency, came under heavy criticism at the time when he failed to immediately interrupt his vacation to take charge of the disaster.

Police spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara said former defence secretary Hemasiri Fernando and Police Chief Pujith Jayasundara were arrested at hospitals where they had been admitted. They remain in the hospitals under police custody, he said. The arrests came a day after prosecutors asked police to explain why they had not arrested the two former senior officials despite being instructed to do so. The attorney-general’s department said in a letter to acting police chief C.D. Wickremaratne on Monday that it had ordered Mr. Fernando and Chief Jayasundara to be named as suspects and produced before a court because a presidential commission of inquiry found grounds to charge them with dereliction of duties and criminal negligence. The letter said crimes the officials are suspected of having committed fall within “grave crimes against humanity” under international law. Police had reportedly sought to question Mr. Fernando and Chief Jayasundara but did not because they had been admitted to hospitals. Mr. Fernando resigned after the blasts and Chief Jayasundara was sent on compulsory leave. Since the April 21 suicide attacks, the government has acknowledged it received intelligence reports about the plot beforehand but failed to act on them. Both Mr. Fernando and Chief Jayasundara appeared before a parliamentary committee inquiring into the blasts and described the security failures. President Maithripala Sirisena, however, opposed the parliamentary committee conducting a separate inquiry while court cases were being heard on the blasts. Mr. Fernando told the committee that Mr. Sirisena wasn’t easily accessible for discussions. Chief Jayasundara said Mr. Sirisena asked him after the blasts to resign to take responsibility and promised he would have his name cleared in any subsequent inquiry. Chief Jayasundara also said Mr. Sirisena had asked him not to attend National Security Council meetings since last October, when Mr. Sirisena fired Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in a power struggle that triggered a seven-week political crisis. Mr. Wickremesinghe was subsequently reinstated by the Supreme Court.

At least 21 people were killed and more than 60 others injured when a 10-metre wall demarcating an urban forest collapsed during the night in Mumbai, police officer Ravinder Howle said. Rescue teams with sniffer dogs were searching the area afterward, and rescuers from the Indian navy also fanned out to help and rescue residents of the waterlogged city, India’s financial and entertainment capital. Nine deaths were caused by two wall collapses elsewhere in Maharashtra state. Six migrant construction workers were killed and five injured when a wall collapsed on their tin-roofed huts in Pune early Tuesday, an officer in the city’s Police Control Room said. In Thane district, a school wall collapsed and fell onto huts, killing three people and injuring one, said Lakshman Pawar, a local civic official. A 45-year-old watchman died when a wall collapsed on him late Monday night, police said. Mr. Howle said two men died after they were trapped in a submerged car, raising the overall death toll in the state to 33. The monsoon season in India brings heavy rains from June to September that cause flooding and other damage. Building collapses are common as the rains weaken the foundations of poorly built structures. On Saturday, another wall collapse in Pune killed 16 people living in a cluster of tin-roofed huts housing migrant workers and their families. Monday’s rains also flooded roads in Mumbai and covered train tracks. According to Skymet, a private weather forecasting agency, the rainfall was the city’s heaviest in a decade and second-highest in 44 years. Rains subsided by midday Tuesday, but weather officials predicted more heavy precipitation in the next three days. India’s Central Railway said in a tweet that “nature’s fury” made operating trains a “safety hazard” in some areas. Train services were running only partially on Tuesday after thousands of passengers were stranded overnight. Millions of passengers commute daily on a network of famed railways in Mumbai. The city has witnessed incessant rainfall over the past few days and flood waters have entered homes. A public holiday was declared for Tuesday and the Maharashtra government said only emergency services would be functional. Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis tweeted: “People are advised to stay indoors unless there is any emergency.” TV channels showed videos of submerged cars and water flowing through ground floors of some residential buildings. A domestic flight skidded off the main runway at the Mumbai airport late Monday night, and flight operations were partially restored on Tuesday. At least 50 domestic and international flights were diverted and 50 other flights were cancelled.

"501"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-china-backs-hong-kong-chief-saying-occupation-vandalizing-of/"|"Johnson Lai"|"China’s government strongly backed Hong Kong’s beleaguered administration on Tuesday, saying pro-democracy protesters who occupied and vandalized the city’s legislature committed “serious illegal acts” that endangered the social order. Chinese state media broadcast video of police in Hong Kong clearing protesters from the streets earlier in the day in a break with their silence over days of demonstrations that have challenged Beijing’s authority over the semi-autonomous Chinese territory. Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Beijing condemned the acts that saw several hundred demonstrators smash through glass and steel barriers to enter the building on Monday night, defacing portraits of lawmakers and spray-painting pro-democracy slogans in the chamber. China’s central government voiced support for Hong Kong’s Chief Executive Carrie Lam and the city’s police force in dealing with the incident in accordance with law, Mr. Geng said. “The violent attacks … are serious illegal acts that trample on the rule of law and endanger social order. We strongly condemn it,” Mr. Geng told reporters at a daily briefing. He also reiterated China’s rejection of any foreign country commenting on or intervening in protest actions in Hong Kong, saying such matters were a purely Chinese affair and other countries “must not support any violent criminals in any form, and not send any misleading signals or take any erroneous actions.” His comments follow the publication of an editorial by a ruling Chinese Communist Party newspaper that said the demonstrators who broke into the local legislature showed their “arrogance” and had no regard for the rule of law. Speaking in Hong Kong, U.S. Consul General Kurt Tong criticized violence among government critics but said all should have the right to express their views peacefully, including foreign residents with long-standing ties to the Asian financial hub. Hong Kong has been through a “tough time” over recent months, but the intentions of those seeking to effect change were good and the territory has “the right ideas and the right values,” Mr. Tong said. The United States feels “we have a legitimate voice to express our concerns about issues of politics or governance or economic policy or the like,” he said. “And so, we certainly don’t view that as an interference. Nobody has to listen to our comments if they don’t want to, but we feel like we’re within bounds by expressing ourselves.” Beijing has largely sought to play down the demonstrations that have highlighted doubts about the validity of its “one country, two systems” formula for governing the former British colony. Its coverage of the protests and the publication of a harsh editorial in the official Communist Party newspaper Global Times may indicate it is prepared to take a tougher line against the demonstrators. “These violent assailants in their arrogance pay no heed to Hong Kong’s law, no doubt arousing the anger and sadness of all people of the city of Hong Kong,” the editorial said. Veteran opposition figure Joshua Wong acknowledged that the damage to the legislative offices has drawn criticism from some sectors in Hong Kong. But he said huge marches and rallies in previous weeks showed there was a groundswell of support for the demonstrators’ goals of demanding more accountability from Lam’s administration. “I understand people in Hong Kong and around the world might not 100-per-cent agree or disagree on all of the behaviour of protesters … but all of the requests have been ignored. So is there any way out?” Mr. Wong said. Ms. Lam is “not capable as leader anymore” and should resign, Mr. Wong said, echoing the demand of many protesters. Having been elected by a Beijing-approved committee, Ms. Lam is reliant on continuing support from Beijing, which has shown no outward signs of abandoning her. Mr. Wong also alleged that police officers had “double standards” in enforcing the law, saying pro-Beijing lawmakers and their staff have gotten better treatment than their opposition counterparts in the weeks of protest outside the legislature. On the mainland, Beijing had sought to suppress news of the protests, which roughly coincided with celebrations of the 22nd anniversary of Hong Kong’s handover from British to Chinese rule. The demonstrations reflect mounting frustration with Ms. Lam and her government for not responding to demands from opposition figures that were originally sparked by a government attempt to change extradition laws to allow suspects to be sent to China for trial. Ms. Lam has shelved the bills but not agreed to scrap them altogether as opponents insist. Protesters whacked away at thick glass windows until they shattered and then pried open steel security gates before they swarmed into the legislature and vandalized it. Many wore yellow and white helmets, face masks and the black T-shirts that have become their uniform. Police initially retreated as the protesters entered, avoiding a confrontation and giving them the run of the building. The protesters later vacated it as riot police cleared surrounding streets with tear gas and then moved inside. The actions prompted organizers of a separate peaceful march against the extradition bill to change the endpoint of their protest from the legislature to a nearby park, after police asked them to call it off or change the route. Police wanted the march to end earlier in Hong Kong’s Wan Chai district, but organizers said that would leave out many people who planned to join the march along the way. Police estimated that 190,000 people joined the peaceful march, the third major one in as many weeks. Organizers put the turnout at 550,000. The extradition proposal has heightened fears of eroding freedoms in Hong Kong, which Britain returned to China on July 1, 1997. Debate on the measure has been suspended indefinitely. Protesters want the bills withdrawn and Ms. Lam to resign. Ms. Lam, who has come under withering criticism for trying to push the legislation through, called a rare predawn news conference with security officials on Tuesday at police headquarters. She noted that two different protests happened on Monday – one a generally orderly march that reflected Hong Kong’s inclusiveness, the other using vandalism and violence. “This is something we should seriously condemn,” she said. Ms. Lam disputed protesters’ complaints that officials had not responded to them, saying the government explained that by suspending the bill with no timetable or plan to revisit it, the legislation would die at the end of the current legislative session in July, 2020. For the other demands, she said releasing arrested protesters without an investigation would not uphold the rule of law. The extradition bill has given fresh momentum to Hong Kong’s pro-democracy opposition movement, awakening broader concerns that China is chipping away at the rights guaranteed to Hong Kong for 50 years. The two marches in June drew more than one million people, according to organizer estimates. Surveying damage to the legislature, legislative council president Andrew Leung said the violence had undermined “the core values of Hong Kong.” He said police were collecting evidence of criminal wrongdoing. “I believe many Hong Kong people will share the same feeling with me that we are saddened by what happened last night. For the best interest of Hong Kong, I hope that all of us can find the way forward professionally,” Mr. Leung said. While the extradition bills and police use of tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters have drawn concern from professional groups and foreign governments, the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong said it supported Ms. Lam’s government in condemning the violence at the legislature. “We believe the violent protests of recent days do not reflect how the majority of people in this dynamic and advanced economy would choose to be heard,” the chamber said in a statement.

"502"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-ukraines-actor-turned-president-makes-his-debut-in-toronto-to-an/"|"Doug Saunders"|"From a distance, he’s a fairy-tale figure: Last year, he was an actor starring in a TV comedy series about an ordinary guy who becomes leader of his country; then this April, in a surprise turn of events, he was elected President of his country, Ukraine, on an anti-corruption agenda. On Tuesday, politicians from around the world got their first up-close look at Volodymyr Zelensky in Toronto, where the 41-year-old comedian-turned-President attended a high-level conference on Ukrainian economic and political reform hosted by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland. Mr. Zelensky impressed foreign ministers and senior bureaucrats with his frankly reformist rhetoric and his quick wit – he joked about his lack of affinity with the Toronto Raptors and twice quoted the wisdom of Ukrainian-Canadian icon Wayne Gretzky. He reiterated promises to bring Ukraine to the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. But behind the scenes, you could sense a hesitancy toward this largely unknown man who has pledged to bring his country closer to a Western world that no longer agrees on the best approach to Ukraine. “I think the sincerity is there, but frankly, a lot of the people I speak to here feel that he hasn’t shown a lot of substance and wonder if he can live up to his words," said Paul Grod, the Canadian businessman who is president of the Ukrainian World Congress and has briefed Mr. Zelensky on international relations. “The real question they’re asking is, who is he? Is he really his own man? Is there anyone in the background pulling his strings? I think this meeting was important to make sure he’s getting the advice he needs.” Mr. Trudeau and Ms. Freeland made some modest new pledges of support to Ukraine, whose military confrontation with Moscow, after Russian troops occupied Crimea and began attacks on eastern Ukraine in 2014 has left it beleaguered. They promised an additional $45-million in development aid and policing assistance, as well as a pledge that Canada would not admit anyone trying to enter the county on Russian passports issued to residents of Russian-occupied Crimea and eastern Ukraine and a recommitment to provide armaments and military support. But behind the scenes, Canadian officials were more hesitant. Beyond those cold feet, there has been a distancing by many Western countries from wholehearted support of Ukraine since the heady days of 2014, when Ukraine’s fate was seen then as a stark choice between eventual integration into the EU and NATO, or an alliance with Russia – a view that was reinforced by Russia’s invasion. Today, European countries are divided over how to approach Ukraine. German officials said they do not want to see Ukraine on a pathway to EU or NATO membership at all – citing worries about expanding an already unstable 28-country bloc and concerns about aggravating Russia further by expanding Western-dominated military presence to its borders. French and Dutch officials have expressed similar views. On the other hand, foreign ministers from central and Eastern Europe said on Tuesday that they strongly support Ukraine’s path toward membership. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto told The Globe and Mail that his government wants to see Ukraine in the EU if its citizens so choose, even though Hungarian President Viktor Orban often expresses opposition to the EU and its powers. So Mr. Zelensky, even if he is successful in his anti-corruption reforms, might have trouble fulfilling his pledge to bring his country closer to a Europe that can’t agree on whether to accept it. “There is a problem that Europe is facing some identity crises of its own, independent of Ukraine," said Kurt Volker, the U.S. State Department’s Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations. “You have nationalist populist parties rising up, concern [about] immigration or unemployment or religion or identity or whatever it might be. And the U.K. is leaving the EU. So there are a lot of identity crises in the EU, which makes it hard for them to think about future membership for anybody.” As he and other observers see it, Mr. Zelensky will have to make his country look more appealing to countries that have become wary of its economic inefficiency and corruption. “If you ask investors in the West if they believe Ukraine is going to stay stable, the answer is, ‘We’re not certain,’” said David Lipton, a deputy director of the International Monetary Fund. “Corruption has done terrible things to hold the Ukrainian economy back.” That’s why Canadians and other officials are taking a hesitant approach: So many investments in Ukraine have disappeared into a fog of corruption that they want to see real reforms first, before any discussions of a greater role for Ukraine can begin Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day’s most important headlines.

"503"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-us-president-trump-pressures-opec-to-embrace-russias-vladimir/"|"Bozorgmehr Sharafedin"|"When Vladimir Putin announced at the weekend that OPEC would extend oil production cuts, broadcasting a deal before the group had even met to approve it, the move angered some member nations. They were dismayed at the leading role non-OPEC Russia, once seen as an enemy in oil markets, was playing in shaping the group’s policies. But reality soon set in, and the acceptance that Moscow could help OPEC in its goal of propping up oil prices at a time when it is facing intensifying heat on another front: from U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump is putting unprecedented pressure on OPEC and its de-facto leader Saudi Arabia, demanding they pump more crude to drive down fuel prices - a key domestic issue for him as he seeks re-election next year. Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh initially expressed outrage about Russian President Putin’s pre-announcement of the extended output cuts. “OPEC is going to die with these processes,” he declared on Monday morning, before OPEC oil ministers met to effectively rubber-stamp a done deal, bemoaning the Russia-Saudi dominance of the group’s affairs. But by Monday evening, he had thrown his support behind the deal: “The meeting was good for Iran and we achieved what we wanted.” OPEC and Russia have become unlikely bedfellows, forging an “OPEC+” alliance to reduce global crude supply to counter soaring output from the United States and a weakening world economy. It is a marriage of convenience as both want higher oil prices to shore up their finances, while the alliance could also strengthen OPEC’s position in the face of Trump’s demands. “I don’t think Russia is calling the shots,” said Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih when asked if Putin was now OPEC’s boss. “I think Russia’s influence is welcome.” Iran’s veteran OPEC governor Hossein Kazempour Ardebili concurred, echoing his boss Zanganeh’s conciliatory tone. “Russia is a big player. If it announced something in agreement with the rest of OPEC, this is most welcome,” he said. “We are working together.” Iraq, which has overtaken Iran as OPEC’s second-largest producer after Saudi Arabia and has taken its market share in Europe and Asia, also said Moscow’s rising role was positive. Such a chorus of approval is a sharp reversal for relations between OPEC and Russia that have been characterised by antipathy and distrust for decades. Back in 2001, Russia agreed to cut production in tandem with OPEC but never delivered on its pledges and instead raised output. That severely damaged relations, and other attempts at cooperation were unsuccessful - until the recent alliance. In his book “Out of the Desert”, former Saudi Oil Minister Ali al Naimi wrote that his 2014 meeting with Russian officials lasted just minutes. Upon learning Russia would not cut output, he gathered his papers and said: “I think the meeting is over.” Putin announced on Saturday that he had met Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on the sidelines of a G20 meeting in Osaka and they had agreed to extend the OPEC+ production cuts. Gary Ross, chief executive of Black Gold Investors, said that even if it was “indelicate” for Saudi Arabia to let Putin announce the deal, it showed the changing oil market dynamics. “Trump has one interest – low oil prices. Putin wants higher prices,” said Ross, a veteran OPEC watcher. “Putin is vitally important for OPEC. And it is still in Russia’s best interest to cooperate with OPEC as half its budget comes from energy revenues.” Russia needs prices of $45-50 a barrel to balance its budget and its finances are stretched by U.S. sanctions imposed following its annexation of Crimea. Saudi Arabia needs an even higher price of $80. Benchmark Brent crude is currently in the region of $65 a barrel. But just as the collaboration could lend Saudi Arabia some support against Trump, who has demanded Riyadh increase oil supply if it wants U.S. military support in its standoff with regional rival Iran, it also gives Putin more than extra revenues. Good relations with Riyadh, an American ally, bolsters Moscow’s clout in the Middle East, helps Putin’s campaign in Syria and might even help mend relations with Washington, according to two sources in Russia’s delegation to Vienna, where OPEC officials have been meeting. Highlighting those intersecting roles, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak also serves as head of several Russian government commissions on trade and cooperation including with Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey and Qatar. Iran’s change in tone, in particular, illustrates the conflicting political and economic pressures it faces. Tehran’s falling production, due to U.S. sanctions reimposed and extended by Trump, has reduced its role within OPEC while increasing those of Saudi Arabia and non-OPEC Russia. Iran’s exports plummeted to 0.3 million barrels per day in June from as much as 2.5 million bpd in April 2018. Oil output in OPEC’s exempt nations: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Fx7Lcc But Iran is itself also looking to help from Russia, one of just a few countries that has offered to aid Tehran to counter the sanctions choking its oil trade and hammering its economy. Two Russian energy industry sources said some work was being done to boost the Iranian economy but talks were slow and difficult, without giving details of the nature of the plans.

"504"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-hong-kong-protests-beijings-tightening-grip-rattle-business/"|"Vimvam Tong"|"Chaotic scenes of protesters rampaging through Hong Kong’s legislature, trashing furniture and daubing graffiti over walls have sent jitters through the business community, which worries about the impact on the city’s status as a financial hub. Plumes of smoke billowed among gleaming sky-scrapers early on Tuesday as police fired tear gas to disperse protesters in the heart of the city, home to the offices of some of the world’s biggest companies, including global bank HSBC. Escalating unrest over a controversial extradition bill, which would allow people to be sent to mainland China for trial, grabbed global headlines and clouded Hong Kong’s outlook as a finance hub, one of the city’s main pillars of growth. “I think there will be damage to the reputation of Hong Kong,” said Yumi Yung, 35, who works in Hong Kong’s fintech sector. “Some companies may want to leave Hong Kong, or at least not have their headquarters here.” Around 1,500 multinational companies make Hong Kong their Asian home because of its stability and rule of law. Some of the biggest and most violent protests in decades could change that perception. Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula that allows freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China, including freedom to protest and an independent judiciary. Beijing denies interfering but, for many Hong Kong residents, the extradition bill is the latest step in a relentless march towards mainland control. Many fear it would put them at the mercy of courts controlled by the Communist Party where human rights are not guaranteed. “If this bill is not completely scrapped, I will have no choice but to leave my home, Hong Kong,” said Steve, a British lawyer who has worked in Hong Kong for 30 years. Others raised concerns about the future of human rights and the territory’s judiciary. Many did not want to use their full names. “To me, the biggest worry is how Hong Kong is losing its independence bit by bit and is getting dangerously close to a country that doesn’t value human rights and that doesn’t have an independent judicial system,” said Edward, an Australian citizen who has worked in the financial sector for 10 years. The extradition bill has also spooked some Hong Kong tycoons into starting to move their personal wealth offshore, according to financial advisers familiar with the details. An Australian businesswoman who has worked in Hong Kong for 16 years lamented what she saw as Beijing’s tightening grip. “China is just taking away more and more freedom from Hong Kong,” she said. “I feel sorry for Hong Kong people, especially Hong Kong people … (here) for more freedom, a better economy, a better life, and now it’s going backwards,” the woman said. Such concerns came as China’s top newspaper warned on Wednesday that outbreaks of lawlessness could damage Hong Kong’s reputation and seriously hurt its economy. While calm has returned for now, the events of recent weeks have set many people thinking. “If it had escalated, I would consider moving elsewhere,” a 44-year-old hedge fund manager said of the ransacking of the city’s legislature. “I employ four to five people in Hong Kong so yes, I would consider moving.” "|"Hong Kong’s business community shaken as China tightens its grip"|"2019-07-03T01:52:39-0400"|"international,hong kong,extradition bill,protests,financial hub,China,Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule,one country,two systems,business,economy,hong,kong,Hong Kong,city", 
"505"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-airstrike-kills-40-migrants-in-tripoli-detention-centre-libyan/"|"Rami Musa And Samy Magdy"|"An air strike hit a detention centre for migrants near the Libyan capital early Wednesday, killing at least 44 people and wounding more than 130, the U.N. mission to the war-torn country said. The air strike raises further concerns about the European Union’s policy of partnering with Libyan militias to prevent migrants from crossing the Mediterranean, which often leaves them at the mercy of brutal traffickers or stranded insqualid detention centres near the front lines. It could also lead to greater Western pressure on Khalifa Hifter, a Libyan general whose forces launched an offensive on Tripoli in April. The Tripoli-based government blamed his self-styled Libyan National Army for the air strike and called for the U.N. to investigate. A spokesman for Hifter’s forces did not immediately answer phone calls and messages seeking comment. Local media reported the LNA had launched air strikes against a militia camp near the detention centre in Tripoli’s Tajoura neighbourhood. Footage circulating online and said to be from inside the migrant detention centre showed blood and body parts mixed with rubble and migrants’ belongings. The air strike hit a workshop housing weapons and vehicles and an adjacent hangar where around 150 migrants were being held, mostly Sudanese and Moroccans, according to two migrants who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. The migrants said three or four survived unharmed and about 20 were wounded. They said the rest were killed, indicating the final death toll could be much higher. Doctors Without Borders said the detention cell that was destroyed held 126 migrants. The aid group’s Libya medical co-ordinator, Prince Alfani, said teams visited the centre just hours before the air strike. He said survivors fear for their lives, and he called for the immediate evacuation of the detention centres. The U.N. refugee agency also condemned the air strike and called for an immediate end to efforts to return migrants to Libya. UNHCR spokesman Charlie Yaxley noted that the agency had warned less than two months ago that anyone inside the Tajoura detention centre was at risk of being caught in the fighting around Tripoli. Then, an air strike that hit nearby wounded two migrants. Yaxley said UNHCR is sending medical teams to the site after the latest air strike. The head of the African Union, Moussa Faki Mahamat, also condemned the strike. He called for an independent investigation and said those responsible for the “horrific crime” should be held to account. The LNA launched an offensive against the weak Tripoli-based government in April. Hifter’s forces control much of Libya’s east and south but suffered a significant blow last week when militias allied with the Tripoli government reclaimed the strategic town of Gharyan, about 100 kilometres (62 miles) from the capital. Gharyan had been a key LNA supply route. Hifter’s forces have targeted militia positions in Tajoura with air strikes in recent weeks. The LNA said Monday it had begun an air campaign on rival forces in Tripoli after it lost control of Gharyan. Hifter’s forces boast MiG fighter jets supplied by neighbouring Egypt, as well as drones, attack helicopters and mine-resistant vehicles. It was not immediately clear what munitions were used in the air strike early Wednesday. Oded Berkowitz, a security analyst focused on the Libyan conflict, said Hifter’s LNA flies “a handful of obsolete aircraft” that are “in poor condition.” He said it has received spare parts from Egypt and possibly Russia, as well as decommissioned aircraft from both countries. “Egypt and the UAE have been conducting air operations on behalf of the LNA, but there are no indications that the UAE transferred aircraft to the LNA,” he said. Fathi Bashagha, the interior minister in the Tripoli-based government, claimed that foreign countries allied with Hifter were behind the attack. He told The Associated Press that Hifter’s foreign backers “went mad” after his forces lost Gharyan. He did not name any countries or provide evidence to support his claim. He also denied any weapons were being stored at the detention facility. The fighting for Tripoli has threatened to plunge Libya into another bout of violence on the scale of the 2011 conflict that ousted long-time dictator Moammar Gadhafi and led to his death. Hifter says he is determined to restore stability to the North African country. He is backed by Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia while his rivals, mainly Islamists, are supported by Turkey and Qatar. His campaign against Islamic militants across Libya since 2014 won him growing international support from world leaders who are concerned that Libya has become a haven for armed groups and a major conduit for migrants bound for Europe. His opponents, however, view him as an aspiring autocrat and fear a return to one-man rule. Libya became a major crossing point for migrants to Europe after Gadhafi’s overthrow, when the North African nation was thrown into chaos, armed militias proliferated and central authority fell apart. At least 6,000 migrants from Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, Sudan and other nations are locked in dozens of detention facilities in Libya run by militias accused of torture and other abuses. Most of the migrants were apprehended by European Union-funded and -trained Libyan coast guards while trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea to Europe. The detention centres have limited food and other supplies for the migrants, who often end up there after arduous journeys at the mercy of abusive traffickers who hold them for ransom money from families back home. The U.N. refugee agency has said that more than 3,000 migrants are in danger because they are held in detention centres close to the front lines.

"506"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-one-of-japans-biggest-warships-offers-clue-to-military-ambitions/"|"Emily Wang"|"One of Japan’s largest warships, the helicopter carrier Izumo, offers a glimpse of where its military is headed: For the first time, troops from a newly formed amphibious brigade of Japan’s army participated in an extended naval deployment. The Izumo left Subic, a former U.S. naval base in the Philippines, at the end of a two-month deployment in the Indo-Pacific region at a time of prolonged tensions involving China’s sweeping territorial claims in and around the South China Sea. The carrier, along with the destroyers Murasame and Akebono, just finished a series of drills with the United States and other countries. Island nation Japan’s ability to project military power beyond its borders is severely constrained by the commitment to pacifism and rejection of use of military force in conflict enshrined in its post-Second World War constitution, though in 2015 it was reinterpreted to allow the use of force in defending itself and its allies. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has made amending the constitution to allow the military greater leeway one of his lifetime goals. President Donald Trump has sought to help that cause, calling repeatedly for Japan to do more to defend itself under its alliance with the U.S. In May, Japan conducted its first quadrilateral exercise with France, the U.S. and Australia in the Bay of Bengal. France deployed its flagship nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, the FS Charles de Gaulle, while the United States sent a missile destroyer, the William P Lawrence. Other drills have included Canada, India, Malaysia, Vietnam, Brunei and the Philippines. Japan is preparing to reconfigure the Izumo to accommodate U.S. stealth fighters, including F-35Bs, after announcing it would purchase 42 of its own. The aircraft are designed to operate with short takeoffs and vertical landings, such as on carriers. The purchase underscores Japan’s growing role in its postwar alliance with the U.S. “In order to incorporate what was not originally in the design, or something new that had not even been thought of, I think this would require research into many areas, otherwise it wouldn’t go well,” said Capt. Katsuyoshi Motoyama, the Izumo’s commanding officer. Yasukazu Tanaka of the Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade, similar to the U.S. Marines, said the recent exercises were meant to deepen co-ordination between them and ground troops to facilitate use of the carrier for transporting troops to front lines in the future. Since the Izumo can accommodate both air and sea transport, “there are great possibilities for us to conduct amphibious operations,” he said, though he and all others involved emphasized that the ground and marine troops conducted no joint exercises. Ground troops are still exploring how best to operate on longer missions, where regulations limit use of live-fire weapons on board. Troops practised emergency first aid response and trained on the flight deck and in the aircraft carrier hangar deck, at times using guns made of rubber in battle scenarios. China has been expanding its military presence to press home its determination to defend its claim to virtually the entire South China Sea in the face of challenges by the U.S. and its allies, unnerving many in the region. The Defence Ministry says Japan’s air force scrambled fighter jets 999 times in 2018, the second highest number since it began defending its airspace in 1958. Of that number, 64 per cent were responses to Chinese aircraft. The U.S. Navy and others have angered Beijing by repeatedly sailing their ships close to Chinese-occupied islands to assert what they say is the right to freedom of navigation. Beijing also has installed advanced weapons systems at several disputed locations, including seven islands it built by piling sand and concrete on top of coral atolls. Some of those sites are now equipped with airstrips, radar and missile stations, expanding China’s ability to monitor and potentially control activity by other militaries in the region. So far, encounters have been peaceful, but all sides are concerned about the potential for miscalculations that could spark conflict. During its five-day voyage from Brunei to the Philippines, Izumo skirted near the so-called “nine-dash line” marking China’s territorial claims while conducting its last few exercises with navies from Brunei and the Philippines. Japan’s navy also hosted a training program for young representatives from Southeast Asian nations, with lectures on international maritime law, humanitarian and disaster relief programs, and exercises in navigation and communications. Most participants were officers in their 20s and 30s. “Especially with the territorial and boundaries part, I think that would be vital information for us,” said Muhammad Danial bin Matyussof, a junior lieutenant in the Brunei navy. “We have neighbouring boundaries with Malaysia and Vietnam, so it could provide insight every time we do patrols.” While the backdrop of the exercises was evident, given China’s rising profile, “This Indo-Pacific deployment is not an operation that is aimed at any one specific country,” said Hiroshi Egawa, commander of Escort Flotilla One.

"507"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-russias-defence-minister-says-some-crew-members-survived-fire-on-navy/"|"Vladimir Isachenkov"|"Some crew members have survived a fire that killed 14 sailors onboard one of the Russian navy’s deep-sea research submersibles, the nation’s defence minister said Wednesday. Sergei Shoigu didn’t specify how many crew members were rescued from Monday’s fire. Speaking at the navy’s Arctic base of Severomorsk, he praised the vessel’s crew for “heroic” action, saying they sacrificed their lives to rescue a civilian expert and save the ship after the fire erupted. Details were scarce about the incident on the ship, which was on a mission to measure sea depths in Russia’s territorial waters in the Barents Sea. The Defence Ministry said the seamen were killed by toxic fumes from the blaze, but did not specify how many crew members were aboard. The ministry didn’t name the vessel, but Russian media reported it was the country’s most secret submersible, a nuclear-powered research submarine called the Losharik intended for sensitive missions at great depths. Few images and details have emerged about the vessel. In 2012, the Losharik was involved in research intended to prove Russia’s claim on the vast Arctic seabed. It collected samples from a depth of 2,500 metres (8,202 feet), according to official statements at the time. Regular submarines can typically dive only to depths of up to 600 metres (2,000 feet). President Vladimir Putin, who summoned Shoigu Tuesday to report on the fire, said in televised comments that seven of the dead had the rank of captain and two had been awarded the nation’s highest medal, the Hero of Russia. “It’s a huge loss for the navy,” Putin said. Russian media on Wednesday identified some of the victims, including the ship’s captain, Denis Dolonskiy, who was awarded the Hero of Russia medal for the 2012 Arctic seabed research mission. Shoigu, speaking during a meeting with officials investigating the fire, said those who died were “high professionals” and “unique experts.” “The submariners acted heroically in the critical situation,” he said. “They evacuated a civilian expert from the compartment that was engulfed by fire and shut the door to prevent the fire from spreading further and fought for the ship’s survival until the end.” Viktor Murakhovsky, a well-connected military expert, told Russian state television that the accident happened while the ship was at the depth of 300 metres (984 feet.) He said the victims included two sons of Russian navy admirals. Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov refused to say whether the vessel was nuclear-powered or answer any questions about its name, design and mission, saying that the information is confidential. In an e-mail to The Associated Press, Synne Egset from the Norwegian Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority said Wednesday that it “had not had confirmation or denial that it was a nuclear submarine.” She added that the accident would have no implications for human beings or wildlife. A Vatican spokesman said Pope Francis has been informed of the fire and “expresses his condolences and closeness to the families and the victims affected by the disaster.” Putin is set to visit the Vatican Thursday for a meeting with the pope. The blaze marks the most serious Russian naval accident since 2008, when 20 crew members died aboard the nuclear-powered Nerpa submarine in the Pacific Fleet when a firefighting system was accidentally initiated. The Losharik is named after a Soviet-era animated cartoon horse made up of small spheres – a reference to the unique design of its interior hull, reportedly made of a chain of titanium spheres capable of withstanding colossal pressure at great depths. Media reports speculated that it likely has features similar to the U.S. deep submergence vessel, the NR-1, which was mothballed in 2008 after nearly 40 years of service. But unlike the NR-1 that was designed to dive to 910 metres (3,000 feet), the Losharik was built to go far deeper. Some observers speculated the Losharik was even capable of going as deep as 6,000 metres (19,685 feet), but the claims couldn’t be independently confirmed. Analysts suggested that one of its possible missions could be disrupting communication cables on the seabed. In Russia’s worst submarine disaster, the Kursk nuclear submarine suffered an explosion and sank during naval manoeuvres in the Barents Sea on Aug. 12, 2000, killing all 118 crew members. Putin, who was in his first year of his presidency, came under heavy criticism at the time when he failed to immediately interrupt his vacation to handle the catastrophe.

"508"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-putin-signs-bill-suspending-russias-participation-in-nuclear-arms/"|""|"President Vladimir Putin has signed a bill suspending Russia’s participation in a pivotal nuclear arms treaty. Putin’s decree, released on Wednesday, formalizes Russia’s departure from the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty with the United States following Washington’s withdrawal from the pact. The U.S. gave notice of its intention to withdraw from the INF in February, setting the stage for it to terminate in six months unless Moscow returns to compliance. Russia has denied any breaches, and accused the U.S. of violating the pact. Moscow followed Washington’s example in February, also suspending its obligations under the treaty. The INF treaty, signed by U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, banned production, testing and deployment of land-based cruise and ballistic missiles with a range of 500 to 5,500 kilometres (310 to 3,410 miles). The intermediate-range weapons were seen as particularly destabilizing as they take a shorter time to reach their targets compared to the intercontinental ballistic missiles. That would leave practically no time for decision-makers, raising the likelihood of a global nuclear conflict over a false launch warning. Putin has vowed that Russia will not be the first to deploy new intermediate-range missiles and warned the U.S. against deploying new missiles in Europe, saying that Russia will retaliate by fielding new fast weapons that will take just as little time to reach their targets.

"509"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-italian-socialist-lawmaker-david-sassoli-elected-president-of-eu/"|"Francesco Guarascio Daphne Psaledakis"|"European Union governments’ surprise nominee for president of their executive, Germany’s Ursula von der Leyen, sought support in the bloc’s parliament on Wednesday, hoping to secure the confirmation she will need in two weeks’ time. Under a deal reached by the 28 member governments on Tuesday after long and fraught negotiations, Von der Leyen, an ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, will replace Jean-Claude Juncker as head of the EU’s executive Commission. France’s Christine Lagarde will head the European Central Bank. Leaders hope the decision to put two women at the top of EU decision-making for the first time will send a positive message and repair damage to the bloc’s image wrought by such a fractious summit, diplomats said. The discord echoed a wider fracturing of the EU’s political centre evident in May’s elections to the European Parliament, which delivered a more fragmented assembly with bigger far-right and far-left contingents. “In the end, we’ve got a package that found unanimity and that’s a very important achievement,” said a senior EU diplomat, who asked not to be named. “It’s the eternal compromise, but that’s how we work … The parliament will make its peace with it. They’ll huff and puff, as they do. But they’ll back it in the end.” Yet the selection wrangles could portend difficulties ahead for Von der Leyen, currently German defence minister, as she tries to marshal a strong and united EU response to issues from global warming and Brexit to trade wrangling with Washington and Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Von der Leyen needs to be confirmed in her new job by an absolute majority of the 751 EU lawmakers. “I decided that my very first stop would be here in Strasbourg to meet the European Parliament … because here is where the heart of the European democracy is beating,” she told reporters at the legislature. She said her hope was to nurture “intensive co-operation” between the European Commission, European Council of national leaders, and European Parliament over her five-year term. On paper, Von der Leyen ought to be able to secure those votes comfortably, but she may hit resistance in an assembly aggrieved that EU leaders ignored the lead candidates from the main parliamentary blocs – the “Spitzenkandidaten” – in their horse-trading over top posts. The parliament did, however, get its wish on Wednesday to choose its own preferred candidate as speaker for the next 2-1/2 years, something that may smooth ruffled feathers. Italian socialist David Sassoli, a 63-year-old former journalist who has served for 10 years as an EU lawmaker, was elected after two rounds of voting. The Socialist and Green groupings had been particularly upset at Von der Leyen’s nomination. “This backroom stitch-up after days of talks is grotesque, it satisfies no one but party power games,” said Greens leader Ska Keller. The Socialists’ leader in the assembly, Spain’s Iratxe Garcia, called the agreement “deeply disappointing.” They were mostly angered by east European leaders’ rejection of socialist Frans Timmermans as Commission head, a move that many saw as retaliation against his accusations of civil rights violations in Hungary and Poland. Von der Leyen can, however, rely on the support of the main centre-right and liberal groupings. Another conservative group led by Poland’s ruling PiS party also looks set to back her. Most Italian lawmakers, although eurosceptic, are also likely to support Von der Leyen, after Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte welcomed the deal on her nomination. This would give her enough votes to be endorsed, even without the backing of the socialists. Under the deal reached by the EU leaders, and backed by conservatives, the centre-right will have the presidency of the parliament in the second half of the five-year legislature. While a gender balance has been maintained in choosing the EU’s top posts, the East-West balance has been neglected, with no eastern European designated for a top position.

"510"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-china-hits-back-at-british-criticism-over-hong-kong-protests/"|"Johnson Lai"|"Police said they have arrested at least 13 people during Monday’s pro-democracy protests, including one man accused of storming into Hong Kong’s legislature building in a break-in involving hundreds of protesters who vandalized offices and the main chamber. The local man, surnamed Poon, was arrested in Mong Kok for assaulting police, criminal destruction, misconduct in public places and forced entry of the Legislative Council Complex, police said late Wednesday night. The 12 others, including 11 men and one woman, were arrested in connection with a different protest that took place Monday morning. They face various charges including possession of offensive weapons, unlawful assembly, assaulting a police officer, obstructing a police officer and failing to carry an identity document. The brief statement did not describe the offensive weapons or provide further details. Pro-democracy protesters rushed police barricades around the time of a morning flag-raising ceremony marking the 22nd anniversary of the return of Hong Kong, a former British colony, to China on July 1, 1997. Police used shields, batons and pepper spray to drive them back. That afternoon, protesters began what became an hours-long effort to break into the locked legislature building by smashing thick glass walls and prying open metal security curtains. A few hundred poured in around 9 p.m. and spray-painted slogans on the walls and caused extensive damage. On Wednesday, workers boarded up shattered windows and police carted away evidence during the start of what will be a massive cleanup and criminal investigation. The government showed journalists the extent of the damage on a tour of the first two floors of the building. At almost every turn, slogans had been spray-painted on the walls in Chinese and English. “Destroy the Chinese Communist Party,” one read. “Hong Kong is not China” another said. Papers, garbage and umbrellas – a protest symbol in Hong Kong used to ward off sun, rain and pepper spray – were strewn in lobbies and rooms. Parts of wooden picture frames were all that remained of portraits of legislative leaders that hung on the wall. In scenes that shocked people in Hong Kong and around the world, the protesters vented their anger and frustration in the legislature Monday at a government that hasn’t responded to their demands. Once inside, they stood on the desks in the main chamber and climbed high to cover the city’s official emblem with black spray paint. The actions overshadowed a peaceful march by hundreds of thousands of pro-democracy protesters elsewhere in the city. Steve Vickers, a former head of criminal intelligence for the Royal Hong Kong Police, predicted a severe government crackdown that will result in long jail terms. “I am personally sympathetic to the great majority of the Hong Kong demonstrators and their motivation, but the hardcore elements and agitators involved are becoming increasingly desperate,” said Mr. Vickers, who heads Steve Vickers & Associates, a political and corporate risk consultancy. “Their actions are counterproductive to many Hong Kong peoples’ genuine democratic aspirations.” Police also announced two other sets of arrests Wednesday. They said five men and one woman were arrested for various incidents during a public meeting on Sunday, when supporters of police staged a large rally. Some clashed with anti-government protesters and members of the news media. They were charged with possession of offensive weapons, assault causing bodily harm, common assault and fighting in a public place. Also on Wednesday, police said eight people had been arrested for posting personal data about police officers on the internet as massive protests against the government and police were held in recent weeks. Officers and their family members have been threatened since their addresses and official ID card numbers were published, Superintendent Mohammed Swalikh of the Cyber Security bureau said. He did not say whether police believe the disclosures were related to the protests. Six men and two women were arrested. Protests against a legislative proposal expanded to target the police, as well, after officers used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds blocking major city streets on June 12. Dozens were injured in the clashes, both protesters and police. Protesters are demanding an independent investigation into the crackdown, which was harsher than usual for Hong Kong. Police have said it was justified after some protesters turned violent. The legislative proposal would have allowed criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China to face trial. Opponents saw it as an erosion of the rights guaranteed to Hong Kong for 50 years after the return of the former British colony to China in 1997, and part of a broader attempt by China to clamp down on dissent in the semi-autonomous territory. Hundreds of thousands marched in the largest protests in recent memory. Smaller protests blocked the legislature and major streets. The government eventually gave in, suspending debate on the bill, but protesters still want the legislation formally withdrawn and the resignation of Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam. In Beijing, the Chinese government lashed back at remarks by British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt on the causes of the anti-government protests in Hong Kong. Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Mr. Hunt appeared to be “basking in the faded glory of British colonialism and obsessed with lecturing others.” Mr. Hunt had said that Hong Kong authorities should not use an outbreak of vandalism in the legislative chambers by protesters Monday night as a “pretext for repression.” He said the authorities need to “understand the root causes of what happened, which is a deep-seated concern by people in Hong Kong that their basic freedoms are under attack.” Protesters broke into the legislature’s building, spray-painting slogans on the walls, knocking over filing cabinets and strewing papers and smashing portraits of legislative leaders. Under a 1984 agreement between Britain and China, Hong Kong is to retain its Western-style economic, legal and political system for 50 years. But Mr. Geng said Britain has no authority to discuss matters in the territory. China considers such criticism to be interference in its internal affairs. Mr. Geng said that Britain restricted Hong Kong’s democracy during the colonial era. Hong Kong was under British rule for 155 years, during which it was run by a series of governors appointed by the British crown. The protesters in Hong Kong are demanding direct election of the city’s leader. “The U.K. considers itself as a guardian, which is nothing but a delusion,” Mr. Geng said. “It is just shameless to say that Hong Kong’s freedoms are negotiated for them by the British side.” China’s central government has voiced strong support for Ms. Lam and the city’s police in dealing with the recent protests.

"511"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-alabama-district-attorney-drops-charges-against-woman-who-lost-fetus/"|""|"An Alabama district attorney said Wednesday she is dropping the manslaughter charge against a woman who lost her fetus when she was shot during a fight. Marshae Jones was arrested last week after a grand jury concluded she intentionally caused the death of her fetus by initiating a fight, knowing she was pregnant. Jones was five months pregnant when 23-year-old Ebony Jemison shot her in the stomach during a December argument over the fetus’ father, authorities said. Jemison was initially charged with manslaughter, but a Jefferson County grand jury declined to indict her after police said an investigation determined Jones started the fight, and Jemison ultimately fired in self-defence. Jones, 28, was indicted by the same grand jury and arrested. But Jefferson County Bessemer Cutoff District Attorney Lynneice O. Washington said Wednesday that she would not pursue the case. “After reviewing the facts of this case and the applicable state law, I have determined that it is not in the best interest of justice to pursue prosecution of Ms. Jones,” Washington said, flanked by her chief assistant and local church leaders. “There are no winners, only losers, in this sad ordeal.” The prosecutor did not take questions or explain the process that led to grand jurors returning the indictment to begin with. Lawyers representing Jones said they were pleased with Washington’s decision and urged Jones’ supporters to direct their energy to “ensuring that what happened to Marshae won’t ever happen again.” Jones’ lawyers filed a motion to dismiss Monday morning, arguing that in issuing the charges, the state used a “flawed and twisted rationale” that “ignores the law and ignores reason.” The idea that Jones intentionally caused the death of her fetus by initiating the fight is a “tortured,” ”irrational“ theory which ”defies the most basic logic and analysis,“ the filing asserts. Alabama is one of dozens of states that have fetal homicide laws allowing criminal charges when fetuses are killed in violent acts, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Jones’ arrest sparked outrage across the country, with advocates for women’s rights calling it another attempt to charge women for crimes related to their pregnancies. Legal scholars said the arrest raised questions about what other scenarios — such as driving a car or swimming in a pool — could constitute putting a fetus in danger. Lynn Paltrow, executive director of National Advocates for Pregnant Women, said she’s pleased to see the case dismissed but noted it would be a mistake to see it as an outlier. “We hope there are no more cases like this in the future, but our experience in 40 years of cases suggests that we will see many more such misuses of the law in the name of fetal personhood in the future,” Paltrow said. The case arose after Alabama passed the nation’s most hardline anti-abortion legislation. The new law makes performing an abortion at any stage of pregnancy a felony punishable by 10 to 99 years or life in prison for the provider. The law makes no exception for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest.

"512"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-pricier-grills-but-cheaper-meat-how-trumps-trade-policies-have/"|"Barbara Smith"|"U.S. consumers likely paid more for grills to cook their Independence Day hot dogs and burgers this year because of the U.S.-China trade war, but they will find some consolation in less costly meat for cookouts as tariffs curb U.S. exports. The tit-for-tat tariff fight between the world’s two largest economies started by U.S. President Donald Trump a year ago has U.S. companies facing higher costs for metals and components, while U.S. agricultural exports to China have fallen off. Grill manufacturers such as RH Peterson Co, which owns high-end brands Fire Magic Grills and American Outdoor Grill, said they were struggling with higher prices for raw materials like steel as well as Chinese-made components of their products. “It’s something that has been very harmful for our operations,” said Joe Valencia, purchasing manager at RH Peterson. While the company absorbed some of the costs, it has raised prices on grills by almost 10% this year - more than the normal seasonal increase of 1% to 4% each summer, said Jerry Scott, senior vice president of sales. Fourth of July meats are bountiful in U.S. grocery stores after U.S. farmers increased production and trade disputes limited some exports. At a Kroger Co-owned Mariano’s grocery store in Chicago, customers enjoyed “Buy one, get one free” steak specials and $3.99 burgers this week. “I actually did notice that meat was cheaper this year,” said Donald Denna, a Mariano’s customer. “We normally cook chicken on the Fourth of July, but this year I got steak.” Lean ground beef used in hamburgers costs $4.52, down from $4.65 last year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Boneless New York strip steak costs $8.64 a pound, down from $9.75 a year ago. “Ongoing trade disputes that constrain market access and/or result in elevated tariffs ultimately reduce the volume and value of U.S. meat exports,” said Glynn Tonsor, an agricultural economist at Kansas State University. Pork spareribs for the grill cost $2.07 a pound, up slightly from $2.04 a year ago. Pork prices have increased as an outbreak of a fatal hog disease in China has fueled expectations for increased U.S. exports by companies such as Tyson Foods Inc despite a 62% tariff on U.S. pork in China. U.S. pork exports to China and Hong Kong, the No. 2 buyers of U.S. pork before the trade war, were down 16% this year through April and also fell to top-buyer Mexico as the Trump administration renegotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement, according to the U.S. Meat Export Federation. Beef exports to China fell 34% to 30,242 metric tons. China is not a major buyer of U.S. beef but imposed a 25% retaliatory tariff on imports last year. Large U.S. supplies of beef and pork are keeping a lid on chicken prices too. The trade war has roiled global markets, with varying consequences for consumers. Futures prices for Midwest hot-rolled coil steel,, one type of metal used in grills, have fallen this week to $525, below record highs from May 2018 when Trump applied broad tariffs on global steel imports but well above their five-year low of $364 in December 2015. It could have been worse. The U.S. government recently postponed the introduction of tariffs on $300 billion worth of products, a list that included all Chinese-made grills, after Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in Japan last month. Of the grills sold in the United States, 90% are imported and most larger chains such as Home Depot Inc and Lowe’s Companies Inc buy their products straight from Chinese suppliers. Another piece of good news - fireworks, a July 4 staple, were also included on the list of Chinese products slated to have 25% tariffs levied on them in July. But those tariffs were also postponed.

"513"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-us-taliban-scramble-to-rewrite-draft-agreement-outlining-troop/"|"Kathy Gannon"|"Taliban and U.S. negotiators are scrambling to rewrite a draft agreement that will outline the withdrawal of American and NATO troops from Afghanistan and a verifiable Taliban guarantee to fight terrorism ahead of an all-Afghan peace conference Sunday. Officials familiar with the talks, but not authorized to speak about them, say negotiations went late into the night on Wednesday and were to resume again on Thursday – the sixth day of direct talks between the insurgents and U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad. Suhail Shaheen, spokesman for the Taliban’s political office in Qatar, told The Associated Press on Thursday that “the talks are continuing and they will continue tomorrow as well. We have made some progress.” Previously he said that a draft agreement was being rewritten to include agreed-upon clauses. On Thursday he said the two sides had broadened their discussion, without elaborating. Until now, the two sides had been divided on the withdrawal timetable, with the United States seeking more time. Taliban officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, earlier said the U.S. was seeking up to 18 months to complete a troop withdrawal even as U.S. President Donald Trump told Fox News earlier this week that a withdrawal had already quietly begun and that troop strength had been cut to 9,000. The president’s statement has since been contradicted by a senior U.S. official, who said the force strength is unchanged at about 14,000. Still, Trump’s statements reinforced the president’s often stated desire to leave Afghanistan and end America’s 18-year war – the longest in his country’s history. His eagerness to pull out has strengthened the position of the Taliban, who effectively control half the country and won a key concession in the planning of the upcoming peace gathering, which will include no official delegation from the Afghan government. Germany and Qatar, who are co-sponsoring the dialogue and issuing the invitations, said participants will attend “only in their personal capacity,” a condition President Ashraf Ghani has strenuously opposed. He has made no comment on Sunday’s meeting. The Taliban have steadfastly refused to talk to Ghani’s government, calling it a U.S. puppet, but have said government officials can attend the conference as private citizens. In a tweet on Wednesday, Shaheen said 60 people will attend the peace gathering, which Khalilzad called an “essential element” in achieving a peace agreement in Afghanistan. Atta-ul-Rahman Salim, deputy head of a government-appointed peace council, said the delegation from Kabul will include a cross-section of Afghanistan’s civil society, including women’s rights activists. “It is a good first step to hear each other’s side,” he said. Former Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who attended two previous meetings with the Taliban in Moscow, told The Associated Press he won’t be attending the Doha gathering because he will be in China. But, he added, “I fully support the coming intra-Afghan dialogue in Doha and am in the picture.” Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day’s most important headlines.

"514"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-putin-confirms-fire-hit-russian-submarine-was-nuclear-powered/"|"Andrew Osborn Andrey Kuzmin"|"Russian President Vladimir Putin disclosed on Thursday for the first time that a secret military submarine hit by a fatal fire three days ago was nuclear-powered, prompting the defence minister to assure him its reactor had been safely contained. Russian officials have faced accusations of trying to cover up the full details of the accident that killed 14 sailors as they were carrying out what the defence ministry called a survey of the sea floor near the Arctic. Moscow’s slow release of information about the incident has drawn comparisons with the opaque way the Soviet Union handled the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear power station disaster, and another deadly submarine accident – the 2000 sinking of the nuclear-powered Kursk, which claimed 118 lives. Russia, which says the details of the submarine involved in the latest accident are classified, said the fire took place on Monday, though it was only officially disclosed late on Tuesday. Until Thursday there was also no official word on whether the vessel had a nuclear reactor, despite strong interest from neighbouring Norway. Putin revealed that the submarine had been nuclear-powered by asking Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu during a Kremlin meeting about the reactor’s condition after the fire. “The nuclear reactor on the vessel is completely isolated,” Shoigu told Putin, according to a Kremlin transcript. “All the necessary measures were taken by the crew to protect the reactor, which is in complete working order.” The fire erupted in the submarine’s battery compartment, Shoigu added, and later spread. Although the Kremlin publicized the meeting on Thursday morning, it was not immediately clear when the men had met. “There has not been any formal communication from Russia to us about this,” Per Strand, a director at the Norwegian Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority, told Reuters when asked if it had been informed that the submarine was nuclear-powered. “We understand they brought the situation under control quickly, under difficult conditions, and there was, as such, no nuclear incident that they were obligated to tell us about. “Still, we would have been happy to have been informed of such incidents,” he added. Russian servicemen attended a memorial service on Thursday in the port city of Kronstadt near St Petersburg in honour of the 14 dead submariners. Held in the hulking Russian Orthodox Naval Cathedral of St Nicholas, sailors cradled lit candles and looked on as priests read out prayers and a choir chanted in the background. Shoigu, a close Putin ally, told the president that the submarine, which authorities said had been operating in the Barents Sea area, would be fully repaired. “Right now, we are assessing how long it will take, how much work there is, and how we can carry it out,” he said. Shoigu’s ministry has released photographs of the deceased sailors, hailing them as “real patriots of the Motherland.” Separately, a photograph of a tribute to them circulated on social media which appeared to have been hung on the wall of a Russian military facility. Reuters could not immediately confirm its authenticity, but it said the men had served on board a deep-sea submersible known by the designation AS-31. Russian media have previously reported, without official confirmation, that the vessel was designated as either AS-31 or AS-12 and is designed to carry out special operations at depths where regular submarines cannot operate. The submarine is made up of a series of interconnected spheres that allow it to resist water pressure at great depths. Western military experts have suggested it is capable of probing and possibly even severing undersea communications cables. Putin ordered Shoigu to prepare posthumous state awards for the dead submariners. An official investigation into the accident, likely to be shrouded in secrecy, is already under way.

Commission spokeswoman Jacqueline Ann De Guia said the agency was investigating the death of Myka Ulpina in a gun battle sparked by an undercover police raid Sunday in Rodriguez town in Rizal province, east of Manila. Officials have relieved 20 police officers amid the investigation. “Myka Ulpina’s life was cut short in the hands of those who swore to protect it,” the commission said in a statement, stressing that it “condemns the death of another innocent life as a consequence of the government’s war against illegal drugs.” More than 6,600 suspects, mostly petty drug dealers and users, have been killed since President Rodrigo Duterte took office in mid-2016 and expanded a brutal anti-drug campaign he started when he was a southern city mayor. Despite international condemnation and two complaints for alleged mass murder filed before the International Criminal Court, Duterte has warned that the drug war will become more dangerous in the final three years of his presidency. He said he was ready to go to jail as a consequence of the bloody campaign. Police said the drug suspect, Renato Dolorfina, grew suspicious of an undercover police officer who was buying prohibited drugs from him. He got a gun from his house and shot the officer, sparking a firefight which left Dolorfina, his daughter, his companion and the officer dead. News reports, however, quoted Dolorfina’s wife as denying the police report and saying they were sleeping when police barged into their house and opened fire. National police chief Gen. Oscar Albayalde said he ordered the relief of 20 Rodriguez town policemen, including their chief, and had them surrender their firearms for ballistic tests to determine who fired the bullet that hit the child. Albayalde said the suspect should have surrendered peacefully to keep his daughter away from harm and cited initial reports that Dolorfina may have used her as a human shield during the exchange of fire. The slain officer, Senior Master Sgt. Conrad Cabigao, left two children, he said. The Commission on Human Rights said it supports efforts to end the drug menace in the country “but we continue to echo the sentiment that the end does not justify the means.” “Minors caught in the crossfire of the government’s initiative in combatting illegal drugs in the country are simply not collateral damages. They are victims. Their hopes and dreams fall short once bullets enter their bodies,” said the commission, which Duterte has repeatedly denounced along with UN human rights rapporteurs for raising alarm over his anti-drug campaign.

"516"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-australian-student-missing-in-north-korea-is-released/"|"Eugene Hoshiko Emily Wang"|"An Australian student released after a week in detention in North Korea arrived in Tokyo on Thursday after telling reporters he was in “very good” condition, without saying what happened to him. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced to Parliament that Alek Sigley, 29, had been released following intervention from Swedish diplomats and had been taken to the Australian Embassy in Beijing. Later Thursday, Sigley flew to Tokyo’s Haneda airport to reunite with his Japanese wife. He walked past reporters there without making any comments. Earlier, at Beijing’s airport, he gave a peace sign and said “I’m OK, I’m OK, I’m good. I’m very good,” but did not respond to reporters’ questions about what had happened in Pyongyang. His father, Gary Sigley, a professor of Asian studies at the University of Western Australia, said his son had been treated well in North Korea. It was a much happier outcome than the case of American college student Otto Warmbier, who was imprisoned in North Korea and convicted of attempting to steal a propaganda poster. Warmbier died shortly after being sent back home to the U.S. in a vegetative state in June 2017. Sigley’s friend and fellow student of North Korea, University of Technology Sydney academic Bronwen Dalton, said she had spoken to Sigley’s wife, who was thrilled by his release. “We were jumping up and down and we love Sweden,” Dalton said. “He’s a fine, young, emerging Asian scholar, he is very applied to his studies. I really doubted whether he did actually anything wrong by the regime,” Dalton added. Swedish diplomats had raised concerns about Sigley with North Korean authorities in Pyongyang, where Australia does not have an embassy. “Swedish authorities advised the Australian government that they met with senior officials from the DPRK yesterday and raised the issue of Alek’s disappearance on Australia’s behalf,” Morrison said, using the official acronym for North Korea. “This outcome demonstrates the value of discrete behind-the-scenes work of officials in resolving complex and sensitive consular cases in close partnership with other governments,” Morrison said. In an interview with Swedish public radio, Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom said the country’s special envoy to North Korea, Kent Harstedt, “raised the issue of this case at highest level” in North Korea and the release happened during his visit there. North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency said the Swedish delegation led by Harstedt headed back home on Thursday after a four-day visit. It said the Swedes visited a stamp museum and shoe factory during their stay in North Korea, but made no mention of Sigley. The Pyongyang university student and tour guide had been out of contact with family and friends in Japan and Australia since Tuesday last week. He had been active on social media about his experiences in North Korea and had boasted about the extraordinary freedom he had been allowed as one of the few foreign students living in Pyongyang. Morrison’s announcement was the first confirmation that he had been detained. Morrison said he discussed Sigley’s disappearance with other world leaders attending the Group of 20 summit in Japan last week and accepted offers to find out what happened to him. Morrison dined with President Donald Trump in Osaka but declined to say with whom he discussed Sigley’s disappearance. North Korea has been accused in the past of detaining Westerners and using them as political pawns to gain concessions. Leonid Petrov, an Australian National University expert on North Korea and a friend of Sigley, last week speculated that Sigley had been “deliberately cut off from means of communications” temporarily because Trump was in the region. Petrov said on Thursday that he had not been able to contact Sigley since he had been freed, but still suspected his disappearance was linked to Trump’s meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un on Sunday. “It was a time of sensitivity in North Korea after the visit of (Chinese President) Xi Jinping and before the visit by Donald Trump,” Petrov said. “I expected this to happen a couple of days earlier, but it was a good thing to see the Swedish government delegation arrive on Monday just after the summit. It was the right time to be there,” Petrov added. Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day’s most important headlines.

Tehran said the surveillance drone had been shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile in Iranian airspace, while Washington said it had been in international airspace. Tension has spiked between Tehran and Washington since last year, when Trump quit a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six powers and reimposed sanctions that had been lifted under the pact in return for Tehran curbing its sensitive nuclear work. Under the deal, Iran can enrich uranium to 3.67 per cent fissile material, well below the 20 per cent it was reaching before the deal, and the roughly 90 per cent suitable for a nuclear weapon. In reaction to U.S. sanctions, which have notably targeted its main foreign revenue stream in the shape of crude oil exports, Iran said in May that it would scale back its commitments to the deal. In its first major breach of the nuclear pact, Tehran said on Monday that it had amassed more low-enriched uranium than permitted. It said on Wednesday that it would boost its uranium enrichment after July 7 to whatever levels it needs beyond the cap set in the agreement. Trump responded: “Be careful with the threats, Iran. They can come back to bite you like nobody has been bitten before.” But in defiance of that warning, Tehran said it would stick to its plan to further scale back its nuclear commitments. “By exiting the nuclear deal, Trump has wounded the path of diplomacy … the best antidote to all threats is active resistance,” said Keyvan Khosravi, spokesman for Iran’s Supreme National Security Council. The European Union has urged Iran to stick to the terms of the deal, but Tehran has said its commitment will gradually decrease until Britain, France and Germany can ensure that it benefits financially from the accord – Iran’s main incentive for signing up to it. Since May, Washington has ordered all countries to stop purchasing Iranian oil or be banished from the global financial system. It has also dispatched extra troops to the region to counter what it describes as Iranian threats.

"518"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-putin-meets-with-pope-francis-italian-leaders-during-one-day-visit-to/"|"Giada Zampano"|"Russian President Vladimir Putin met with Pope Francis for “substantive talks” at the Vatican Thursday, and thanked the pontiff for discussions on a range of topics including Ukraine and the Catholic Church in Russia. Francis received Putin in an hour-long audience at the Vatican Apostolic Palace. The two addressed “various questions of relevance to the life of the Catholic Church in Russia,” the Vatican said in a statement, adding that they also discussed “the ecological question and various themes relating to current international affairs, with particular reference to Syria, Ukraine and Venezuela.” The pair also expressed their satisfaction at the development of bilateral relations during the “cordial discussions,” the Vatican said. “Thank you for the time you have dedicated to me,” Putin told Francis. “It was a very substantive, interesting discussion,” he told journalists present at the exchange of gifts in the private papal study. The meeting, part of Putin’s one-day visit to Rome, comes a day before Catholic leaders from Ukraine gather at the Holy See to discuss the continuing conflict there and the fallout from the schism between the Russian and Ukrainian Orthodox Churches. The Vatican said the aim is to lend support “in the delicate situation in which Ukraine finds itself.” Last year, the Orthodox Church of Ukraine formally split from the Russian Orthodox Church in a schism recognized by the spiritual leader of the world’s Orthodox Christians. The push for a full-fledged and independent Ukrainian Orthodox Church was bolstered by fighting in eastern Ukraine between government forces and Russia-backed rebels. Some observers believe that Putin’s visit could be a prelude to a papal visit to Russia. No pope has ever set foot in Russia, but Putin’s foreign affairs adviser said the issue wasn’t on the agenda for the visit. Putin later met with Italian President Sergio Mattarella and Prime Minister Giuseppe Fonte. The bilateral meetings will be followed by a Russia-Italy forum with Conte and Italian Foreign Minister Enzo Moavero. Putin will also meet privately with a long-time friend, former Premier Silvio Berlusconi, before returning to Moscow. Deputy Premier Matteo Salvini, who has made no secret of his admiration for Putin, will attend a dinner with Putin at Villa Madama. The two met face-to-face in Milan during Putin’s visit in 2014, in Salvini’s role as leader of the then-Northern League. “The League and its leader Salvini are active supporters of a restoration of full co-operation between Russia and Italy. They have spoken for a quicker abolition of anti-Russia sanctions introduced by the U.S. and EU. Here our points of view are aligned,” Putin said. Putin has acknowledged that U.S. and European Union sanctions have cost Russia an estimated $50-billion since 2014, but he claims that the bloc’s nations have suffered even greater damage because of the restrictions. The Russian president, on his first visit to Italy in four years, said in written responses to Italian daily Il Corriere della Sera that Moscow didn’t want to extend countermeasures against EU sanctions to Italy, but that it couldn’t react selectively within the World Trade Organization. Putin said that economic relations with Italy, Russia’s fifth-largest trading partner, are expanding despite the sanctions. Italian investments in Russia so far this year have reached $4.7-billion, while Russian investments in Italy in the same period were $2.7-billion.

"519"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-eighty-two-migrants-missing-at-sea-after-boat-from-libya-capsizes-in/"|"Maggie Michael Lori Hinnant"|"A boat from Libya carrying 86 migrants sank in the Mediterranean and left only three survivors, authorities said Thursday, after an air strike on a detention centre near the Libyan capital killed dozens of others. The twin tragedies illustrate the almost unthinkable choice facing those who have reached the North Africa coast while seeking a better life in Europe: Risk a hazardous sea voyage in a flimsy, rubber-sided boat, or face being crammed into a detention centre, where some of the migrants say they have been forced to assemble weapons for someone else’s war. “I fled from the war, to come to this hell of Libya,” said one teenager from sub-Saharan Africa who suffered minor injuries in Tuesday night’s air strike near Tripoli. “My days are dark here.” The International Organization for Migration said the boat sank late Wednesday off the Tunisian city of Zarzis and 82 of the migrants who had been on board were missing. Fishermen pulled four men from the water, and one died overnight, said Lorena Lando, the agency’s head in Tunisia, said. The boat, which had sailed from the Libyan port of Zuwara, was carrying twice as many people as should have been aboard, said Chamseddine Merzoug, a Tunisian Red Crescent volunteer in an interview via Skype. The United Nations and aid groups blame the deaths in part on the European Union’s policy of partnering with militias in war-torn Libya to prevent migrants from trying to cross the sea, saying the policy leaves migrants at the mercy of brutal traffickers or confined in detention facilities near front lines, often without adequate food and water. Migrants who survived the air strike said they were conscripted by a militia to work in a weapons workshop at the Tajoura detention centre, which had been the focus of a U.N. warning in May after an earlier air strike hit 100 metres (yards) away. The wounded teenager said he fled war in his homeland at the age of 14, seeking to join fellow nationals who made it to Europe in rickety boats. But his journey was riddled with torture and abuse. By the time he reached the coast, Europe was no longer so welcoming and he was caught by the EU-funded Libyan coast guard and spent 20 months in the detention centre. For the last eight months, he laboured without pay in the workshop adjacent to a hangar housing dozens of migrants, cleaning the militia’s weapons, from rifles to anti-aircraft guns, said the youth, who refused to give his name or nationality for fear of reprisal from the militias. When the U.N. or other aid agencies visit, migrants told The Associated Press, the militia hid the weapons. The decision to store weapons at the facility in Tajoura, east of Tripoli, may have made it a target for the self-styled Libyan National Army, which is at war with an array of militias allied with a weak, U.N.-recognized government in the capital. The Tripoli government has blamed the LNA and its foreign backers for the air strike, which killed at least 44 and wounded more than 130. The LNA, led by Field Marshal Khalifa Hifter, says it targeted a nearby militia position and denies striking the hangar where the migrants were being held. U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said the attack might amount to a war crime. Hifter, whose forces control much of eastern and southern Libya, has received support from Egypt, France, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Russia. Many of those who died in the attack were crushed under debris as they slept. Pictures shared by the migrants show the hangar reduced to rubble littered with body parts. More than 48 hours afterward, relief workers were still removing bodies while the wounded lay on bloody mattresses in a courtyard, receiving medical aid. The teen was sleeping when the munitions fell, obliterating the workshop and knocking him unconscious. “When I woke up, I found myself inside the hospital,” he said. But the injuries to his back and leg were relatively minor and on Thursday he was back at Tajoura, along with hundreds of others who survived the air strike. There are no plans as yet to evacuate them. In the aftermath of the air strike, several of the detainees told visiting aid workers that guards fired on them as they tried to escape. A group of 29 migrants from Eritrea and Somalia were relocated Thursday by the U.N. refugee agency from a detention centre in the town of Gharyan, about 100 kilometres (62 miles) south of Tripoli, where they had been held for months, the group said. Gharyan was the scene of fighting last week and conditions at the detention centre were dire, the UNHCR said, adding that the migrants were released to the community. Nearly at the same time as the bombs hit near Tripoli, a man speaking English made a call for help from off the coast of the Libyan city of Zawiya. He was with at least 60 people, a third of them women and children, and their boat was taking on water quickly, according to the call log from Alarm Phone, an aid group that takes emergency phone calls from the Mediterranean. He said the passengers are afraid of dying, and the boat is sinking quickly, but he could see the lights of the town still twinkling in the distance. The responder said their best hope was the Libyan coast guard but he needed to give a GPS location. “I only have a little phone,” he replied. The coast guard never went out that night. On Thursday, the U.N. migration agency confirmed a boat sank off the Tunisian coast, maybe 100 kilometres (60 miles) away, with 86 people on board. Only three survivors were found. It was not immediately clear if that the boat was the source of the phone call, or if Thursday had brought yet another tragedy from Libya. Also on Thursday, the Italian humanitarian group Mediterranea Saving Humans said one of its sailboats has rescued 54 migrants about 65 nautical miles north of Libya. The rescue went ahead even though Italian authorities told the group to stand down and let the Libyan coast guard handle it, said Beppe Caccia, onshore co-ordinator for group. A previous rescue by a German humanitarian group led to a 17-day standoff with Italy before the captain forced her way into the port of Lampedusa. Salah Marghani, former Libyan justice minister and a human rights lawyer, said any European condemnation of the air strike is hypocrisy. Led by Italy, the EU has trained and funded the Libyan coast guard despite its record of abuses, and also relied upon militia-run detention centres to lock up migrants indefinitely, fuelling instability. The EU has said repeatedly, including after the air strike, that migrants should be evacuated to safe places, but has offered no specifics – or a haven for more than a handful from Libya. “This policy intentionally turned Libya into a firewall to refugees who escaped war and famine in Africa,” Marghani said. “This firewall gives the refugees two choices: either to drown while trying to escape Europe, or being arrested in the high sea to be sent back to Libya.” Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day’s most important headlines.

Ms. Kor was in Krakow, Poland, for an annual educational trip with the CANDLES Holocaust Museum and Education Center in Terre Haute, Ind., and died in the morning in her hotel room. While her health had recently improved, Ms. Kor had a tough year medically with a heart surgery and respiratory issues, according to her son Alex Kor, who was with her when she died. “My mom would be mad at me for crying,” he said in a phone interview from Poland. “She would also tell other people not to cry, to try and follow in her footsteps to try to make all wrongs right and make the world a better place. That’s her legacy. That’s her gift.” Eva Kor was a Jewish native of Romania who was sent in 1944 to the Auschwitz concentration camp, where most of her family was killed. She and her twin sister survived, but they were subjected to inhumane medical experiments. She later moved to Terre Haute, where she lived for more than three decades. She married a fellow Holocaust survivor, raised a family and worked in real estate. In 1985, she founded CANDLES, or Children of Auschwitz Nazi Deadly Lab Experiments Survivors. Ms. Kor’s sister, Miriam Zeiger, died in 1993 of cancer. Ms. Kor often gave lectures, wrote an autobiography and appeared in documentaries, sharing her story and message of forgiveness. During the annual trips to Poland, she would give tours of Auschwitz. “The themes of Eva’s life are apparent. We can overcome hardship and tragedy. Forgiveness can help us to heal,” a museum statement said. “And everyone has the power and responsibility to make this world a better place.” Museum officials said the Indiana centre will be closed until Tuesday in honour of Ms. Kor’s memory. In 2017, Ms. Kor was named as a recipient of the Sachem Award, which is Indiana’s highest honour. Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb said the “world lost a giant.” “Everywhere she went, Eva brought light into darkness and provided comfort to those in pain unlike anyone we’ve ever met,” he said in a statement. A public memorial service is planned. Museum officials said details would be released at a future date. Ms. Kor leaves her husband and two children.

"521"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-philippines-faces-call-for-un-investigation-into-war-on-drugs-2/"|"Stephanie Nebehay"|"More than two dozen countries formally called on Thursday for a United Nations investigation into thousands of killings in Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte’s war on drugs, activists said. Iceland submitted the draft resolution backed by mainly European states, they said. The text urges the government to prevent extrajudicial executions and marks the first time that the Human Rights Council is being asked to address the crisis. The Duterte government has insisted the more than 5,000 suspected drug dealers killed by police in anti-narcotics operations all put up a fight. But activists say that at least 27,000 have been killed since Duterte was elected in 2016 on a platform of crushing crime and that Myka, a three-year-old shot during a police raid last weekend, is among the latest victims. “Here we are three years later with 27,000 killed, among the most impoverished, in a massive crackdown. That is a conservative estimate,” Ellecer “Budit” Carlos of the Manila-based group iDefend told Reuters. “In a non-armed conflict context, this is the worst case of extrajudicial killings globally,” he said after urging the council to act. The Geneva forum is to vote on the resolution before ending its three-week session on July 12. The Philippines is among its current 47 members. Carlos conceded that Asian countries are unlikely to vote in favour of the text, adding: “I think it will be a close shave.” One Asian ambassador, speaking on condition of anonymity, indicated that his country would not support it, telling Reuters: “There are worse things happening in the world.” But activists say the Council and the office of U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet must shine a light on the situation. “For us a primary priority for this session is the situation in the Philippines,” said Laila Matar of Human Rights Watch. “Bodies continue to pile up in Manila and other urban areas, again in the context of the war on drugs which we have seen is very much a war against the poor, impoverished and marginalized communities, which are the biggest victims,” she said. It occurs in a wider context of “attacks on human rights defenders, media activists, journalists, anyone who really dares to speak up against the killings,” she added. “Police accounts of drug raids are not reliable – the officers enforcing the ‘drug war’ have been shown to plant weapons and drugs to justify the killings,” Matar told the Council this week.

"522"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-bank-of-england-governor-mark-carney-emerges-as-a-front-runner-to-take/"|"Paul Waldie"|"Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has emerged as a leading candidate to take over as head of the International Monetary Fund, one of the most important positions in the global economy. Mr. Carney is a contender to replace the current IMF managing director, Christine Lagarde, who has been nominated to become president of the European Central Bank. If confirmed by the European Parliament, as expected, Ms. Lagarde would take up the post on Oct. 31 when the current ECB president, Mario Draghi, steps down. Oddsmakers at Betway, an online betting company, and a number of IMF observers have pegged Mr. Carney as having among the best chances of winning the IMF job, given his background and experience. Based in Washington, the IMF’s main purpose is to ensure the stability of the global monetary system. It provides loans to countries in financial trouble, often under conditions that require the borrowing states to undergo significant fiscal and economic reforms. A total of 189 countries belong to the organization and contribute funds based on their relative size (votes on IMF matters are also weighted by contributions). The IMF was created in 1944 along with the World Bank, which works largely with developing countries. The head of the IMF has always been a European; four of the past six have been French. The World Bank president has always been an American. Although Mr. Carney is Canadian, he also holds British and Irish citizenship. That could make him European enough for the IMF’s 24-member executive board, which selects the new boss. He also has a wealth of international experience, having served more than six years as governor of the Bank of England, five years as governor of the Bank of Canada and seven years as chair of the Financial Stability Board, an international body that monitors the global financial system. He is slated to leave the Bank of England’s top job in January. Mr. Carney “has the CV, the experience and the connections to be seen as a safe pair of hands,” said James Knightley, the chief international economist at ING Group. Mr. Knightley added that there had been indications that Mr. Carney wanted to return to Canada and pursue a career in politics, “but I am not sure that would be as high up on his list now.” Mr. Carney was touted as a potential IMF chief in 2011, when the job went to Ms. Lagarde. In 2013, he landed at the Bank of England instead. Peter Dixon, the global financial economist for Commerzbank AG, said Mr. Carney’s experience at steering through the politics of Brexit would also be an added bonus for the IMF. But he’s no shoo-in. “Although he has British and Irish passports, he may face opposition from other continental European countries given his Canadian roots,” Mr. Dixon said. Mr. Carney hasn’t shied away from controversy during his tenure in Britain. He has faced criticism from Brexit-backers for issuing dire warnings about the economic consequences of leaving the European Union. During the 2016 Brexit referendum campaign, Mr. Carney warned that the country could fall into a technical recession if it left the European Union. In a report last year, the bank said that if Britain crashed out of the EU without a withdrawal agreement, the economy could shrink by as much as 8 per cent within five years and the unemployment rate would nearly double to 7.5 per cent. That has led to accusations he has politicized the bank. Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg labelled Mr. Carney “a second-tier Canadian politician” and added: “Having failed in Canadian politics, he’s got a job in the U.K., which he isn’t doing well.” Mr. Carney shot back by saying it was his job to point out challenges to the economy. There are also plenty of European candidates for the IMF job. They include the man who hired Mr. Carney for the Bank of England: George Osborne, Britain’s former chancellor of the Exchequer. Mr. Osborne resigned as chancellor in 2016 after the referendum, which saw 52 per cent of voters back leaving the EU. He had been a leading figure on the Remain campaign and he is now editor of London’s Evening Standard newspaper, as well as an adviser to the giant investment fund BlackRock. Betway’s top three candidates to win the job, based on odds posted on its website Thursday afternoon, are Mr. Osborne, Mr. Carney and economist Raghuram Rajan, former governor of the Reserve Bank of India. A $100 bet on Mr. Carney would pay out $650 if he gets the job. Mr. Osborne’s candidacy for the IMF job was met with derision in some quarters on Thursday, given his history as a belt-tightening finance minister. Mr. Osborne “was the worst U.K. chancellor in 300 years,” said economist David Blanchflower, who served on the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee. “He destroyed the nice steady growth he inherited in 2010. … Hard to see how that qualifies him to be boss of the IMF.” Another potential candidate is Mr. Draghi, although he is 71 years old and the IMF requires that incoming managers not be older than 65. The head of the Bank of France, François Villeroy de Galhau, could also be nominated, along with EU finance commissioner Pierre Moscovici and Kristalina Georgieva, the Bulgarian chief operating officer of the World Bank. The IMF’s executive directors will submit nominations for the post over the next few weeks, typically on behalf of member countries. The board will then draw up a shortlist of three candidates and interview each one. A final decision is usually done by consensus but the board can opt to pick the winner by a majority vote.

"523"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-strong-earthquake-strikes-southern-california-no-immediate-reports-of/"|"Bill Tarrant"|"A powerful earthquake jolted Southern California on Thursday, touching off fires and damaging buildings in a desert town northeast of Los Angeles, but authorities said there were only minor injuries. The 6.4 magnitude quake, the largest in two decades in the area, struck about 182 kilometres northeast of Los Angeles near the city of Ridgecrest at around 1:30 p.m. EDT, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The quake struck in an area on the edge of Death Valley National Park. The Kern County Fire Department said it was dealing with “multiple injuries,” two house fires, small brush fires and gas leaks. “However, we feel are going to have the upper hand on this,” Kern County Fire Chief David Witt said at a briefing. “We don’t know the exact number of injuries, but so far they have been minor.” Ridgecrest Mayor Peggy Breeden said she had declared a state of emergency, a step that enables the town to receive help from outside agencies. Ridgecrest Regional Hospital was being evacuated and admitted patients were being moved to other locations for fear of a powerful aftershock, she said. Although no injuries had been reported, Ms. Breeden said she has asked residents to check on their neighbours, particularly the elderly who make up a significant portion of the town’s population. “They’re all doing great. We’re a close-knit community and everybody is working to take care of each other,” she told Reuters by telephone. The quake is the largest in Southern California since the 1994 magnitude 6.6 Northridge earthquake, USGS geophysicist Paul Caruso said. That quake, which was centred in a heavily populated area of Los Angeles, killed 57 people and caused billions of dollars of damage. Ridgecrest may not get much respite in the hours and days ahead. USGS seismologist Lucy Jones said more than 80 aftershocks had hit the area in the hours since the initial quake. “We should be expecting lots of aftershocks and some of them will be bigger than the 3s we’ve been having so far,” Jones told a news conference. “I think the chance of having a magnitude 5 … is probably greater than 50-50,” she said. The USGS said the quake, initially reported as a magnitude 6.6, was very shallow – only 11 km – which would have amplified its effect. The temblor was felt throughout Los Angeles, as far north as Fresno, and as far east as Las Vegas, Nev. It was even felt south of the border in Mexico, where buildings were evacuated in the towns of Tijuana and Mexicali, according to Baja State officials. According to European quake agency EMSC, the quake was felt in an area inhabited by some 20 million people. Chuck Schlie, who was visiting Los Angeles for the first time with his family from St. Louis, said he was lying in bed at his hotel room in nearby Anaheim when he felt rumbling. “I thought, wow, this is really weird. Am I going crazy?” Mr. Schlie said outside the historic TCL Chinese Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard. “If you’ve never experienced it, you think, ‘Am I out of my mind? Why am I feeling like this?’” James Wilhorn, the manager of Howard’s Mini Mart in Ridgecrest, said his gas station was the only one open in the area because of damage to others and the Independence Day holiday, and there was a line of 20 cars waiting to fill their tanks. “I mopped up over 76 litres of wine that fell over in addition to the beer, soda and the cooler that fell over. We have several thousand dollars worth of damage,” Mr. Wilhorn said. The epicentre was very close to Ridgecrest, a town with a population of more than 27,600 in the high desert. The area has suffered earthquake swarms in the past, including a series of some 2,500 tremors over the course of five weeks in the summer of 1995. According to poweroutage.us, 5,851 customers were without power in Kern County. The Kern County Fire Department said the Ridgecrest Regional hospital was being evacuated in response to the quake. The hospital could not immediately be reached for comment. Temperatures in the area were expected to climb to nearly 38 C on Thursday, with extremely low humidity, the Weather Channel said. U.S. President Donald Trump said he had been briefed on the earthquake. “All seems to be very much under control!” Mr. Trump tweeted.

"524"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-new-orleans-amusement-park-abandoned-since-hurricane-katrina-may/"|"Rebecca Santana"|"The Zydeco Scream roller coaster stands motionless, and so does the Big Easy Ferris Wheel. Scampering rabbits, slithering snakes and lurking alligators are the only visitors to the abandoned Six Flags amusement park in New Orleans. Once, it resounded with children’s laughter and the shrieks of passengers on the thrill rides. Now the only sound is the drone of the cicadas. The amusement park on the city’s eastern edge is perhaps the most high-profile, lingering and ghostly reminder of Hurricane Katrina’s devastation. Ever since the levees failed and flooded the city with water in 2005, the park has stood empty, creating a nuisance for neighbours, a target for graffiti artists and an eerie landmark for sightseers. Now, the city’s mayor says she’s getting close to tearing it all down. “Right now, I have my sights on the Six Flags site, which we are now running numbers for demolition, really, as I speak,” Mayor LaToya Cantrell announced in May. She gave no further details on any demolition or redevelopment plans. In response to requests for information, her office released a statement saying an assessment is currently being done to determine the best use for the site, and that the administration is committed to improving the quality of life for residents of New Orleans East. The park opened in 2000 under the name Jazzland Theme Park, but it went bankrupt in two seasons. Six Flags took over the lease, but then Hurricane Katrina struck, submerging the park and much of the city. The theme park never reopened and eventually Six Flags went bankrupt. Control of the property went to the Industrial Development Board of the City of New Orleans. A cracked sign outside reads “Closed for storm,” and a security guard tries to keep people from sneaking inside. Some of the rides are still standing and visible from nearby roadways. A 2016 analysis commissioned by the board estimated it would cost about US$1.3-million to demolish the rides and other infrastructure, such as the Looney Tunes Adventure Area, in the abandoned 162-acre (65.6-hectare) park. And then there’s the question of what to do with the site afterward. Over the years, the city has tried to attract investors to the property but none of the plans have taken off. The assessment referenced by the mayor’s office was commissioned by the New Orleans Business Alliance for the city and released in June. It envisions turning the site into a destination for learning about climate change, resiliency and water issues, and for family-friendly activities such as excursions to the nearby Bayou Sauvage National Wildlife Refuge or zip line courses. The analysis also points out the looming threat of coastal land loss that the region faces from the encroaching waters of the Gulf. With Katrina’s 14th anniversary approaching, many residents are frustrated it has taken so long to address the park’s future. The neighbourhood has problems with snakes, alligators and wild hogs coming through, says Almarie Carter, who lives nearby. The security tries to keep people out, but she says kids still manage to find a way in. She’d like to see it torn down and have something for neighbourhood children built in its place. Instead, it’s a constant reminder of the city’s darkest hour. “When I exit off the interstate, it sickens me because it is not attractive at all,” she said. Another resident, Daren Hubbard, was frustrated with the repeated failed efforts to revitalize the area. Mr. Hubbard, who’s lived in the area since 1998, says he remembers when the park was built, and people would come in from nearby cities and neighbouring Mississippi to visit. “When this was up and running it was beautiful. The neighbourhood, everything around … was booming,” he said. Mr. Hubbard said he understands that the mayor can’t save everything: “But that’s been neglected too long.” Cyndi Nguyen represents the neighbourhood on City Council. She lives just a half a mile away and drives by the park daily. Her husband used to work there. “I remember hearing kids playing, laughing,” she said. “Parents having a great time with their children. The area was very vibrant.” Since the mayor spoke about demolishing the site, Ms. Nguyen’s constituents have been calling for more information. Ms. Nguyen thinks it’s premature to begin demolition in case some of the remaining infrastructure might be useful to future investors. She points out that the abandoned lot has had a bit of a second life as a movie set. But she’s encouraged by the mayor’s support for developing the area. In the meantime, the amusement park still attracts visitors who are curious – and saddened – to see what’s still standing after all these years. Brian Coppolino was part of a church group from northern Ohio on a mission to the New Orleans area to help rebuild houses. They stopped recently to see the site. “It’s almost overwhelming and just sad,” he said. “We’re seeing firsthand how long it takes to recover.” Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day’s most important headlines.

"525"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-kyriakos-mitsotakis-sworn-in-as-greeces-new-prime-minister-after/"|"Elena Becatoros Derek Gatopoulos Raf Casert"|"Greece’s bailout creditors on Monday bluntly rejected calls from the country’s new conservative government to ease draconian budget conditions agreed as part of its rescue program. Conservative party leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis was sworn in as Greece’s new prime minister Monday, a day after his resounding election victory on campaign pledges to cut taxes and negotiate new terms with international lenders. Euro area finance ministers meeting hours later in Brussels said key targets already agreed with Athens would not be changed. “Commitments are commitments, and if we break them, credibility is the first thing to fall apart. That brings about a lack of confidence and investment,” Mario Centeno, the Eurogroup president, told reporters after the meeting. Greece ended its third consecutive international bailout last summer – programs that rescued the country’s euro membership and staved off bankruptcy but also deepened poverty and unemployment as successive governments in Athens were forced to make spending cuts in return for the rescue loans. As part of those agreements, Greece has pledged to achieve government budget surpluses, before debt costs, of 3.5% of GDP for the coming years. That condition has shackled government spending and, critics say, stifled the country’s recovery. Klaus Regling, head of the euro area rescue fund and lead Greek bailout creditor, said the high surplus target would remain a key condition. “It’s very hard to see how debt sustainability can be achieved without it,” he said. “The 3.5% surplus is a cornerstone of the program. It was a cornerstone of the program from the beginning.” Mitsotakis, whose late father, Constantine Mitsotakis, was a conservative prime minister in the early 1990s, has promised to make Greece more business-friendly by lowering taxes and cutting red tape. But his new government faces pressing financial challenges, including a national debt that exceeds 180% of GDP and banks saddled 45% of their loans unpaid or in trouble. Analysts said Mitsotakis would be able to pursue growth-friendly policies despite the bailout constraints and financial challenges. “The main take-away is that New Democracy’s government will be the first one-party government in Greece after nearly ten years,” said Spyridoula Tzima, a senior financial analyst at Global Sovereign Ratings. “Mitsotakis (has) a strong mandate to implement his policy agenda.” In the election, Mitsotakis’ centre-right New Democracy party won 39.8% of the votes and 158 seats in the 300-member parliament, a comfortable majority. “The people gave us a strong mandate to change Greece, and we will honour that commandment in full,” Mitsotakis said after his swearing-in ceremony. “We will make the start today with hard work, with full confidence in our ability to respond to the circumstances.” Hundreds of conservative supporters braved the summer heat to greet him outside the prime minister’s official residence, chanting: “There his is! There he is! The Prime Minister!” He replaced Alexis Tsipras, whose left-wing Syriza party got 31.5% of the vote. Tsipras became the latest in a series of Greek political leaders to suffer election defeat after implementing tough policies prescribed by bailout creditors from the euro area and International Monetary Fund since 2010. The extreme right Golden Dawn party, the third largest in parliament at the height of the financial crisis, failed to make the 3% vote threshold needed to get seats in parliament. Mitsotakis’ new Cabinet will rely heavily on experienced politicians who served in previous conservative governments. The finance minister will be Christos Staikouras, an engineer and economist who previously served as deputy minister. Nikos Dendias, the new foreign minister, held previous Cabinet posts at the ministries of public order, development, and defence.

"526"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-jeffrey-epstein-expected-to-make-court-appearance-on-new-sex/"|"Brendan Pierson"|"American financier Jeffrey Epstein pleaded not guilty on Monday to charges of sex trafficking as prosecutors accused him of luring dozens of girls as young as 14 to his luxury homes in New York and Florida and paying them for sex acts. An indictment unsealed in federal court in Manhattan accused Epstein, 66, of arranging for girls to perform nude “massages” and other sex acts, and paying some girls to recruit others, from at least 2002 to 2005. “The alleged behaviour shocks the conscience, and while the charged conduct is from a number of years ago, it is still profoundly important to the many alleged victims, now young women,” U.S. attorney Geoffrey Berman said at a press conference. “They deserve their day in court.” Mr. Epstein was known for socializing with politicians and royalty, with friends who have included U.S. President Donald Trump, former president Bill Clinton, and according to court papers Britain’s Prince Andrew. None of those people were mentioned in the indictment. Wearing dark blue jail scrubs, Mr. Epstein entered his plea before U.S. magistrate Judge Henry Pitman to one count of sex trafficking and one count of sex trafficking conspiracy. Mr. Epstein faces up to 45 years in prison if convicted. According to the indictment, the former hedge fund manager “intentionally sought out minors and knew that many of his victims were in fact under the age of 18, including because, in some instances, minor victims expressly told him their age.” Mr. Epstein, who registered as a sex offender under a 2008 plea deal in Florida, has said in earlier court filings that his encounters with alleged victims were consensual and that he believed they were 18 when they occurred. Mr. Epstein will remain in jail until July 15, when his bail will be determined. Prosecutors told Judge Pitman that Mr. Epstein should be detained pending trial, saying he posed an “extraordinary risk of flight” because of his wealth, ownership of private planes and significant international ties. Mr. Epstein was arrested on Saturday night at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, where he had returned on his private plane from Paris. Prosecutors said a search of Mr. Epstein’s mansion in Manhattan, conducted under a search warrant, uncovered evidence of hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of nude photographs of “what appeared to be underage girls,” including some photos catalogued on compact discs and kept in a locked safe. Mr. Berman encouraged other victims to come forward and contact prosecutors. The case is being handled by the public corruption unit of Mr. Berman’s office. Mr. Berman declined to discuss media speculation about people affiliated or associated with Mr. Epstein, telling reporters: “I urge you not to read into that one way or the other.” Mr. Trump praised Mr. Epstein in an interview with New York magazine in 2002. “I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,” Mr. Trump said. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it – Jeffrey enjoys his social life.” Mr. Epstein first came under investigation in 2005 after police in Palm Beach, Fla., received reports he had sexually abused underage girls in his mansion there. By 2007, Mr. Epstein was facing a potential federal indictment for sexually abusing dozens of girls between 1999 and 2007, directing others to abuse them, and paying employees to bring victims to him, according to court filings. However, Mr. Epstein struck a deal to plead guilty in 2008 to a lesser Florida state felony-prostitution charge, and register as a sex offender. He served 13 months in a county jail, but was allowed to leave during the day to go to his office. Some of Mr. Epstein’s accusers have criticized that agreement as too lenient. Mr. Berman, the U.S. attorney, said he was not bound by it. Reid Weingarten, a lawyer for Mr. Epstein, told the magistrate judge that his client had led a “law-abiding life” since 2008, and that the indictment appeared to be “essentially a do-over.” Prosecutors who helped craft the Florida agreement included Alex Acosta, then the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida and now Mr. Trump’s Secretary of Labor. A spokeswoman for the Labor Department declined to comment on Sunday. According to the indictment, Mr. Epstein would initially recruit victims to provide “massages,” which they would perform nude or partially nude. Prosecutors said the encounters would become increasingly sexual in nature, sometimes including groping and indirect contact with victims’ genitals, where Mr. Epstein would typically masturbate and ask victims to touch him while he did. Mr. Epstein paid girls to recruit new girls, to ensure a “steady supply of new victims to exploit” prosecutors said. Three unnamed employees, one in Manhattan and two in Palm Beach, aided Mr. Epstein by arranging some of his sexual encounters, the indictment said. Several of Mr. Epstein’s accusers said that in the Florida deal, they were denied a chance to express their views, violating the federal Crime Victims’ Rights Act. In February, a federal judge in Florida called the deal illegal. Even so, the Department of Justice said in a June court filing that there was no reason to cancel it. At a second court hearing on Monday, assistant U.S. attorney Alex Rossmiller said some of Mr. Epstein’s victims have been informed of the new indictment. Mr. Rossmiller, asked by U.S. District Judge Richard Berman whether other people might be charged, said no further indictment was imminent but one was possible “down the road.” Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives confronted Mr. Acosta about his role in the Florida agreement in April, during a hearing on a routine budget matter. Mr. Acosta assured lawmakers that human trafficking was “an incredibly important issue,” and said his office’s efforts ensured that Mr. Epstein would be punished. “I understand the frustration,” Mr. Acosta said. “It’s important to understand that he was going to get off with no jail time or restitution. It was the work of our office that resulted in him going to jail.” The Justice Department is investigating whether government lawyers committed professional misconduct in the Florida case.

"527"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-conference-promoting-press-freedom-sets-ambitious-goals-but-receives/"|"Paul Waldie"|"Officials from more than 100 countries will gather in London this week for a two-day conference aimed at promoting press freedom around the world, but it’s not clear what the meeting will accomplish and it has already sparked controversy. Canada and the United Kingdom are co-hosting the Global Conference for Media Freedom, which opens Wednesday, and the organizers have set some ambitious objectives. They want each participating country to announce a national commitment to media freedom, spelling out how they plan to protect journalists and promote a free press. They also want all participants to sign a joint declaration on freedom of expression, pledging to work together on media freedom issues, and they hope to launch a global fund to provide legal services to journalists in jail or facing prosecution for their work. The conference will also host a special panel of legal experts that has been set up to “counter draconian laws that hinder journalists from going about their work.” The panel is headed by human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, who has been appointed Britain’s Special Envoy on Media Freedom. “A free press is the cornerstone of democratic societies and essential for the protection and promotion of human rights,” Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said in a statement Monday. “I look forward to two days of in-depth conversations on the current state of media freedom and on the practical steps we can take to bring about positive change in our own countries and around the world.” British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt added: “My aim for this conference is to work with my counterparts to agree on a way to protect media freedom and impose a cost on those who abuse it." Attacks against journalists have been rising in recent years, and there has been growing concern about the number of governments taking steps to control the media under the guise of preventing “fake news.” A total of 99 journalists were killed in 2018, the deadliest year on record, while another 348 were detained and 60 taken hostage by non-state groups. Last October’s assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi Arabian government officials caused a global outcry. Turkey has come under criticism for locking up more journalists than any other country. Last year 68 journalists were imprisoned in Turkey, according to a report by the Committee to Protect Journalists. The report also noted that 28 journalists were imprisoned around the world in 2018 on charges of promoting false news, up from just two nine years ago. Conference organizers said they hope the meeting will put pressure on countries such as Saudi Arabia and Turkey. “We will be up front about those issues,” said one conference official who was not authorized to speak to the media. They also hope to highlight a host of other issues through more than 20 panel discussions, with topics ranging from examining the financial pressures facing media organizations to promoting the safety of female journalists, reviewing religion in the media and highlighting the state of media freedom in the Americas, Western Balkans and Africa. There will also be a focus on the power of social media to spread false information. Last week the British government announced an £18-million program to counter the rise of disinformation across Eastern Europe. But the conference is not without controversy. It’s still not clear who will be attending the meeting, and participants are not obligated to announce national commitments. The organizers have asked countries to send government ministers, but they still don’t know exactly how many will turn up. Many countries are expected to send low-level officials. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has declined an invitation and is sending a deputy instead. There are also few details about the global fund for legal services, including how it will be administered and where the money will come from. The organizers are hoping Canada and the U.K. will kick-start contributions. Canada is also slated to hold a follow-up conference next year to assess the progress countries have made in promoting media freedom. Russia’s ambassador to the U.K. has also complained that two Russian media outlets, the RT television channel and Sputnik news agency, have been denied credentials to cover the conference. The exclusion “amounts to direct, politically motivated discrimination,” the embassy said in a statement. Conference organizers said they rejected requests from outlets they considered to be engaged in propaganda, not news gathering. However, they said other representatives from the Russian government and media would be attending.

"528"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-iran-passes-uranium-enrichment-cap-set-in-2015-nuclear-deal-official/"|"Babak Dehghanpisheh Tuqa Khalid"|"Iran threatened on Monday to restart deactivated centrifuges and ramp up enrichment of uranium to 20-per-cent purity in a move away from the 2015 nuclear deal, but the head of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard insisted the world knows Tehran is not pursuing nuclear arms. The threats to increase enrichment, made by Tehran’s nuclear agency spokesman, would go far beyond the small steps Iran has taken in the past week to nudge stocks of fissile material just beyond limits in the pact that Washington abandoned last year. They would reverse the major achievements of the agreement, intended to block Iran from making a nuclear weapon, and raise serious questions about whether the accord is still viable. Iran omitted important details about how far it might go to returning to the status quo before the pact, when Western experts believed it could build a bomb within months. But Major-General Hossein Salami, the head of the Revolutionary Guard, denied Iran was pursuing a nuclear weapon. “Why do they globally sanction us about the nuclear issue when the world knows that we are not pursuing a weapon? In reality they are sanctioning us because of knowledge,” Maj.-Gen. Salami was quoted as saying by the semi-official Tasnim news agency. “Nuclear weapons have no place in Islam. Islam never approves of weapons of mass destruction,” he added. Despite the Iranian threat to boost enrichment, the United States said its renewed sanctions against Tehran were working and warned Iranian leaders not to underestimate U.S. resolve. “President Trump’s maximum pressure campaign against Iran is working,” White House national security adviser John Bolton told a pro-Israel group in Washington. “We’re just getting started. ... The president’s goal is to get a new deal that would be negotiated in the best interests of the United States.” U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, who spoke to the same group, added a warning: “Iran should not confuse American restraint with a lack of American resolve,” reiterating Washington’s resolve to protect U.S. personnel and citizens in the Middle East. Nuclear diplomacy is one aspect of a wider confrontation between Washington and Tehran that has threatened to spiral into open conflict since the United States tightened sanctions from May. Behrouz Kamalvandi, spokesman for Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization (IAEA), confirmed that Tehran had enriched uranium beyond the 2015 deal’s limit of 3.67 per-cent purity, passing 4.5 per cent, according to news agency ISNA. The IAEA – the United Nations nuclear watchdog – confirmed it had verified Iran’s enrichment was beyond 3.67 per cent. Iran has said it will take another, third step away from the deal within 60 days. Mr. Kamalvandi said options included enriching uranium to 20-per-cent purity or beyond, and restarting IR-2 M centrifuges dismantled under the deal. Such threats put new pressure on European countries, which insist Iran must continue to comply with the agreement even though the United States is no longer doing so. French President Emmanuel Macron was sending his top diplomatic adviser to Iran on Tuesday and Wednesday to try to help defuse tensions, a presidential official said. The White House said Mr. Trump had spoken to Mr. Macron on Monday to discuss efforts to ensure Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon. The sanctions imposed by Washington threaten to eliminate the benefits Iran was meant to receive for agreeing to curbs on its nuclear program with world powers. The confrontation has brought the United States and Iran close to the brink of conflict, with Mr. Trump calling off air strikes last month minutes before impact. Enriching uranium up to 20-per-cent purity would be a dramatic move, since that was the level Iran achieved before the deal, although back then it had a far larger stockpile than it is likely to be able to rebuild in the short term. It is considered an important intermediate stage on the path to obtaining the 90 per cent pure-fissile uranium needed for a bomb. One of the main achievements of the deal was Iran’s agreement to dismantle its advanced IR-2M centrifuges, used to purify uranium. Iran had 1,000 of them installed at its large Natanz enrichment site before the deal. Under the deal, it is allowed to operate only up to two for testing. Still, the threatened measures also appear intended to be sufficiently ambiguous to hold back from fully repudiating the deal. Mr. Kamalvandi did not specify how much uranium Iran might purify to the higher level, nor how many centrifuges it would consider restarting. He did not mention other more advanced centrifuges, including the most advanced, the IR-8. Iran has said all the steps it is contemplating are reversible. European countries do not directly support the U.S. sanctions, but have been unable to come up with ways to allow Iran to avert them. In a separate stand off, Iran’s foreign minister accused Britain of “piracy” for seizing an Iranian oil tanker last week. Britain says the ship, which was boarded by Royal Marines as it was entering the Mediterranean off Gibraltar, was bound for Syria in violation of European Union sanctions over the conflict there. “Iran is neither a member of the EU nor subject to any European oil embargo. Last I checked, EU was against extraterritoriality. UK’s unlawful seizure of a tanker with Iranian oil on behalf of #B_Team is piracy, pure and simple,” Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted on Monday, using ‘B team’ as a derisory term for the Trump administration. Iran says the deal allows it to respond to the U.S. breach by reducing its compliance, and it will do so every 60 days. Mr. Zarif also tweeted that world powers will not be able to negotiate a better deal than the 2015 nuclear deal. “#B_Team sold @realDonaldTrump on the folly that killing #JCPOA thru #EconomicTerrorism can get him a better deal,” Mr. Zarif wrote, referring to the deal by its acronym for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. “As it becomes increasingly clear that there won’t be a better deal, they’re bizarrely urging Iran’s full compliance. There’s a way out, but not with #B_Team in charge.” Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day’s most important headlines.

"529"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-theresa-may-stands-by-beleaguered-us-ambassador-after-trump-comments/"|"Danica Kirka"|"U.S. President Donald Trump lashed out at Britain’s ambassador to the United States for a second day, describing him as “wacky” and a “pompous fool” after leaked documents revealed the envoy’s dim view of Trump’s administration. Trump fired off a series of tweets about Ambassador Kim Darroch hours after British Prime Minister Theresa May gave the veteran diplomat her continued support. “The wacky Ambassador that the U.K. foisted upon the United States is not someone we are thrilled with, a very stupid guy,” Trump wrote in one tweet. Darroch’s forthright, unfiltered views on the U.S. administration – meant for a limited audience and discreet review – appeared in leaked diplomatic documents that were published in Britain’s Mail on Sunday newspaper. The disclosures have caused embarrassment and an awkward situation for two countries that often celebrate having a “special relationship.” In his Twitter comments Tuesday, Trump combined criticism of Darroch with a broadside at May, chiding the British leader for failing to get her Brexit deal with the European Union through Parliament. “I told theresa – may how to do that deal, but she went her own foolish way-was unable to get it done. A disaster!” Trump tweeted. “I don’t know the Ambassador but have been told he is a pompous fool.” Darroch has served as Britain’s envoy in Washington since 2016. In one of his leaked memos, he said that to communicate effectively with Trump, “you need to make your points simple, even blunt.” The published documents also included the ambassador calling the Trump administration’s policies on Iran “incoherent,” saying the U.S. president might be indebted to “dodgy Russians,” and raising doubts about whether the Trump White House “will ever look competent.” Darroch has had a close relationship with numerous Trump administration officials. The president’s advisers have been frequent guests at British Embassy events. An investigation is under way to find who was responsible for leaking the memos, a major breach of diplomatic security. May’s spokesman said Tuesday that the prime minister phoned Darroch to tell him he still had her full support. But the tweets by Trump, which followed a similar social media barrage on Monday, ratcheted up pressure on Britain’s government. Darroch also has been accused by some Brexit-backing U.K. politicians of lacking enthusiasm for Britain’s departure from the European Union. The journalist who reported the leak, Isabel Oakeshott, is a strong Brexit backer and an ally of Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, who also is Britain’s leading champion of Trump. Trump once said Farage would “do a great job” as ambassador to the United States. Farage sidestepped the idea Monday, saying “I’m not a diplomat.” The tiff with Trump also put pressure on Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, the two men vying to succeed May as Conservative leader and prime minister. Both say they will lead the U.K. out of the European Union and secure new trade deals around the world – notably with the United States. Hunt, who is Britain’s current foreign secretary, reprimanded Trump on Tuesday, writing in his own tweets that the president’s comments about Darroch were “disrespectful and wrong.” During a televised debate Tuesday night, Hunt said “if I am our next prime minister, the ambassador in Washington stays, because it is our decision.” Johnson declined during the debate to make a similar commitment to keep Darroch in his post, though he said whoever leaked the diplomatic cables should be “eviscerated.” “I think it’s very important we should have a close partnership, a close friendship with the United States,” he said. While British officials hunted for the culprit behind the leak, senior Conservative Party figure and former Foreign Secretary William Hague said the government was right to back Darroch. “You can’t change an ambassador at the demand of a host country,” Hague told the BBC. “It is their job to give an honest assessment of what is happening in that country.” Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day’s most important headlines.

While I want nothing more than to bring my show to fans in Saudi Arabia, after better educating myself on the issues, I believe it is important for me to make clear my support for the rights of women, the LGBTQ community and freedom of expression,” Minaj said in a statement Tuesday to The Associated Press. Minaj was originally scheduled to headline the concert on July 18. In Saudi Arabia, gender segregation between single men and women is still enforced in many restaurants, coffee shops, public schools and universities, but other rules have loosened with women now allowed to drive and attend events in sports stadiums. Jeddah World Fest, which in line with Saudi laws is alcohol and drug-free, is open to people 16 and older and will take place at the King Abdullah Sports Stadium in the Red Sea city. Other performers include former One Direction member Liam Payne and DJ-producer Steve Aoki. The Human Rights Foundation issued a statement last week, calling for Minaj and other performers to pull out of the show. On Tuesday, the New York-based organization praised Minaj’s decision to not perform at the concert. “This is what leadership looks like. We are grateful to Nicki Minaj for her inspiring and thoughtful decision to reject the Saudi regime’s transparent attempt at using her for a public relations stunt,” said Thor Halvorssen, president of the Human Rights Foundation. “The July 18 festival in Saudi Arabia still shows Liam Payne as a performer. We hope that he follows Nicki Minaj’s lead. Minaj’s moral stance differs from celebrity performers like J-Lo and Mariah Carey who in the past have chosen to line their pockets with millions of dollars and stand with dictatorial governments as opposed to with oppressed communities and imprisoned human rights activists.” Over the past several months, the kingdom has seen performances by Carey, Enrique Iglesias, the Black Eyed Peas, Sean Paul, David Guetta and Tiesto. That’s a stark change from when Saudi morality police would raid establishments that played loud music. Saudi organizers said the Jeddah World Fest will be broadcast globally. The kingdom is also promising quick electronic visas for international visitors who want to attend. Saudi Arabia saw profound change last year as a result of Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s top-down reform efforts, including the opening of the first movie theatre and the lifting of the world’s only ban on women driving. In December 2018, women – some without head scarves – drove themselves to a Formula-E car race where thousands of young Saudis and hundreds of international visitors partied into the night at concerts. The spectacle would have been unthinkable until recently in the ultra-conservative kingdom where religious police used to enforce strict gender segregation and scolded women for not covering their hair. But there’s a hard limit to the reforms – as revealed by the brutal killing of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents close to the crown prince in October and the reported torture of several women’s rights activists in detention. While the arena for entertainment is widening, the space for political engagement and dissent has virtually disappeared. The 33-year-old crown prince, backed by his father King Salman, presides over a nation where he alone defines the pace and scope of change.

"531"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-britains-labour-party-shifts-policy-now-backs-new-brexit-referendum/"|"Jill Lawless"|"Britain’s main opposition Labour Party said Tuesday that the country’s soon-to-be chosen new leader should hold a second referendum on whether to leave the European Union or remain in the bloc, as the two contenders for the job prepared to face a grilling in a TV debate over their plans to break Britain’s Brexit gridlock. In a significant shift, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the party would campaign to stay in the EU if a referendum were called by whoever succeeds Prime Minister Theresa May. She announced her resignation last month after failing to get Parliament to back her divorce deal with the EU. Lawmakers Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt are competing to replace May as Conservative Party leader and prime minister. The winner of the contest is due to take office later this month and will have barely more than three months to win support for a Brexit deal before Britain’s scheduled Oct. 31 departure date. In a letter to party members, Corbyn said that the new prime minister “should have the confidence to put their deal, or no-deal, back to the people in a public vote.” “In those circumstances, I want to make it clear that Labour would campaign for Remain against either no-deal or a Tory deal that does not protect the economy and jobs,” he said. Labour’s opponents – and many supporters – have accused the party of dithering over Brexit for fear of alienating voters on either side of the national divide over Europe. Corbyn, a long-time critic of the EU, has resisted calls for a second referendum, saying Labour must respect voters’ 2016 decision to leave. The left-of-centre party has previously rejected May’s deal but also ruled out leaving the EU without an agreement and called for an election that the party hopes will bring a Labour government to power. But the party’s poor showing in recent local and European elections suggests Labour is losing support to parties including the Liberal Democrats and the Greens that advocate remaining in the EU. Corbyn’s letter clarifies the party’s position – up to a point. It’s still unclear what Labour would do about Brexit if it formed a government. Labour lawmaker Hilary Benn, who heads Parliament’s Brexit Committee, said “this is a very significant moment.” “We saw what a lack of clarity did to Labour in the European elections. We got 14% of the vote,” he said. But John Mann, a Labour legislator who backs Brexit, said the shift would cost the party support in areas of the country that voted strongly to leave the EU. “There’s no indication whatsoever that voters in my area ... have changed their mind,” he said. “I’ve asked repeatedly of Jeremy Corbyn, what will be Labour’s policy at a general election? I haven’t been clear and I’m not clear now.” Tory contenders Hunt and Johnson were due to square off later Tuesday in their only head-to-head debate in the campaign. Both vow to succeed where May failed and take Britain out of the EU – even if that means leaving without an agreement on divorce terms and future relations. Most businesses and economists think a no-deal Brexit would plunge Britain into recession as customs checks take effect at U.K. ports and tariffs are imposed on trade between the U.K. and the EU. But many Conservatives think embracing a no-deal Brexit may be the only way to win back voters from the upstart Brexit Party led by Nigel Farage. Growing concern about the chance of a no-deal Brexit and signs that the British economy could be heading toward recession have weakened the pound, which fell Tuesday to $1.2440, near a two-year low. Bookies and pollsters make Johnson, a populist former mayor of London, the strong favourite over the stolid Hunt. Hunt has expressed frustration at the reluctance of Johnson to take part in debates. He hopes Tuesday’s showdown offers a chance to turn the contest around, though it may be too late. Ballot papers have already gone out to the party’s estimated 160,000 voting members, many of whom have already made their choice. The two candidates are also likely to face questions about a fierce row over leaked cables from Britain’s ambassador in Washington offering unflattering assessments of President Donald Trump’s administration. In the memos, Ambassador Kim Darroch called Trump’s White House dysfunctional, inept and chaotic. The president let rip with tweets branding Darroch “very stupid” and “a pompous fool,” and saying the administration would no longer deal with him. Trump also renewed criticism of May’s handing of Brexit. In contrast, he has spoken warmly of both Johnson and Hunt. Hunt, who is Britain’s foreign secretary, reprimanded Trump, tweeting that his comments were “disrespectful and wrong to our Prime Minister and my country.” Hunt wrote that “allies need to treat each other with respect,” and said that “if I become PM our Ambassador stays.” His tone contrasted with that of Johnson, his predecessor as foreign secretary. Asked about Trump’s criticism of May, Johnson said, “Myself, I have said some pretty critical things about the Brexit negotiations so far.” “I think it’s very important that we have a strong relationship with our most important ally,” he said.

"532"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-us-looks-to-build-military-coalition-to-protect-key-shipping-lanes/"|"Phil Stewart"|"The United States hopes to enlist allies over the next two weeks or so in a military coalition to safeguard strategic waters off Iran and Yemen, where Washington blames Iran and Iran-aligned fighters for attacks, the top U.S. general said on Tuesday. Under the plan, which has only been finalized in recent days, the United States would provide command ships and lead surveillance efforts for the military coalition. Allies would patrol waters near those U.S. command ships and escort commercial vessels with their nation’s flags. Marine General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, articulated those details to reporters following meetings on Tuesday about it with acting U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. “We’re engaging now with a number of countries to see if we can put together a coalition that would ensure freedom of navigation both in the Straits of Hormuz and the Bab al-Mandab,” Dunford said. “And so I think probably over the next couple of weeks we’ll identify which nations have the political will to support that initiative and then we’ll work directly with the militaries to identify the specific capabilities that’ll support that.” Iran has long threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, through which almost a fifth of the world’s oil passes, if it was unable to export its oil, something U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has sought as a way to pressure Tehran to renegotiate a deal on its nuclear program. But the U.S proposal for an international coalition to safeguard shipping in the Strait, at the mouth of the Gulf, has been gaining momentum since attacks in May and June against oil tankers in Gulf waters. Last month, Iran shot down a U.S. drone near the Strait, prompting President Donald Trump to order retaliatory air strikes, only to call them off. The deputy chief cabinet secretary of Japan, one of Washington’s key global allies, declined to comment directly when asked about Dunford’s comments. “We are quite concerned about mounting tensions in the Mideast, and guaranteeing safe passage in the Hormuz Strait is vital to our nation’s energy security, as well as to the peace and prosperity of international society,” Kotaro Nogami told a regular news conference in Tokyo on Wednesday. “Japan will stay in close contact with the United States and other related nations and continue to make efforts for stability and the reduction of tension in the Mideast.” Although U.S. officials had publicly discussed plans to safeguard the Strait, Dunford’s disclosure that the coalition would also seek to bolster security in the Bab al-Mandab off Yemen appeared to be a new element. The United States, as well as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, have long fretted over attacks by Iran-aligned Houthi fighters in the narrow Bab al-Mandab waterway, which connects the Red Sea with the Gulf of Aden and the Arabian Sea. Nearly 4 million barrels of oil are shipped daily through the Bab al-Mandab to Europe, the United states and Asia plus commercial goods. Dunford said the United States would provide “command and control” ships but said the goal would be for other countries to provide vessels to patrol waters between those command ships. The third part of the mission would involve coalition members escorting their countries’ commercial vessels. “The expectation is that the actual patrolling and escorts would be done by others,” he said. Dunford said the size of the campaign could be adjusted based on the number of countries that commit to it. “This will be scalable, right? So with a small number of contributors, we can have a small mission. And we’ll expand that as the number of nations that are willing to participate identify themselves,” he said.

"533"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-iran-warns-britain-of-repercussions-over-supertanker-seizure/"|"Nasser Karimi"|"Iran’s president said Wednesday that Britain will face “repercussions” over the seizure of an Iranian supertanker last week that authorities in Gibraltar suspect was breaching European sanctions on oil shipments to Syria. Hassan Rouhani was quoted by the official IRNA news agency as calling the seizure “mean and wrong” during a Cabinet meeting. “You are an initiator of insecurity and you will understand its repercussions,” he warned the British government, calling for the “full security” of international shipping lanes. The tanker’s detention comes at a particularly sensitive time as tensions between the U.S. and Iran grow over the unravelling of the 2015 nuclear deal, from which President Donald Trump withdrew last year. In recent weeks, Iran has begun to openly breach limits on uranium enrichment set by the deal in order to pressure European signatories to salvage it. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, meanwhile, denied the supertanker belonged to Iran, saying whoever owned the oil shipment and the vessel could pursue the case through legal avenues. Iran had earlier summoned the British ambassador over what it called the “illegal interception” of the ship. The latest U.S.-Iranian tensions date back to last year, when Trump withdrew from the nuclear accord and restored heavy sanctions on Iran, including its oil industry, exacerbating an economic crisis that has sent the currency plummeting. A senior Iranian security official said Wednesday that Iran will not reverse its decision to increase uranium enrichment beyond the limits set by the accord until it achieves its “full rights” under the deal. Ali Shamkhani told a French envoy that the decision to increase enrichment is an “unchangeable strategy” and criticized European countries for their “lack of will” in providing relief from U.S. sanctions, according to the official IRNA news agency. But the United States on Wednesday urged the signatories to the nuclear deal not to give in to Iran’s demands by providing new economic incentives to get it to pull back from its recent escalation of its atomic program. Jackie Wolcott, the U.S. ambassador to international organizations in Vienna, told a gathering of the International Atomic Energy Agency that Iran’s recent moves to enrich uranium beyond the deal’s limits amounted to “nuclear extortion.” She said Iran’s “misbehaviour” should “not be rewarded.” France and other countries have called on Iran to go back to complying with the nuclear deal. Emmanuel Bonne, a French presidential envoy, is in Iran this week for talks aimed at resolving the crisis. In the deal with world powers negotiated by the Obama administration, Iran had agreed to curb its nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief. It has offered to return to the agreement, but Trump has long rejected the deal, saying it was too generous to Tehran and did not address its involvement in regional conflicts. In May, the United States dispatched a carrier group, bombers and fighter jets to the Persian Gulf region in response to alleged Iranian threats. The U.S. has accused Iran of involvement in the bombing of oil tankers in the Gulf and says it shot down an American drone in international airspace. Iran denies any involvement in the attacks on the tankers and says the drone had veered into its airspace. Iran is a key ally of Syrian President Bashar Assad’s government, which is under Western sanctions linked to attacks on civilians during the country’s civil war.

The group, known by its French acronym RSF, had not publicized its April visit, which it called unprecedented, in hopes that the authorities would pardon the detainees during the holy Muslim month of Ramadan, which ended weeks ago, it said at the start of a media freedom conference in London. Secretary-General Christophe Deloire led the delegation, which met Saudi officials including the ministers of justice and media, the minister of state for foreign affairs, the public prosecutor and the head of the state-backed human rights commission. The Saudi government communications office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the visit and the status of the detainees. The kingdom has come under heightened international criticism over its human rights record after Khashoggi was murdered and dismembered by Saudi operatives inside its Istanbul consulate last October. The CIA and some Western countries believe the killing was ordered by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, which Saudi officials deny. A UN expert last month said he and other senior officials should be investigated given credible evidence against them. The detention and trial of around a dozen women activists, including journalist Hatoon al-Fassi and bloggers Eman al-Nafjan and Nouf Abdulaziz, on charges that include contacts with foreign journalists has also sparked Western outrage. “A signal of strong political will from the Saudi government is now needed for this damage to begin to be repaired, and we believe that can only be accomplished by serious measures such as the release of all jailed journalists in the country,” said Deloire. He added that engaging directly with the Saudi authorities was a “necessary step” which succeeded in opening a channel. The detained journalists include prominent blogger Raif Badawi, who is serving a 10-year sentence for expressing controversial opinions online, and Saleh al-Shehi, a columnist for Arabic-language daily al-Watan who was arrested last year after accusing the royal court of corruption. Saudi Arabia dipped into the bottom 10 countries in RSF’s 2019 World Press Freedom Index, and is now ranked 172 out of 180 countries. RSF said releasing the journalists was necessary for Riyadh to maintain its chairmanship of the G20 summit, which it is set to hold next year.

"535"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-former-british-pm-john-major-vows-legal-action-if-new-conservative/"|"Danica Kirka Jill Lawless"|"A former British prime minister threatened Wednesday to take Conservative Party leadership candidate Boris Johnson to court if he tries to suspend Parliament to deliver a U.K. departure from the European Union without a deal. John Major told the BBC it would be unacceptable and against tradition to shut down Parliament, and he would seek a court ruling to overturn it if it happened. Major’s suggestion is important because Parliament has repeatedly signalled its opposition to a no-deal Brexit, but has no obvious way of stopping it. A legal challenge offers a potential new route. “You cannot and should not bypass Parliament in this fashion,” Major said. “I cannot imagine how anyone could conceivably think that is right.” Major’s comments follow a televised debate between Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, the two men seeking to replace Theresa May as Conservative leader and prime minister. Johnson, who has said leaving the EU by the scheduled date of Oct. 31 is a “do or die” matter, refused to rule out bypassing Parliament to prevent lawmakers from blocking a no-deal departure. “I’m not going to take anything off the table, any more than I’m going to take no-deal off the table,” Johnson said. “I think it’s absolutely bizarre at this stage in the negotiations for the U.K. – yet again – to be weakening its own position.” Hunt flatly rejected the idea and suggested it was dangerous. “When that has happened in the past, when Parliament has been shut down against its will, we actually had a civil war,” Hunt said, referring to the 17th-century showdown between royalists and Parliament over how the country would be governed. Parliament won. King Charles I was tried and executed. A move to send lawmakers home early – known as proroguing Parliament – would require the formal approval of Queen Elizabeth II. Major said such a request would drag the usually neutral monarch into a constitutional controversy. “There is no conceivable justification, wherever we are, in closing down Parliament to bypass its sovereignty,” Major said. “I seem to recall that the Brexiteers, led by Mr. Johnson, actually campaigned in the referendum for the sovereignty of Parliament … They can’t be concerned for the sovereignty of Parliament except when it is inconvenient to Mr. Johnson.” Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day’s most important headlines.

"536"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-bond-between-uk-us-in-turmoil-following-resignation-of-british/"|"Paul Waldie"|"Britain and the United States are locked in a growing diplomatic spat that has forced out the British ambassador to Washington and prompted sharp criticism of the man poised to become the country’s next Prime Minister. The row has been described as the worst dispute between the transatlantic allies in more than 100 years and it highlights the complexities countries face in dealing with the volatile temper of U.S. President Donald Trump. It has also raised difficult questions for Britain as it looks to sign trade deals with the U.S. and other nations after Brexit. The saga escalated on Wednesday when Britain’s ambassador to the U.S., Sir Kim Darroch, resigned a day after being denounced by Mr. Trump as “wacky,” “very stupid” and a “pompous fool.” The insults had been in response to the publication last Sunday of a collection of confidential e-mails Sir Kim had sent to government officials in London in which he described the Trump White House as “clumsy and inept.” Mr. Trump not only lashed out at Sir Kim, he also said that the White House would no longer deal with the diplomat, effectively cutting off his Washington contacts. “The current situation is making it impossible for me to carry out my role as I would like,” Sir Kim said in his resignation letter. His resignation has set off a flurry of finger pointing and accusations in London. Prime Minister Theresa May quickly ordered a police investigation into the leak but also stood by Sir Kim, insisting that he had simply offered the kind of frank assessment that is expected from diplomats. She also said that Britain would not bow to pressure from Mr. Trump and fire the ambassador. “Good government depends on public servants being able to give full and frank advice,” she told the House of Commons on Wednesday and added that she deeply regretted his decision to step down. Sir Simon McDonald, the top civil servant in the British Foreign Office, called the leak “the worst breach of trust in our service in my career” and added that Britain hadn’t faced this kind of problem with an ambassador to the U.S. since 1856, “when the incumbent was accused of recruiting Americans to fight on the British side in the Crimean War.” There were also indications that Sir Kim decided to resign after he failed to win the backing of former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who is leading the race to replace Ms. May as leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister. Conservative Party members are about to vote for the next leader who will take over from Ms. May on July 24. In a television debate on Tuesday with his only opponent, current Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, Mr. Johnson refused to say if he would retain Sir Kim in his post. Mr. Johnson has a close relationship with Mr. Trump and the U.S. President has spoken highly of him. “I alone will decide who takes important and politically sensitive jobs,” Mr. Johnson said during the debate. On Wednesday, he expressed regret at Sir Kim’s resignation and added that he hoped whoever leaked the e-mails “is run down, caught and eviscerated.” Mr. Hunt tried to differentiate himself from Mr. Johnson and offered his full support for Sir Kim.“I think it is absolutely essential that when our diplomats do their jobs all over the world … we defend them,” he told reporters during the Global Conference on Media Freedom, which is taking place in London. Sir Kim was “just doing what he should have been doing giving a frank assessment, a personal assessment, of the political situation in the country where he was posted. That’s why I defended him and I think we all should,” he added. Others were less restrained. Tory MP Alan Duncan, who is Minister of State for Europe and the Americas and backs Mr. Hunt’s leadership bid, called Mr. Johnson’s response “contemptible.” “Boris Johnson has basically thrown our ambassador under a bus,” Mr. Duncan said Wednesday. But others came to Mr. Johnson’s defence and said the criticism was unfair. “The person responsible is the person who leaked this,” said Michael Fallon, a Tory MP who backs Mr. Johnson. The motive for the leak has also become hotly debated, with suggestions that hard-line supporters of Brexit were eager to see Sir Kim leave Washington because of his previous post as Britain’s ambassador to the European Union, where he was perceived as a proponent of Britain remaining in the EU. The leaked e-mails were obtained by Isabel Oakeshott, a Brexit sympathizer who has ties to Nigel Farage, the leader of the Brexit Party. Ms. Oakeshott has dismissed theories that she was given the material to force out Sir Kim. “This is ludicrous,” she said on Twitter. “Like I’ve said, sometimes a great story is just that; not some kind of global conspiracy.” Mr. Trump has yet to comment on Sir Kim’s resignation. But a spokesperson for the State Department said that "the United States and the United Kingdom share a bond that is bigger than any individual, and we look forward to continuing that partnership.” "|"‘Bond’ between U.K., U.S. in turmoil following resignation of British ambassador to Washington"|"2019-07-10T16:29:13-0400"|"Britain,U.S,United States,diplomatic dispute,brexit,trade relations,U.K.,United Kingdom,British ambassador to Washington resignation,Sir Kim Darroch,Boris Johnson,britain,sir,kim,ambassador",

Television footage showed strong winds sweeping through a restaurant in the Halkidiki peninsula, a region popular with tourists in the summer. Streets in towns in the area were dotted with uprooted pine trees and overturned motorcycles, photographs posted on websites showed. “It is the first time in my 25-year career that I have lived through something like this,” Athansios Kaltsas, director of the Nea Moudania Medical Centre, where many of the injured were treated for fractures, told Greek television. “It was so abrupt, and so sudden,” he said. Kaltsas said patients taken to the clinic ranged in age from 8 months to over 70. Some suffered head injuries from trees and other falling objects. Two elderly Czech tourists were killed when strong winds and water swept away their travel trailer, police said. Elsewhere in the region, a woman and an 8-year-old boy, both Romanian nationals, were killed after a roof collapsed on a restaurant in Nea Plagia. A man and a young boy, both Russians, died after a tree collapsed near their hotel in the seaside town of Potidea, authorities said. Such severe weather is unusual in Greece, where summers are typically hot and dry. Meteorologist Klearxos Marousakis described conditions as “extremely unusual” for this time of year. Meteorologists forecast it would continue to rain in the area until about 9 a.m. on Thursday. Authorities declared Halkidiki in a state of emergency, and Greece’s newly appointed citizens’ protection minister was due to visit early on Thursday. At least 140 firefighters were operating in the area.

"538"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-divisive-telescope-to-restart-building-next-week-in-hawaii-2/"|"Jennifer Sinco Kelleher And Caleb Jones"|"Construction on a giant telescope will start again next week after lengthy court battles and passionate protests from those who say building it on Hawaii’s tallest mountain will desecrate land sacred to some Native Hawaiians. State officials announced Wednesday that the road to the top of Mauna Kea mountain on the Big Island will be closed starting Monday as equipment is delivered. Scientists revere the mountain for its summit above the clouds that provides a clear view of the sky with very little air and light pollution. Astronomers say it will allow them to reach back 13 billion years to answer fundamental questions about the advent of the universe. The Thirty Meter Telescope project got approval to move forward last month. While it was the final legal step, opponents vowed to keep fighting and even get arrested if necessary to stop construction. Gov. David Ige said unarmed National Guard units will be used to transport personnel and supplies and enforce some road closures, but they will not be used in a law enforcement capacity during planned protests. “We just are asking people to be safe ... we certainly would ask that they be respectful of those who have to work on this project,” Ige said. “We certainly are being respectful of those who choose to voice their disagreement with the project — we understand that that’s important as well.” Four protesters held signs in the reception area of the governor’s office after officials announced construction plans. Protests at the mountain will be peaceful, Healani Sonoda-Pale said. Rhonda Vincent said closing the road to the mountain is like blocking access to a church. “If we can’t access our own gods, our own spirituality, isn’t that wrong?” she said. The American Civil Liberties Union of Hawaii sent a letter to Ige and other state officials expressing concern that the state recently purchased a long-range acoustic device known as a “sound gun” or “sound cannon.” The letter demanded that the state not use it for any anti-protest efforts or crowd control during telescope protests. Hawaii Attorney General Clare Connors said the device isn’t intended for any forceful use and will be used to communicate with large groups of people. Opponents say the $1.4 billion telescope will desecrate sacred land. Supporters say the cutting-edge instrument will bring educational and economic opportunities to Hawaii. “We aim to build the TMT for the benefit of all mankind and to understand the universe in which we all live,” said Henry Yang, chairman of the Thirty Meter Telescope International Observatory board of governors. A group of universities in California and Canada make up the telescope company, with partners from China, India and Japan. The instrument’s primary mirror would measure 98 feet (30 metres) in diameter. Compared with the largest existing visible-light telescope in the world, it would be three times as wide, with nine times more area. Plans for the project date to 2009, when scientists selected Mauna Kea after a five-year, around-the-world campaign to find the ideal site. It won a series of approvals from Hawaii, including a permit to build on conservation land in 2011. Protests disrupted a groundbreaking and Hawaiian blessing ceremony at the site in 2014. After that, the demonstrations intensified. Construction stopped in April 2015 after protesters were arrested for blocking the work. A second attempt to restart construction a few months later ended with more arrests and crews pulling back. The state Supreme Court upheld the project’s construction permit last year. Because the telescope is such a divisive issue in Hawaii, some say they’re afraid to publicly support the project because they fear blowback from activists. the divided opinions have been challenging, said David Lassner, president of the University of Hawaii, which is subleasing land near Mauna Kea’s summit to the telescope project. “There are also many, many people who see the benefits of the project, including many kanaka maoli,” he said, referring to Native Hawaiians. “Many of whom choose not to speak out in support but many of whom do want to see this project built for the contributions to human knowledge, for the contributions to education, for the contributions to the economy and the sheer impact of discovery.” It’s not yet clear what protesters plan to do. Kahookahi Kanuha, who has been arrested three times while protesting the project, said he’s not sure yet if he’ll go to Mauna Kea next week, but he hopes that a lot people do show up. “We all know this is a contentious issue. We all know people on all sides of it,” he said, adding that he wants supporters and opponents to remain committed to non-violence.

China, which claims self-ruled and democratic Taiwan as its own and views it as a wayward province, has called on the United States not to allow Tsai to transit there on her overseas tour. She is spending four nights in the United States in total, two on the way there and two on the way back on a visit to four Caribbean allies. Tsai will go to New York on her way there, and then is expected to stop in Denver on the way back. Tsai’s time in the United States will be unusually long, as normally she spends just a night at a time on transit stops. The U.S. State Department has said there had been no change in the U.S. “one-China” policy, under which Washington officially recognises Beijing and not Taipei, while assisting Taiwan. Speaking at Taipei’s main international airport at Taoyuan, Tsai said she would share the values of freedom and transparency with Taiwan’s allies, and she was looking forward to finding more international space for Taiwan. “Our democracy has not come easily, and is now facing threats and infiltration from overseas forces,” Tsai said, without naming any such force. “These challenges are also common challenges faced by democracies all over the world. We will work with countries with similar ideas to ensure the stability of the democratic system.” Tsai, who faces re-election in January, has repeatedly called for international support to defend Taiwan’s democracy in the face of Chinese threats. Beijing has regularly sent military aircraft and ships to circle Taiwan on drills in the past few years. Tsai last went to the United States in March, stopping over in Hawaii at the end of a Pacific tour. Seeking to bolster Taiwan’s defences, the United States this week approved an arms sale worth an estimated US$2.2-billion for Taiwan, despite Chinese criticism of the deal. Taiwan has been trying to shore up its diplomatic alliances amid pressure from China, which has been whittling down its few remaining diplomatic allies, especially in the Caribbean and Latin America. Aside from the United States, Tsai will be visiting St Vincent and the Grenadines, St Lucia, St Kitts and Nevis, and Haiti. Taiwan now has formal ties with only 17 countries, almost all small nations in Central America and the Pacific.

"540"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-chinas-repression-of-ethnic-uighurs-and-other-minorities-condemned-by/"|"Stephanie Nebehay"|"Nearly two dozen countries have called on China to halt its mass detention of ethnic Uyghurs in the Xinjiang region, the first such joint move on the issue at the UN Human Rights Council, according to diplomats and a letter seen by Reuters. UN experts and activists say at least 1 million Uyghurs and other Muslims are held in detention centres in the remote western region. China describes them as training centres helping to stamp out extremism and give people new skills. The unprecedented letter to the president of the forum, dated July 8, was signed by the ambassadors of 22 countries. Australia, Canada and Japan were among them, along with European countries including Britain, France, Germany and Switzerland, but not the United States which quit the forum a year ago. It fell short of a formal statement being read out at the Council or a resolution submitted for a vote, as sought by activists. This was due to governments’ fears of a potential political and economic backlash from China, diplomats said. “It is a first collective response on Xinjiang,” a Western diplomat told Reuters on Wednesday. “The idea of a resolution was never on the cards.” Another envoy said: “It’s a formal step because it will be published as an official document of the Council … It is a signal.” In a statement, Human Rights Watch later welcomed the letter as “important not only for Xinjiang’s population, but for people around the world who depend on the UN’s leading rights body to hold even the most powerful countries to account.” China’s Foreign Ministry said the letter “neglected the facts,” was a slander against China, an interference in the country’s internal affairs and the politicization of human rights. “China is strongly dissatisfied with resolutely opposed to this. We have already lodged stern representations with the relevant countries,” spokesman Geng Shuang told a daily news briefing in Beijing. China had taken successful steps against terror and extremism in Xinjiang, which has been broadly supported by the people of the region, he added. The letter voices concern at reports of unlawful detention in “large-scale places of detention, as well as widespread surveillance and restrictions, particularly targeting Uyghurs and other minorities in Xinjiang.” It pointedly cites China’s obligations as a member of the 47-member state forum to maintain the highest standards. “We call on China to uphold its national laws and international obligations and to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, including freedom of religion or belief in Xinjiang and across China,” the letter said. “We call also on China to refrain from the arbitrary detention and restrictions on freedom of movement of Uyghurs, and other Muslim and minority communities in Xinjiang.” The letter urges China to allow international independent experts, including UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet, “meaningful access” to Xinjiang. Bachelet, a former president of Chile, has pushed China to grant the United Nations access to investigate reports of disappearances and arbitrary detentions, particularly of Muslims in Xinjiang. China’s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva said last month that he hoped Bachelet would take up an invitation to visit. A UN spokeswoman said at the time that the trip, including “full access to Xinjiang,” was under discussion. No Western delegation was willing to take the lead and expose itself as a “ringleader” through a joint statement or resolution, diplomats said. China’s delegation is “hopping mad” at the move and is preparing its own letter, a diplomat said. At the start of the three-week session, which ends on Friday, the Xinjiang vice-governor responded to international condemnation of state-run detention camps by saying that they were vocational centres which had helped “save” people from extremist influences. China had now effectively contained terrorism and religious extremism in Xinjiang, Vice-Governor Erkin Tuniyaz told the council in an appearance that was sharply criticized by the United States.

Up to 200 banner-waving protesters outside the Old Bailey court in central London chanted slogans and clashed with police in riot gear when the sentence was announced. A large group then headed towards parliament, blocking roads and shouting “shame on you” at lawmakers inside. Yaxley-Lennon, 36, who goes by the name Tommy Robinson, was jailed for committing contempt of court after he filmed defendants during a trial last year and posted the footage on social media. He was found in contempt last week for breaching a reporting ban by videoing defendants accused of sexually exploiting young girls outside a courthouse in Leeds, northern England, while jurors were still considering their verdicts. “Today’s sentencing of Yaxley-Lennon serves to illustrate how seriously the courts will take matters of contempt,” said Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, the government’s chief legal adviser Yaxley-Lennon, who arrived at court wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the message “Convicted of Journalism” with the words “Britain = North Korea” on the back, was arrested in May last year for making the video recordings and jailed for 13 months later that day. However he successfully appealed against the conviction and was released. Cox decided to re-start contempt proceedings against him leading to the hearings last week where he was convicted. Judges said he had breached a court order, and his actions, aggressively confronting and filming some of the defendants, had created a substantial risk that “the course of justice in that case would be seriously impeded”. In her ruling, judge Victoria Sharp said that in his video Yaxley-Lennon, who argued he is highlighting cases ignored by mainstream media, “approves and encourages vigilante action” and his viewers would have understood it as “an incitement to engage in harassment of the defendants”. He was jailed for six months for the Leeds contempt and a further three months for a previous contempt of court. Yaxley-Lennon came to public attention as the co-founder of the English Defence League (EDL), a street movement which has staged demonstrations against Islam, and he is now one of Britain’s most high-profile far-right figures. Britain’s former counter-terrorism police chief cited him as a source of growing far-right extremism and the trial of a man found guilty of ramming a van into Muslim worshippers outside a London mosque in 2017 heard he had researched material in which Yaxley-Lennon featured.

"542"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-outpouring-of-support-in-russia-for-three-sisters-charged-with-killing/"|"Anna Rzhevkina"|"One summer night last year, sisters Krestina, Angelina and Maria Khachaturyan went into the room where their 57-year-old father Mikhail was sleeping and attacked him with pepper spray, a knife and a hammer. The sisters are now in trial for his murder, but thousands of people have come out in support of them, saying the sisters were defending themselves from an abusive father after being failed by a Russian legal system that, critics say, turns a blind eye to domestic abuse. The outpouring of support – over 230,000 people signed a petition asking to free the sisters from criminal charges – was in part because many women believe unless the system is changed, anyone could end up in their same situation. “I feel solidarity with the sisters,” said Anna Sinyatkina, a translator who was in a Moscow nightclub last week when about 200 people, mostly young women, gathered for a poetry evening in support of the sisters. “I feel that like them I can at any moment be put in a situation when there will be no one but me to protect my life, and I won’t get protection or a fair trial afterwards.” After killing their father in their Moscow apartment on the night of July 27, the Khachaturyan sisters, now aged 18, 19, and 20, called the police. Initially, they said they killed their father in self-defence when he was attacking them. Later, the investigation found that was not true, but that they had been subject to years of abuse by their father, including systematic beatings and violent sexual abuse, according to investigators’ documents seen by Reuters. The case has emerged at a time when many Russians believe protections for women abused in the home are being weakened. The European Court of Human Rights ruled on Tuesday Russia failed to protect another victim of domestic violence – a woman, who was assaulted, kidnapped and stalked by her former partner. In 2017 Russia decriminalized some forms of domestic violence. Under the new rules, the maximum punishment for someone who beats a member of their own family, causing bleeding or bruising, is a fine, as long as they do not repeat the offence more than once a year. The sisters’ lawyer, Alexei Parshin, said they were not demanding anonymity as victims of sexual abuse because the allegations about abuse were already in the public domain. The lawyer said the sisters, at the time of the killing, were suffering post-traumatic stress disorder. He said they considered running away but feared his retribution if they were caught. Their mother and father were separated. Parshin said the girls’ neighbours went to the police several times to report his violence against the sisters, but no criminal prosecution was ever brought against him. Moscow police and Russia’s Investigative Committee did not immediately reply to Reuters request for comments. “The situation in which the girls found themselves living with a father for a rapist is familiar and scary,” Alyona Popova, a lawyer and organizer of the petition told Reuters. “Many people, not only women, but also men in the Russian Federation realize that this is not an isolated case.” On July 6, activists staged protests in a square in the centre of Moscow, holding posters with the tag “I/We are the Khachaturyan sisters.” “In any civilized country, these girls would be in a psychotherapy clinic … but not in prison, no way,” said one of the protesters, Zara Mkhitaryan. Nearby there were counterprotesters. A handful of men standing with posters that read “Killers have no gender” and “Men’s state” – the name of a nationalist movement whose members believe men should dominate society.

Officials predicted Barry would make landfall Saturday morning near Morgan City as the first hurricane of the season, with the edges of the storm already lashing Louisiana with rain and leaving some coastal roads underwater. Though expected to be a weak hurricane, just barely over the 74 mph (119 kph) wind speed threshold, it threatened disastrous flooding across a swath of the Gulf Coast. The storm was expected to inflict the most damage on Louisiana and parts of Mississippi, with wind and rain affecting more than 3 million people. Late Friday night, residents received good news from forecasters: the Mississippi River is expected to crest in New Orleans at about 17.1 feet (5.2 metres) on Monday, not 19 feet (5.8 metres) as had been earlier predicted. The levees protecting the city range from about 20 to 25 feet (6 to 7.5 metres) in height. Governors declared emergencies in both states, and authorities took unprecedented precautions in closing floodgates and raising the barriers around New Orleans. Gov. John Bel Edwards said it was the first time all floodgates were sealed in the New Orleans-area Hurricane Risk Reduction System since Katrina. Still, he said he didn’t expect the Mississippi River to spill over the levees despite water levels already running abnormally high from heavy spring rains and melting snow upstream. “My concerns are just hoping it’s not going to be another Katrina,” said Donald Wells, a restaurant cook in New Orleans. Authorities told at least 10,000 people in exposed, low-lying areas along the Gulf Coast to leave, but no evacuations were ordered in New Orleans , where officials urged residents to “shelter in place.” Before they did, people packed stores to stock up on bottled water, food and other essentials. Lifelong New Orleans resident Terrence Williams grabbed supplies at a Costco, saying he has a few simple rules for big storms. “Stock up on water. Stock up food. Get ready for the storm — ride it out,” he said. Scott Daley, 55, manoeuvred two shopping carts filled with bottled water, gallons of milk and frozen meat at a Walmart in Lake Charles, in southwestern Louisiana. “I’ve got five small children at the house. So we’re just hunkering down,” he said. Forecasters said slow-moving Barry could unload 10 to 20 inches (25 to 50 centimetres) of rain through Sunday across a swath of Louisiana that includes New Orleans and Baton Rouge, as well as southwestern Mississippi, with pockets in Louisiana getting 25 inches (63 centimetres). “It’s powerful. It’s strengthening. And water is going to be a big issue,” National Hurricane Center Director Ken Graham warned. Workers also shored up and raised the levee system in places with beams, sheet metal and other barriers. Rescue crews and about 3,000 National Guard troops were posted around Louisiana with boats, high-water vehicles and helicopters. President Donald Trump declared a federal emergency for Louisiana, authorizing federal agencies to co-ordinate relief efforts. Scientists say global warming is responsible for more intense and more frequent storms and flooding, but without extensive study, they cannot directly link a single weather event to the changing climate. Tracking forecasts showed the storm moving toward Chicago, swelling the Mississippi River basin with water that must eventually flow south again. Before the worst of the storm, Kaci Douglas and her 15-year-old son, Juan Causey, were among dozens filling sandbags at a fire station in Baton Rouge. She planned to use them to shore up the door of her townhouse. “I told my son, it’s better to be safe than sorry,” she said. In New Orleans, a group of neighbours cleaned out the storm drains on their street. Working together to lift off the heavy metal covers, they discovered that most of the drains were full of dirt, leaves and garbage. All over town, people parked their cars on the city’s medians — referred to by locals as “neutral grounds” — in hopes their vehicles would be safe on the slightly elevated strips. After Katrina was blamed for more than 1,800 deaths, by some estimates, the Army Corps of Engineers began a multibillion-dollar hurricane-protection system that isn’t complete. The work included repairs and improvements to some 350 miles (560 kilometres) of levees and more than 70 pumping stations.

"544"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-europes-syphilis-rate-has-spiralled-70-per-cent-since-201/"|"Kate Kelland"|"Syphilis cases have soared in Europe over the last decade and become, for the first time since the early 2000s, more common in some countries than new cases of HIV, health experts said on Friday. Reported cases of the sexually transmitted disease are up by 70 per cent since 2010, a report from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) showed – with the rise driven by more unprotected sex and riskier sexual behaviour among gay men. “The increases in syphilis infections that we see across Europe ... are a result of several factors, such as people having sex without condoms and multiple sexual partners, combined with a reduced fear of acquiring HIV,” said Andrew Amato-Gauci, an ECDC expert on sexually transmitted infections. The European report comes after the World Health Organization said last month that around a million people each day worldwide catch a sexually transmitted infection. Left untreated, syphilis can have severe complications in men and women, including causing stillbirths and newborn deaths and increasing the risk of HIV. Syphilis was one of the leading causes of baby loss globally in 2016. The Stockholm-based ECDC, which monitors health and disease in Europe, said that overall, more than 260,000 syphilis cases were reported from 30 countries from 2007 to 2017. In 2017, syphilis rates reached an all-time high with more than 33,000 reported cases, the ECDC said. This meant that for the first time since the early 2000s, the region reported more cases of syphilis than new cases of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS. But the problem varied significantly by country, with rates more than doubling in five countries – Britain, Germany, Ireland, Iceland and Malta – but dropping by 50 per cent or more in Estonia and Romania. Close to two-thirds of the cases reported between 2007 and 2017 where sexual orientation was known were in men who have sex with men, the ECDC report said, while heterosexual men contributed 23 per cent of cases and women 15 per cent. The proportion of cases diagnosed among men who have sex with men ranged from less than 20 per cent in Latvia, Lithuania and Romania to more than 80 per cent in France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden and Britain. Amato-Gauci said complacency among men who have gay sex and seem unconcerned about HIV risks appeared to be fuelling the problem. “To reverse this trend, we need to encourage people to use condoms consistently with new and casual partners,” he said.

The company acknowledged that humans can access those recordings after some of its Dutch language audio snippets were leaked. Google product manager David Monsees acknowledged the leak in a blog post Thursday, and said the company is investigating the breach. “We are conducting a full review of our safeguards in this space to prevent misconduct like this from happening again,” he wrote. More than 1,000 recordings were obtained by Belgian broadcaster VRT NWS, which noted in a story that some contained sensitive personal conversations – as well as information that identified the person speaking. Google says no user account information is associated with the recordings, and reviewers are instructed not to transcribe background conversations. But VRT reporters could hear spoken home addresses in some of the recordings, and were able to track down the speakers. Some of these conversations were not directed at Assistant and happened either as background noise or as a mistaken recording when Assistant thought it was being spoken to, but wasn’t. Google did not immediately respond to a request for further comment. Google says contractors listen to recordings to better understand language patterns and accents. Its user terms confirm recordings may be used by the company, stating Assistant “records your voice and audio on Google services to improve speech recognition.” Monsees wrote that Google works with contractors around the world to analyze the recordings. “These language experts review and transcribe a small set of queries to help us better understand those languages,” he wrote. Google’s terms don’t explicitly say that people review the recordings, but do state that data could be analyzed as the company updates services or create new features. The company acknowledged earlier this year that its reviewers listen to anonymous recordings in response to a Bloomberg report revealing that Amazon’s Alexa also uses contractors to listen to recordings. Amazon confirmed the report. Google’s recording feature can be turned off, but doing so means Assistant loses some of its personalized touch. People who turn off the recording feature lose the ability for the Assistant to recognize individual voices and learn your voice pattern. Assistant recording is actually turned off by default – but the technology prompts users to turn on recording and other tools in order to get personalized features. Google Assistant is available on more than 1 billion devices, including smartphones and smart speakers. It’s made quite a dent in the smart speaker market – still the primary place where people use voice technology – but still trails behind Amazon.

That was two years after the opening of Elka’s, her highly praised restaurant at the Miyako Hotel in the Japantown neighbourhood of San Francisco. Ms. Gilmore, who often wore a baseball cap in the kitchen, welcomed new methods while holding on tightly to traditional ones. “I do not think roux is a dirty word,” she once said, referring to the classic French mix of flour and fat. What she learned from both French and Japanese chefs and dishes, she told the Times two years later, was an appreciation of raw ingredients and flavour relationships. Adding a supposedly exotic ingredient just for effect made no sense to her. “I don’t really know what ‘fusion’ means,” she said, “but I do know that you can’t just throw some ginger or seaweed into a dish without a good reason in terms of how the flavours and textures work.” Articles about her were often accompanied by recipes – for the likes of soba noodles tossed with ginger and caviar; striped bass with roasted shallot and garlic purée; or sturgeon and calamari roasted with fava beans, ginger butter and a preserved plum vinaigrette. A founder of the organization Women Chefs and Restaurateurs, she never attended culinary school. Elka Ruth Gilmore was born on March 17, 1960, in San Antonio, Tex., the only child of Russell Stanley Gilmore, a college professor, and Linda (Prinz) Gilmore. When Elka was around 12, she took her first restaurant job, as a dishwasher, at Café Camille in Austin, Tex. At 16, she ran away from home, moving in with her grandmother in Wisconsin and cooking wherever she could. She was employed as a prep cook at L’Étoile in Madison when the chef quit; Ms. Gilmore, still a teenager, was promptly promoted to chef. At 18, she decided it was time to travel and learn. So she headed for Boston, New York and ultimately the south of France, where she worked at the world-famous La Colombe d’Or. Returning to the United States in 1982, she settled in Los Angeles, where she spent time at the restaurants Tumbleweed and Checkers. As an owner of another one, Camelion’s, she found she had much less time to cook. Running a restaurant required innovation. “In my case, I was just sort of naive,” she said in a 1990 interview that appeared in The South Florida Sun Sentinel. “But now I know what it’s like to have to sell your car to make payroll.” Ms. Gilmore developed strong feelings about her chosen profession, and about the restaurant industry. “I realize that I didn’t want to cook what I didn’t want to cook,” she told the food critic Ruth Reichl in an interview for The Los Angeles Times in 1989, when she was working at Palette in West Hollywood. “That I didn’t want to have to be nice to people I didn’t like.” And she didn’t have to. After the success of Elka’s, her next San Francisco project – Liberté, a French-American restaurant – lasted only a few months in 1995. But that same year, she won the James Beard Foundation’s award for best California chef, and the East Coast called. The Omni Berkshire Place Hotel lured her to New York to create and run Kokachin, a lobby-level seafood restaurant. Every visit, Ms. Reichl wrote in a review in The New York Times, was “a little journey of discovery.” Ms. Gilmore soon returned to San Francisco, where in 1998 she opened her last restaurant, Oodles, a bistro on Mission Street. It closed the same year. She leaves her father and a half brother, Joseph Gabriel. Ms. Gilmore was known for creating carefully assembled, time-consuming dishes, and for her food’s interplay of taste and texture. But she maintained a certain humility. Shortly after her arrival in Manhattan, she told the Times that she was “shocked to discover how hip my food was.” "|"Elka Gilmore, chef who blended the old and the new, dies at 59"|"2019-07-14T15:32:50-0400"|"obituary,death,Elka Gilmore,world news,chef,cook,time,gilmore,restaurant,food,elka,ginger,fusion,times,Ruth Reichl", 
"548"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-facebook-knew-changes-it-made-were-pushing-users-to-spend-more-time/"|"Tamsin McMahon"|"Facebook knew that changes it made in its platform to increase audience engagement were pushing its users to spend more time sharing viral content, years before its social-media platform helped to trigger a wave of fake news and hate speech in the digital world. In an internal Facebook presentation from 2014 that was leaked to journalists from Britain and shared with The Globe and Mail, employees discuss how the company’s shift from desktop to mobile over the previous two years had changed the way users interacted with the platform. Facebook altered its platform in 2012 and 2013 to make it easier for people to share content from their phones and to encourage users spend more time liking, commenting on and re-sharing posts. The changes came at a time when Facebook was going public and was looking for ways to improve its business model, internal company e-mails show. The social-media firm started running ads in its news feed in 2012. To encourage users to spend more time on Facebook, the Silicon Valley company said it would focus on making its news feed more personalized and would prioritize the most engaging content – posts that had received large numbers of likes, shares and comments “from the world at large and from your friends in particular.” Several online publishers, including sites such as Buzzfeed, saw a surge in referral traffic from Facebook as the social-media company made it easier to encourage the sharing of viral posts. Critics and researchers have long warned that the social-media company’s efforts to encourage people to spend more time on the platform – in order to show them more advertisements – have helped encourage the spread of misinformation and shaped the opinions of online audiences. The details of the company’s internal discussions are contained in documents sealed by a California court as part of a lawsuit involving Facebook and app developer Six4Three. Some of the documents were seized by a British parliamentary committee investigating the company, which published 250 pages of the court file late last year. Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the latest release of leaked documents Sunday. However, the company has previously said that the court documents, which date from 2012 through 2015, had been “cherry-picked” from the lawsuit and did not reflect the full scope of internal discussions at the company. “The set of documents, by design, tells only one side of the story and omits important context." Years later, Facebook now finds itself at the centre of a widespread backlash over the algorithms that social-media platforms use to prioritize and recommend content that have helped undermine democratic elections, and spread hate speech and misinformation online. Aiming to combat the spread of hate speech, disinformation and political extremism online, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg announced a sweeping overhaul of Facebook’s news-feed ranking system last year to prioritize posts from friends over publishers and brands. But the social-media giant had early warning signs that changes to its news feed were influencing user behaviour. According to the internal presentation, when employees studied the effects of the changes in 2014, they noticed people were re-sharing dramatically more posts, but were writing fewer status updates and other text posts. “When we turned up re-shares in the system, text posts fell,” the presentation says. “Correlation does not always imply causation – but it does in this case.” The changes had been only partly rolled back by 2014, the document notes, but does not specify which changes had been reversed. Employees also noticed that the posts people were writing seemed to be influenced by the kind of content they were seeing on their feed. The data suggested that while people often decided in advance if they wanted to post a photo to Facebook, written posts tended to happen more spontaneously – with people only deciding to write a message after reading something they had come across on Facebook. “Unlike photos, text posts are malleable and can be ‘triggered’ by what users see in feed,” the company wrote. About 7,000 documents from the court file were first reported by digital magazine Computer Weekly, NBC and freelance investigative journalist Duncan Campbell. The Globe viewed more than 300 pages of those documents. The social-media firm has also been a flashpoint in the global regulatory debate over data privacy after political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed personal information on tens of millions of users. On Friday, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission reportedly approved a record US$5-billion fine against Facebook over how it handled the personal information of its more than two billion users. The settlement is also expected to come with closer regulatory oversight of Facebook’s data privacy practices. Facebook had previously said it anticipated being fined between $3-billion and US$5-billion.

His work at Bletchley Park, Britain’s wartime code-breaking centre, was credited with shortening the war and saving many thousands of lives. But he was stripped of his job and chemically castrated after being convicted of gross indecency in 1952 for having sex with a man. Homosexual sex was illegal in Britain until 1967. Turing killed himself in 1954, at the age of 41, with cyanide. He was granted a royal pardon by the Queen in 2013 for the criminal conviction that led to his suicide. Rights campaigner Peter Tatchell, who campaigned for Turing’s pardon and organized LGBTQ activists to vote for him in an early round of nominations for the banknote selection, said it was a breakthrough to have a known gay person appear on an English banknote for the first time. “This is a much deserved accolade for one of the greatest minds of the twentieth century,” Mr. Tatchell said. A 2014 film, The Imitation Game, starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Turing, won an Oscar for best adapted screenplay. In 2017, under new legislation known as “Turing’s Law,” Britain granted posthumous pardons to thousands of gay and bisexual men who were convicted of sexual offences under laws that have since been abolished. As well as an image of Turing, the new note will feature a table and mathematical formulae from a 1936 paper by Turing on computable numbers, an image of a pilot computer and technical drawings for the machines used to break the Enigma code. The note will also include a quote by Turing about the rise of machine intelligence: “This is only a foretaste of what is to come, and only the shadow of what is going to be.” The £50 note is the BoE’s highest-value banknote and is rarely used in daily transactions. The new note is expected to enter circulation by the end of 2021, the BoE said.

"550"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-businesses-struggle-in-sri-lanka-as-tourism-industry-continues-to-feel/"|"Aditi Shah Shihar Aneez"|"Pearl Divers, a diving school on one of Sri Lanka’s most popular southern beaches, shut shop for two months after suicide bombers attacked churches and hotels on the island on Easter Sunday, killing about 250 people. It had no customers as tourists cancelled holidays, and its manager Nuwan Harshana says he took two months leave and a pay cut. Last week, he dusted off the diving equipment and boats, used to carry scuba enthusiasts off the shore of Unawatuna beach, in the hope that foreigners will start to trickle into the country again and the shop can slowly build back to the $800 a day in revenue it made before the attacks. But there is no sign of any quick upturn in his fortunes. “Everything was good before April. Now that situation is finished … there are no customers,” said Harshana, who said he is worried about earning enough to look after his wife and two children, while also meeting his monthly loan payments. The economy of Sri Lanka, a sun-drenched island in the Indian Ocean, depends heavily on the $4.4-billion tourism industry. Small businesses like Pearl Divers have been on the rise since the nation’s civil war ended in 2009 and tourists poured in. But after the bombings in April, tourist arrivals slumped 70 per cent in May and 57 per cent in June from a year earlier. Many small businesses, that employ thousands, are now either forced to lay off staff or have them work for minimal pay. This is already having a domino effect on the economy, further hitting consumer demand. The government has introduced a series of measures to boost tourism, including lowering airport charges, cutting taxes on jet fuel and pushing hotels to offer discounts. It is planning to relax visa rules for residents of a number of countries. It has also asked banks to lower lending rates and give loan moratoriums. But the relief is yet to reach many small businesses that make up the backbone of the economy. “Clearly it took banks a bit of time to gear up for it … As they had to work out the decision making process,” central bank governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy said on Thursday. Dilum Ranjana, who owns a foot spa in the fort city of Galle in the south, said he had to fire three of seven employees and postpone plans to open a second branch because he was getting hardly any income in the past couple of months. “It is not easy to get a loan, there is a lot of paperwork and bureaucracy,” said Ranjana, who has monthly expenses of $2,300 in rent, bills and salaries. He said he has so far made $570 in July, a tenth of what he did last year. “All my plans are lost, they are ruined,” he said. Tourism was the third largest and fastest growing source of foreign currency for Sri Lanka last year, and accounted for 4.9 per cent of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2018. The government expects a shortfall of $800-900 million in tourism revenue this year, which will widen its current account deficit to 3 per cent of GDP from the 2.3 per cent it had earlier expected, a top central bank official told Reuters. The central bank has also slashed its growth forecast for the year to 3 per cent from 4 per cent earlier. “The main concern is rising non-performing loans due to sluggish economic growth after the attacks,” the official said. When the diving business was booming, Harshana said he took a loan of $57,000 in 2017 to convert an old house into a no-frills hostel which earned him $114 a night from tourists in peak season. It is currently closed because he has no bookings. After letting him postpone loan payments of $630 for both May and June, the bank is giving no such concession for July, he said. “I have to manage with my savings but I don’t have much. People like us, we rise slowly but the fall is sudden,” he said. The island received 2.5 million foreign tourists last year and with Lonely Planet magazine endorsing it as 2019’s top destination, the government was hoping to draw in more than 3 million this year. It now hopes to get around 2 million tourists, said Johanne Jayaratne, chairman of the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority. Airlines cancelled 41 weekly flights after the attacks and while carriers like Emirates have resumed their schedule, China Eastern, for instance, is still operating only four flights a week – half of what it used to. G.W. Ramyasiri, a 57-year-old fisherman who poses for tourists while propped up on a pole in Kogalla lake near Galle, says the government is not providing enough help. He says he used to make up to $20 in tips from tourists every day before the attacks, now he barely makes a dollar. He said he has sold the family gold and may not be able to send his younger daughter to university. “We need money, not loans. If tourists don’t come back, how will I repay the loan?” asked Ramyasiri. “They have actually bombed us and our livelihoods.” Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day’s most important headlines.

UN officials and donors met in Geneva to discuss how to tackle the world’s second worst epidemic, which has infected 2,500 people and killed 1,655 in the lush farmlands of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. A toxic mix of armed militias and a deep-rooted mistrust of health officials by communities have hampered efforts to halt the virus. Goma, a lakeside city more than 350 kilometres (220 miles) south of where the outbreak was first detected, got its first case on Sunday. That raised fears Ebola could accelerate into one of Africa’s most densely populated areas and over the Rwanda border. “The case in Goma could potentially be a game-changer in this epidemic,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told the meeting. “It is a gateway to the region and the world.” The patient who brought Ebola to Goma was a priest who became infected during a visit to the town of Butembo, 200 km (124 miles) north of Goma, where he interacted with Ebola patients, Congo’s health ministry said in a statement. He was taken back to a clinic in Butembo on Monday. “Due to the speed with which the patient has been identified and isolated, as well as the identification of all bus passengers from Butembo, the risk of spreading to the rest of the city of Goma remains low,” the ministry said. WHO emergencies chief Mike Ryan said they had identified 60 contacts, including 18 who were on the bus with the priest, and half of them have been vaccinated. Goma had been preparing for the arrival of Ebola for a year, setting up handwashing stations and making sure moto-taxi drivers do not share helmets. “There is a grave risk of a major increase in numbers, or spread to new locations – as we’ve heard today in Goma,” said Josie Golding, a specialist on epidemics at the Wellcome Trust global health charity. Ebola causes diarrhea, vomiting and hemorrhagic fever and can be spread through bodily fluids. An epidemic between 2013 and 2016 killed more than 11,300 people in West Africa. While the technology for fighting it, including vaccines and special treatment units, is better than ever, trust between health workers and the community is low – and militia violence is preventing them from accessing remote areas. Unidentified attackers killed two Ebola health workers near Mukulia in North Kivu province over the weekend, the latest in a string of assaults this year that have injured or killed dozens of responders. “Every attack gives Ebola an opportunity to spread. Ebola gets a free ride,” Ghebreyesus said. Apart from insecurity, the biggest challenge is money, officials said. “If we don’t raise more resources … it is not going to be possible to bring this outbreak under control,” the UN’s humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock told Reuters. “The need is for money, not next week, or next month or later in the year. The need is for money now.” Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day’s most important headlines. Sign up today.

"552"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-workers-recover-hundreds-of-bodies-from-mass-grave-in-syria/"|""|"In an open field on the outskirts of the Syrian city of Raqqa, workers in black uniforms, surgical masks and red hardhats toil under a scorching sun to dig up bodies from a large mass grave discovered last month. They have so far unearthed 313 bodies from the grave since it was discovered last month, the official said. All of the dead are men, women and children believed to have been killed or died during the Islamic State group’s rule over the northern city, once the de facto capital of the extremist group’s so-called Islamic caliphate and the site of atrocities committed by the group against residents who opposed its extremist ideology. The group at the time commanded large swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq that it administered based on its own radical version of Islamic rule. U.S.-backed Syrian forces retook Raqqa from IS in 2017 after a lengthy campaign that left the city in ruins. Since then, an organization known as the Civil Council of Raqqa has been working to uncover mass graves in and around the city, amid concerns about the preservation of bodies and evidence for possible war crimes trials. International human rights groups say they are concerned that local groups are not getting the support they need in terms of forensic expertise and human resources. Yasser al-Khamees, who leads a team of first responders, said workers have unearthed 4,760 bodies from a series of mass graves starting from January 2018. The mass grave discovered in mid-June in al-Fukheikha agricultural fields south of the city is the latest grave located in and around Raqqa to date. An Associated Press video showed workers on a recent day wearing surgical masks using shovels to dig up bodies from the field. Forensic workers then put the remains in white body bags, marking them with the date and location and other details. Asaad Mohammed, a forensic worker, said workers were exhuming an average of 10 to 12 bodies on daily basis. “We inspect the body, identify the sex, age, time of death, cause of death. We take samples from each body and give it a number, we document it on official papers and then save the information on a computer database along with samples taken from this area,” he said. The bodies are then reburied in another plot of land outside the city for future identification.

"553"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-white-supremacist-convicted-in-charlottesville-car-attack-faces-second/"|"Denise Lavoie"|"An avowed white supremacist was sentenced to life in prison plus 419 years Monday for deliberately driving his car into a crowd of anti-racism protesters during a rally in Virginia, killing one woman and injuring dozens. James Alex Fields Jr., 22, remained stoic as Circuit Court Judge Richard Moore formally imposed the recommendation of a state jury that convicted him in December of murder and malicious wounding charges for his actions in Charlottesville on Aug. 12, 2017. Fields showed no visible emotion as victims of the car attack described severe physical and psychological injuries — broken bones, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression — inflicted by Fields when he plowed his car into them. “Hello, scum,” said Jeanne “Star” Peterson, as she addressed Fields, seated about 20 feet from her at a table with his lawyers. Peterson, who suffered a broken spine and a shattered right leg in the attack, told Fields he needs to stop “verbally abusing” his mother, referring to a recorded jail conversation in which Fields can be heard disparaging his mother. Peterson said Fields’ mother “tried her best” and it’s not her fault her son “turned out to be a piece of feces.” Marcus Martin, who was captured in a dramatic photo as Fields’ car struck him, said anger over what Fields did has permeated his life and affected his marriage. “I blow up at the smallest things,” Martin said, before ordering Fields to look at him. “I want to talk to you, dude. I need you to look at me, buddy — look at me,” he said. It was unclear whether Fields made eye contact with Martin. He said closure will only come when he finds out “James Alex Fields is no longer on this Earth.” Martin was with several friends, including 32-year-old paralegal and civil rights activist Heather Heyer, when Fields rammed the crowd. A photo of the car tossing Martin and other counterprotesters into the air won a Pulitzer Prize. In the photo, Martin wears a white shirt, khaki shorts, and red and white sneakers as he hangs above the ground behind the car. Heyer’s mother, Susan Bro, said in brief remarks to the judge that she hopes Fields finds “reclamation” but also hopes “he never sees the light of day outside of prison.” Last month, Fields received a life sentence on 29 federal hate crime charges. In his remarks before sentencing, Moore acknowledged Fields’ long history of mental health issues, beginning when he was institutionalized several times as a child. But he said Fields had received psychological treatment throughout his life and his mental health issues do not excuse his crimes. The judge also said there was no evidence that Fields was being threatened or attacked when he drove into the counterprotesters. “Mr. Fields, you had choices. We all have choices,” Moore said. “You made the wrong ones and you caused great harm. ... You caused harm around the globe when people saw what you did.” Fields, an avowed white supremacist who kept a photo of Adolf Hitler on his bedside table, drove from his home in Maumee, Ohio, to attend the rally, which drew hundreds of white nationalists to Charlottesville to protest the planned removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. The event also drew counterprotesters who demonstrated against the white nationalists. Violent skirmishes between the two sides prompted police to declare an unlawful assembly and to order the groups to disband before the rally could even begin. Later that day, Fields plowed his car into a crowd of counterprotesters. The event stirred racial tensions across the country. President Donald Trump sparked controversy when he blamed violence at the rally on “both sides,” a statement that critics saw as a refusal to condemn racism. During Fields’ state trial, his attorneys said he was afraid after seeing violent skirmishes between white nationalists and counterprotesters. They also focused on his history of mental illness and traumatic childhood.

"554"|"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-britain-sees-small-window-to-save-nuclear-deal-iran-urges-europe-to/"|"John Irish Daphne Psaledakis"|"The remaining parties to the Iran nuclear deal do not see Tehran’s breaches as significant and do not intend for now to trigger the pact’s dispute mechanism, preferring more diplomacy to ease the crisis, the European Union foreign policy chief said on Monday. Federica Mogherini spoke at the end of an EU foreign ministers meeting after Britain said there was only a “small window” of time to salvage the deal, while Iran warned it would ramp up uranium enrichment if the EU failed to do more to that end. U.S.-Iranian tensions have escalated since U.S. President Donald Trump decided last year to abandon the nuclear deal under which Iran agreed to curtail its atomic program in return for relief from economic sanctions crippling its economy. The EU ministers drew no conclusions on what action should next be taken to head off a feared U.S.-Iranian conflict. But by suggesting that Iran’s non-compliance was not significant, it could anger the United States, which last week warned it would intensify sanctions on Iran over its breaches, and it did prompt an immediate outcry from Israel, Iran’s regional arch-enemy. “For the time being, none of the parties to the agreement has signalled their intention to invoke this article,” Ms. Mogherini told a news conference in Brussels, referring to a mechanism to punish non-compliance. “[It] means that none of them for the moment, for the time being with the current data we have had in particular from the [UN nuclear watchdog] IAEA, [consider Iran’s] non-compliance … to be significant non-compliance.” IAEA inspectors last week confirmed Iran is now enriching uranium to 4.5-per-cent fissile purity, above the 3.67-per-cent limit set by its deal, the second breach in as many weeks after Tehran exceeded limits on its stock of low enriched uranium. The level at which Iran is now refining uranium is still well below the 20-per-cent purity of enrichment Iran reached before the deal and the 90 per cent needed to yield bomb-grade nuclear fuel. Low-enriched uranium provides fuel for civilian power plants. British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said earlier in the day that Iran remained “a good year away from developing a nuclear bomb.” He told reporters in Brussels: “There is still some closing, but small, window to keep the deal alive.” Under the terms of the deal, if any party believes another is not upholding their commitments, they can refer the issue to a Joint Commission comprising Iran, Russia, China, the three European powers, and the EU. This activates a dispute mechanism that could eventually end with a restoration of global, UN sanctions against Iran. Ms. Mogherini said a joint commission meeting was possible, although when and at what level had yet to be decided. She indicated that for now, the EU would focus on diplomatic efforts to save the nuclear deal, which signatories in 2015 touted as essential to ward off the risk of a wider Middle East war jeopardizing global energy supplies. “The deal is not in good health, but it’s still alive. We hope and we invite Iran to reverse these steps and go back to full compliance with the agreement,” Ms. Mogherini, adding that they were all reversible. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the EU’s response on Monday, saying it recalled failed diplomacy with Nazi Germany in the run-up to the Second World War. “[It] reminds me of the European appeasement of the 1930s,” Mr. Netanyahu said in a video statement. “Then, too, there were those who stuck their head in the sand and did not see the approaching danger,” said Mr. Netanyahu, who has often cast Iran’s nuclear projects as a mortal menace to Israel and the wider world. Iran denies seeking a nuclear bomb. The Brussels gathering had been called to flesh out ways of convincing Iran and the U.S. to reduce tensions and start a dialogue amid fears the 2015 deal is close to collapse. Fears of direct U.S.-Iranian conflict have risen since May with several attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf, Iran’s downing of a U.S. surveillance drone and a plan for U.S. air strikes on Iran last month that Mr. Trump called off at the last minute. In reaction to the reimposition of tough U.S. sanctions, which have notably targeted Iran’s vital oil revenue stream, Tehran has cut some of its nuclear commitments under the deal. That led the European parties to the pact, France, Britain and Germany, to warn Tehran not to shred the deal’s terms. Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom suggested the Europeans would leave the door open for diplomacy but that Tehran should exercise restraint. “It improves their chances of having a good discussion with the EU and other partners in the JCPOA [Iran deal],” she told reporters. “We encourage them to use all diplomatic means and create new diplomatic channels … to de-escalate the tense situation. We have to use every opportunity to keep the deal.” The Islamic Republic’s nuclear energy agency said Tehran would return to the situation before the nuclear deal unless European countries fulfilled their obligations. “These actions are not taken out of stubbornness but to give diplomacy a chance,” agency spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi said. “And if the Europeans and America don’t want to fulfill their commitments we will create a balance in this deal by reducing commitments and return the situation to four years ago.” Iran says the European countries must do more to guarantee it the trade and investment dividends it was due to receive in return for UN-monitored limits to its nuclear capacity under the deal. The Europeans are also trying to set up Instex, a barter-based trade conduit with Iran, but an equivalent Iranian mechanism has yet to start. Should the mechanism go ahead it would initially only deal in products such as pharmaceuticals and foods, which are not subject to U.S. sanctions. Ms. Mogherini also said the shareholders of Instex, which now includes 10 EU members, were considering whether to include oil, something that until now has been ruled out given the threat of U.S. blowback. Iran has said Instex must include oil sales or provide substantial credit facilities for it to be beneficial.
