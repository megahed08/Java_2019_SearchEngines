Since then, the country has been in turmoil, with a wave of protests putting the president under growing pressure. Analysts doubt the country will stabilize anytime soon. Juan Ramon Martinez, a commentator for daily La Tribuna, recently wrote that there is ""no light at the end of the tunnel."" For weeks, teachers and doctors have expressed their dismay at the government's planned cuts in the education and health care sectors. Gerardo Martinez, of the Association for Freedom and Democracy, says Hernandez' authoritarian and self-righteous style of governing is a problem. He has accused Hernandez of ruthlessly pushing though his plans and breaching the law and the principles of democracy. In a forthright letter published in early June, the Honduran Bishops' Conference sided with the protesters, declaring that ""if every conflict is managed this poorly, Honduras will find itself amid a severe crisis."" Read more: Caught between floods and drought ― farmers in Nicaragua living in uncertainty Honduras has seen weeks of protests against the Hernandez government Controversial cuts Educators and health care workers say the controversial presidential decrees amount to an express permission to drastically cut expenditures, privatize their respective industries and fire individuals for holding certain political views. Soon after taking to streets, they were joined by disgruntled farmers, and taxi and truck drivers. And most recently, the Honduran police joined the protests, too, demanding the state provide uniforms, pay for petrol and grant them holidays - things they are officially entitled. After footage of riots, barricaded streets, masked police officers and firebombs outside the US embassy went around the word, Hernandez caved in. He withdrew his decrees and offered to engage in dialogue with the protesters. Calls for him to step down, however, have been growing louder. And even his own party and his predecessor, ex-President Porfirio Lobo, have urged him to resign. The root cause of the present crisis, meanwhile, can be traced back several years. In 2009, popular left-wing president Manuel Zelaya was ousted by an alliance of businesses, the military and lawmakers from the National Party of Honduras (PNH). Ever since then, Zelaya has been out to exact revenge for the coup. Conservatives in Honduras, meanwhile, regard Zelaya as a communist, and have been determined to prevent his return to power. ""It's a dichotomy the country has been stuck in since then like a swamp|"" said Gerardo Martinez. In 2017, for example, Hernandez was re-elected after scrapping the constitutional ban on running for a second term 抑 reportedly with the assistance of bribed parliamentarians. And observers have pointed out vote counting irregularities during the election itself. Protesters are tired of the Hernandez administration's neoliberal policies US backs Honduran leader Juan Ramon Martinez says that Hernandez depends on the country's military and the United States government to maintain his grip on power. Indeed, on Friday the president welcomed US marines at Palmerola Air Base near the Honduran capital, Tegucigalpa. They will help fight the country's youth gangs and drug cartels. Surrounded by top military brass, Hernandez also announced that the country's security forces will be deployed across Honduras to combat vandalism and to clear road blocks. Journalist Noe Leyva, meanwhile, does not believe Hernandez will step down any time soon, saying that ""no change is in sight as long as he has the backing of the US and the army."" Hernandez is a loyal US ally ― even though his own brother is on trial in the US for drug smuggling. Hernandez is giving US forces free reign in Honduras, and has not objected to the harsh treatment of Honduran migrants at the hands of the American border personnel. The US welcomes Hernandez' neoliberal, free-market policies and sees him as a capable leader. Since taking power, the Honduran economy has grown by an average 3.5% each year. Hernandez has reduced the national debt-to-GDP ratio from 7.9% to just 1.2%. And thanks to substantial investments in the security sector, the country's murder rate has almost halved over the past six years, falling from 87 per 100,000 residents in 2011 to 44 in 2017. But ordinary Hondurans are barely benefiting from the economic upswing. Half of the population is without a permanent job, and roughly 60% live below the poverty line. Street vendors tell DW that electricity and transport costs are high, and that youth gangs extort money from them. Corruption and impunity are rampant, which undermines the country's institutions. According to the Latin American Geopolitics Strategy Research Institute, or CELAG, the country's economy simultaneously produces growth and impoverishment. The Honduran Bishops' Conference believes the county is at a crossroads. In its unusually frank letter, the organization criticizes that the ""constitution is amended arbitrarily, the country's institutions are not independent, Congress is sham parliament, and lawmakers are turning their backs on the people. Enough is enough."""|"Thousands of Hondurans are taking to the streets, calling for President Juan Orlando Hernandez to step down.

But has last weekend's bloodshed extinguished the glimmer of hope that Ethiopia was on the path toward becoming a united, democratic country? It's hard to say at this stage. So far, only Ethiopia's authorities are calling the bloodshed a ""coup"" attempt. But the orchestrated operation in the killing of five high-ranking military officers raises serious questions about Ethiopia's ability to evolve into a stable democracy. Failure at first One thing seems certain: The elections, which were planned for May 2020, will not go ahead. Indeed, even the nationwide census, which had been planned as a litmus test prior to the vote, was called off. This means the electorate will not be able to democratically legitimize Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's reform agenda, as he had so dearly hoped. And it is not the only area in which the new strongman appears weak. Ethnic tensions persist throughout the land, and with millions of internally-displaced people, the proud nation provides the setting for Africa's biggest refugee crisis. Is governing even possible with such a powerless leader at the helm? Well, there is another interpretation, now that the country's deeply rooted ethnic chauvinism has reared its ugly head for all to see. The prime minister — who took office on a ticket of reconciliation — may seek to rule with an iron fist. Abiy loyalists are set to be installed in key positions in Ethiopia's regions, the military and secret service. The young reformer has finally replaced grotesque naivete with the ""road map"" Ethiopian citizens have long since demanded. Send Facebook Twitter google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/3I5th 'Emperor Abiy?' Ultimately, supporters of this theory predict, the head of government will become something of an absolute monarch with complete power. This would not even come as a surprise, given that he has flirted with the idea of extensive presidential powers before. Fortunately, for now, this remains just one possible, albeit worrying, scenario. And one should not pretend Ethiopia is imminently facing a return to old, authoritarian times. But if Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's ""new horizon"" reform agenda is to bear fruit, he will have to govern with greater determination. And maintain support for the project among the estimated 105 million Ethiopians, even beyond ethnic lines.

A little later Ethiopia's army chief of staff, Seare Mekonnen, and a retired general were killed by Seare's own bodyguard — an attack that Ethiopia's government believes to be related. All of this was reported by the office of the prime minister, including announcements by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed himself, or state media. Since Saturday internet lines have been cut and state-run media have been the primary source of information. While neither the opposition nor independent local media houses have commented on the events, government spokesperson, Billene Seyoum Woldeyes confirmed the government stance to DW. ""General Asaminew Tsige was behind the coup attempt within the regional government of Amhara|"" she said. ""Since yesterday, there has been an ongoing operation to arrest those who are responsible."" State sources have reported that General Asaminew was shot dead outside Bahir Dar on Monday. Ethiopian army chief General Seare Mekonnen (left.) was killed following the 'coup attempt' What lead to the attacks? What isn't clear until now is why this weekend's events took place. Ethiopia has been rocked by regional and political tension. Since he has come into power just over a year ago, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has cracked down on high-ranking military personnel allegedly involved in corruption, torture, and other crimes, but disputes within in the army seem not to be the main reason for the so-called coup attempt. ""This coup attempt showed that there are different tendencies within the army|"" explained Annette Weber, a researcher with the Berlin-based Institute for International and Security Affairs. ""It's of course true hat Abiy didn't make many friends by sacking the officials, but these people are apparently not the people who orchestrated this attack|"" she told DW.

In a wave of prisoner releases by Abiy, Asaminew was set free after nine years in prison and had now served as the head of the Amhara region's security forces. Former Prime Minister Meles Zenawi had arrested the former Brigadier General in the Ethiopian air force for allegedly planning a coup in 2009. In the past weeks, Asaminew had called on the Amhara people to take up arms. ""What we're seeing is that these more radical voices, which were formerly suppressed, are now coming to the forefront|"" Weber told DW. Ethiopia analyst Awol Allo from the University of Keele in the UK, agreed that the ethnic tension was to blame. ""It is known that there is a tension in the Amhara region between those who want to go for a different direction|"" he told DW. Some, such as Asaminew, wanted to advance Amhara nationalist views. ""There are some who would like to work with the central government to make it more harmonious. It is known that this controversy between them becomes worse from time to time. I think this is the cause of the current problem."" Quoting an official, Reuters news agency reported that the official attacked during the meeting in Bahir Dar had been discussing how to stop Asaminew's apparent recruitment of Amhara militias.

Shots were heard in the capital Addis Ababa, but aside from the military presence the mood is calm Will Abiy be strengthened or weakened? While Abiy and his government still have overall control over the country, the weekend's events have created a certain degree of uncertainty. Elections set for May 2020, would consolidate Abiy's power, as the prime minister was never formally elected but took over the government after his predecessor stepped down. Ludger Schadomsky, the head of DW's Amharic Service, said that he doubted that elections would take place next year. ""Even the test-run, a countrywide census, had to be called off. With that, Abiy will have failed to realize his pet project of receiving public approval of his reform course."" On the other hand, Schadomsky says, the crisis could also strengthen Abiy's position. He might, for instance, decide to surround himself with officials and military personnel who are loyal to him and therefore build up his hold on power. Weber believes that holding on to the election course is one of the only things that could stabilize the country. ""To postpone them would be sending out the wrong signal|"" she says. ""Everything would be open again, and there would be no effort put into acting as a unified political party, and the different nationalist and populist tendencies would quickly take hold."" Abiy should have done more to condemn the ethnic tensions within the countries, she adds. For that, however, Abiy would have had to condemn his supporters in the Oromo constituency, which he has so far failed to do. According to the United Nations, at least 2.4 million people have been displaced by the ethnic tension in Oromo, Amhara, and Tigray regions.

""Why study, if our future is being destroyed?"" This sign features a sentiment shared by increasing numbers of German students, who have joined young people worldwide in using Friday school strikes to call for action on climate change. The movement was inspired by 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who began her protests alone in front of the Swedish parliament in August 2018. With the 2015 Paris climate accord, nearly all of the world's countries committed to limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, preferably 1.5 degrees (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), by 2100. The hope is that this target will prevent the worst effects of climate disasters. Concerned by the dire predictions from climate scientists, more and more people have called for immediate action. Despite urgent warnings, politicians have dragged their heels on important climate decisions. It's become clear that Germany will miss its targets for 2020. Climate protection was an important factor in the European elections in late May, with the Greens winning more than 20% of the vote in Germany alone, more than double previous results. Among 18-24-year-olds, 34% backed the party. Germany's climate movement is fighting on many fronts. In recent years, activists have fought to preserve Hambach Forest in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, building treehouses to prevent the old-growth forest from being felled to make way for the mining of lignite, or brown coal. Energy giant RWE has launched legal action, and police have cleared the camp several times. In September 2018, a few days after the camp was removed again, a court ruling suspended the clearing of the forest until late 2020, after a lawsuit by environmental group BUND. RWE has argued that the forest has to be cut in order to ensure the coal necessary for Germany's electricity supply. Around 50,000 activists celebrated the victory. Protests organized by groups such as Ende Gelände have increasingly been making headlines. Thousands of young activists have come out to staged events, blocking railway tracks used to deliver coal to power plants near Cologne and occupying huge coal excavators, as seen here in the open-pit mine in the east German town of Welzow in 2016. In January 2019, after seven months of negotiations, a coal commission set up by the federal government to work out Germany's plans to phase out coal power released its findings. It recommended that Germany should continue coal mining until 2038, at the latest —far too late for the country to meet the targets of the 2015 Paris climate accord. An increasing number of young people in Germany are demanding that the government find a way to meet the 1.5-degree target. The emerging Fridays for Future movement has been getting support from longtime environmentalists, teachers, academics and parents. They have called for all German coal-fired power plants to be shut down by 2030, and for renewable energy initiatives to be vastly expanded.

""If we accept the burkini, in a few years, all the young girls from poor neighborhoods will be bathing covered up, for moral reasons or to protect their reputations|"" she told Radio Classique. Two of the women who took part in the protest held a very different view. Speaking to the BBC, Hassiba and Latifa said they should have the same rights as everyone else.

The Citizen Alliance said, via Facebook, that the action was part of a movement that began over a year ago with a petition signed by more than 600 Muslim women. They are pleading with Grenoble Mayor Eric Piolle to change the rules regarding public swimming pools. The 18th century saw the development of the first bathing outfits for ladies and whole-body suits for the gentlemen. People swam in bathing suits made of thick wool and cotton fabrics that soaked up lots of water and took an eternity to dry. Everything was strictly segregated according to gender - including swimming zones. When tourism started to take off in the early 20th century, swimming trips to the sea came into fashion. At the beginning of a season the sea was ""opened."" Swimsuits had by now become a little tighter, and elastic tricot came into play. Bathing caps, still resembling hats, were intended to protect people from the sun. Full-body swimsuits, as seen here in 1910, were designed for men and women. The Roaring Twenties finally catapulted swimwear into modernity: small belts, golden buttons and glittering sequins added a decidedly feminine touch to bathing fashion. During this period, swimsuits were tailored only in small fits - they were not available in plus sizes. Just four small triangles held together with thin strings, the world was shocked by the first bikini. On July 5, 1946, exotic dancer Micheline Bernardini appeared in front of cameras in a Parisian swimming pool in the skimpy piece of clothing. The suit was designed by French former-engineer Louis Réard, who probably had no idea he would change the way women bathed forever. In the 1950s in the US, Hollywood films featuring swimmers were very successful. The ""Aquamaids"" performed water ballet and gymnastics on water skis, as pictured in this photo. The top part of the bikini may seem as if it's in danger of flying off, while the skirt appears as if it won't go anywhere at 30 miles per hour. This is an early model of a sporty bikini style. Olympic swimmer Esther Williams caught the attention of Hollywood agents while performing in a water show. This enabled the athlete to earn an income, as she had not been able to participate in the Olympics in 1940 due to World War II. In ""Neptune's Daughter|"" she starred as an attractive bathing beauty, and would eventually become one of the richest women in Hollywood. The famous curves of American movie star Marilyn Monroe were much accentuated by a bathing suit - that is, when she actually wore one, rather than merely a few drops of Chanel No. 5. Her first successes in front of a camera were in the 1940s when she worked as a model for the famous Pirelli calendar (photo), well before her career as an actress took off. The beauty contests of the 1950s were quite modest. What counted most for the jury were inner values: Divorced women were not allowed to take part, for example. The appearances of the candidates were discreetly emphasized by high-heeled shoes and form-fitting swimsuits. Miss Germany Petra Schürmann (seventh from left, first row) won this Miss World competition in 1956. After Pop Art exploded on the scene, abstract and geometric patterns started to infiltrate fashion ateliers, and became a defining style of the 1960s. One of the most outstanding fashion designers was Frenchman Andre Courrèges, who applied constructivist patterns to swimwear. In the 1960s, an absolute must for women such as Italian actress Gina Lollobrigida, pictured here with co-star Sean Connery, was creative bathing caps in a flowery style. Water repellent rubber caps were a necessary accessory in every beach bag - and men were even permitted to wear a sporty version of them. The American TV series ""Baywatch"" has written swimwear history. The swimsuits of the Baywatch girls were extremely high cut, and defined beachwear fashion the world over in the early 90s. The bright red fabric was reduced even further for actress Pamela Anderson and her notable curves. The cult series was broadcast in 144 countries. When Ursula Andress emerged from the ocean in a tight two-piece in 1962, movie-goers' jaws dropped. James Bond, played by Sean Connery, also had to stop for a peek during the film ""Dr. No."" The same happens to Pierce Brosnan as James Bond in ""Die Another Day"" 40 years later. In this film, Halle Berry emerges from the water in a similarly flattering suit. The big question posed by all swimwear designers: How much material is too much? The difference between a bikini and a swimsuit, which traditionally is a little bit more concealing, is difficult to define. A swimsuit in retro style is presented here at Fashion Week Miami for the 2011 bathing season. When it comes to innovative swimwear, Australia is the leader. This photo was taken on the beach in Australia. In Australia and New Zealand, many people prefer not to be exposed to the blazing sun, and both Muslims and non-Muslims protect their skin from aggressive rays. On the French Riviera, on the other hand, burkinis are not tolerated. The same is true at many bathing establishments in Germany. The burkini ban remains highly controversial.

Nicholas Metaxas pleaded guilty to kidnapping charges as well as all seven premeditated murders, targeting several women who came to Cyprus looking for work. On Monday, the three-judge panel handed him seven life terms of 25 years each, with five of the terms running consecutively. Metaxas read out a handwritten statement apologizing to his victims, saying he could not explain why he carried out the killings. ""I acknowledge my guilt|"" he told the court. ""I apologize to the families of the victims and to the souls of the victims."" The trial marked the first time in Cyprus that a defendant has faced seven counts of premeditated murder, making him likely the first serial killer in the Mediterranean island's history. Several of the bodies were hidden in suitcases and thrown into lakes 'Campaign of murder' In reading out their decision, the judges said the defendant ""didn't even hesitate to kill children"" during a ""campaign of murder"" that lasted over two years.

Six of the victims were strangled to death, while the seventh sustained a massive head injury. The first body was uncovered in April by a German tourist who was taking pictures of a shaft at an abandoned ore mine. The body came to the surface of the 150-meter (500-foot) shaft following heavy rains. The discovery of the first body prompted a manhunt for Metaxas, who eventually led investigators to the locations of his other victims, including a toxic lake near the capital, Nicosia. Anger over 'negligence' by police The case sparked outrage in Cyprus as well as accusations of police racism, as it emerged that police had failed to follow up on reports that the women had gone missing. President Nicos Anastasiades criticized the police for ""apparent negligence and dereliction of duty|"" and said better investigations at the beginning could have saved lives.

He had announced that police officers and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) units would carry out the deportations. But, in typical unorthodox fashion, he took to Twitter on Saturday to call off the operation, praising Mexico for its work in stemming the tide of US-bound migrants. Trump also took aim at Democrats, urging them to cooperate on his proposed reform of US asylum policy. Otherwise, he said, the planned deportations would go ahead after all in two weeks' time. The land border crossing between the Mexican city of Tijuana and the US city of San Diego is the busiest in the Western Hemisphere. And, on the Mexican side, many are deeply concerned that Trump's threat to deport millions of people would precipitate a humanitarian crisis. Tijuana is already overwhelmed by the thousands of migrants from Central America waiting for their asylum applications to be processed. Overcrowded emergency shelters ""The situation along the border is chaotic, not just because of Trump's threats, but also because of Mexico's government|"" Valeria Griego of Tijuana's Casa del Migrante told DW. The institute provides emergency accommodation for migrants is the oldest such institute in the city. It was founded by the Congregation of the Missionaries of St. Charles Scalabrinians over 30 years ago. At the moment, the shelter is completely overcrowded. Griego said she had no idea how the Mexican government plans to deal with the situation. ""We have space for 150 people|"" Griego said. ""We reached our maximum capacity weeks ago, and now we only take in women and families, as well as men traveling with young children.""

She said that ""deporting just one person already entails immense effort."" First, an individual ""must be tracked down|"" and ""then a lot of paperwork is necessary after the arrest, which is followed by a court decision, and then the deportation itself."" On Friday, US media reported that President Trump had ordered raids in 10 major US cities by ICE officers to deport 2,000 families. Maureen Mayer of the human rights organization Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA) told DW: ""Arresting so many people in all these cities surpasses the abilities of ICE|"" adding that ""many of the children in these families have US citizenship."" Mayer said it was impossible to imagine what scenes would play out if parents were arrested while their children were in school, some even kindergarten. She said: ""Breaking up social groups like these and separating children from their families is generally frowned upon, especially because ICE officers are known to be uncompromising.""

""Several polls indicate that a majority of US citizens actually want to keep their country open to asylum-seekers|"" she said. Andrews says that footage of deportations could harm Trump's image. She explains that ""about 45% of those affected by deportations are men, and 90% of these have children who were born in the US and therefore have US citizenship."" She fears that the threat of deportation would provoke heartbreaking, and potentially dangerous situations, as ""these fathers would do anything, even risk their life, to stay with their children."" In a migrant shelter in the southern Mexican city of Tenosique, near the Guatemalan border, a refugee from Honduras says he originally planned to move to the United States with his family. Trump's election has changed everything. ""I wanted to go to the United States with my family, but we've seen that the new government there has made things harder."" Concepcion Bautista from Guatemala cradles her newborn son in the same migrant shelter. She says she plans to head for the United States, but will linger in Mexico to see how US President Donald Trump's immigration policies play out. Her goal is to reunite with her family up north... …but for the time being, she believes applying for asylum in Mexico is a smarter move. Mexican asylum data and testimony from migrants in Tenosique suggest that although fewer Central Americans are trying to enter the US, plenty are still fleeing their poor, violent home countries, with many deciding to stay longer in Mexico, which has traditionally been a transit country. The Trump administration has pointed out a sharp decline in immigrant detentions in the first few months of this year as a vindication for the president's tough immigration policies. The measures are already having another effect. In California, where farmers usually rely on workers from Mexico to bring in the harvest, many Mexicans are staying away, preferring to find work in their own country. Migrants from Central America play football in the migrant shelter in Tenosique. The number of people applying for asylum in Mexico has soared by more than 150 percent since Trump was elected president. These days, Mexican immigrants would rather set up in Canada than the United States. One man from Guatemala says the prices charged by people smugglers have risen sharply since Trump took office, now hovering around $10,000 (9,100 euros), up from about $6,000 a few years ago. Migrants sit below a mural in Mexico with the words: ""Our demand is minimal: justice."" With Mexico's immigration authorities controlling migration more assiduously, Central Americans were forced to take more isolated, dangerous routes where the chances of being mugged were higher. ""We've gone north several times, but every time it's got harder|"" says one man, who was deported from the United States in December. ""Now, it's better if we travel alone, along new routes.""

"a-46602157"|"https://www.dw.com/en/italian-mafia-bikers-berlin-clans-europes-crime-gangs/a-46602157"|"Ben Knight"|"According to the European Union, there are about 5,000 organized crime networks operating in all 28 member countries — and they have a significant effect on the bloc's economy. A 2016 report published by the Italy-based Joint Research Centre on Transnational Crime, or Transcrime, found that illicit markets generate about €110 billion ($125 billion) a year, amounting to 1 percent of the European Union's gross domestic product. The largest portion of this revenue (€28 billion a year) comes from the drug trade, though tax fraud — specifically VAT fraud — is becoming a growing a source of income, Transcrime reported. Other major activities include human trafficking (for sex work and other labor exploitation), counterfeiting, and illicit tobacco and weapons trading. Much of this money is laundered through legitimate businesses, particularly in southern Italy, where organized crime has its deepest roots, and key EU ports and border regions. Italian Mafia The three biggest Italian Mafia networks are the 'ndrangheta, based in the state of Calabria; theCamorra,from Campania; and the Cosa Nostra,of Sicily. The 'ndrangheta, one of the richest and most powerful criminal organizations in the world, was the focus of several raids in Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and Belgium on December 5. It is know to be active in both North and South America as well. Each of the networks encompasses several families who control vast assets: In 2007, Italian organized crime agencies estimated that the 'ndrangheta alone pulled in revenues of €35-€40 billion, though much of this came through investments in legal businesses, including construction and restaurants. Mafia are thought to have strong influence in regional governments in Italy. Prosecution has often proved difficult because of the families' influence in local courts, and the fact that top judges often avoid working in Mafia-controlled areas. <div class=""opinary-widget-embed"" data-poll=""do-you-think-organized-crime-is-a-proble"" data-customer=""deutschewelleeng""></div> <script async type=""text/javascript"" src=""//widgets.opinary.com/embed.js""></script> Turkish groups Networks based in Turkey are active across Europe, especially in countries like with large diaspora populations such as Germany, the Netherlands and the UK. They are heavily involved in drug trafficking, especially heroin, an interest that connects many to Bulgarian crime networks. Other businesses include illegal gambling, prostitution, human trafficking and extortion. A major Turkish-Cypriot crime family is the Arifs, who moved into London's underworld following the fall of gangs such as the Firm, run by the Kray twins, in the 1960s. Clans in Germany Several organizations have emerged from Arab communities within Germany, some including refugees from Palestine and the war in Lebanon in the 1980s. The most well-known families, mainly based in Berlin, Bremen, North Rhine-Westphalia, and Lower Saxony, are named Abou-Chaker, Al-Zein, Remmo, and Miri. Police say there are about 50 active families across the country. The groups, often called clans, are believed to have several thousand members each, and the main activities include drug dealing, prostitution, protection money and robberies — often spectacular, as the theft of a large Canadian gold coin from a museum made clear. A recent clan-related killing in Berlin attracted much attention in the German media. Some clans have connections in show business.

There are thought to be 15 families in Albania alone, with more in diaspora communities. The Albanian groups are considered highly ""traditional|"" with a strong reliance on family, honor and loyalty. They often are made up of thousands of members spread around the world. Russian networks Groups that originate in Russia are said to often be much more decentralized than others. The networks have a major role in the trafficking of heroin from Afghanistan. An estimated 12 percent of the world's heroin goes to Russia. Only one such Russian organization is said to the active in Germany: the Samarovskaya Gruppa, which operates mainly in Berlin and Cologne and is said to be organized into cells, much like a terror organization. The suspected head, Leonid Zamarov, was arrested in Berlin in 2013. During the raids, German anti-terror units found assault rifles, grenades, handguns and even a Claymore mine. Hells Angels, Bandidos Biker, or ""rocker|"" organizations such as the Hells Angels have been active in Germany since at least the 1970s. Though they do not officially consider themselves criminal organizations, many members are known to be involved in pimping and dealing in weapons and drugs.

In particular, as the remains of almost 12,000 people who drowned in the Mediterranean since 2014 have not been recovered or identified. Some 337 children died while migrating in Africa, although figures in that region are even harder to come by. The highest number of deaths, 144, occurred in North Africa, presumably on their way to Europe. Some 30 million children worldwide are currently living outside their country of birth Testimonies of migrants collected through surveys for the report suggested that children die crossing lakes and rivers, as well as traveling on land routes on foot or in overloaded vehicles. Aside from the North Africa destination, migrants also head eastward to the Gulf countries or towards Southern Africa. Southeast Asia has the next deadliest region in the world for migrating children. It is estimated that 363 children have died or have gone missing since 2014, with more than 70 per cent of the deaths taking place in the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea. Land routes to Europe are less dangerous for children. Nonetheless, some 40 children died while travelling by foot, bus, truck or train across Europe from 2014 to 2018. Vehicle or train-related incidents were the most recorded cause of death.

More than 12 million of them are refugees and approximately 1 million children are asylum-seeking children.

""I have decided to enter the port of Lampedusa. I know what I'm risking, but the 42 rescued people are exhausted. I'm taking them to safety now|"" the captain said on Wednesday. On Saturday, she was taken into custody by Italian authorities, the ship was impounded and the 40 remaining asylum-seekers on the boat were allowed to disembark. Rackete faces prosecution for sailing into Italian waters despite a ban from Rome. Sea-Watch 3 had been in the Mediterranean Sea with the asylum-seekers on board for over two weeks before Rackete made the decision that could land her with a fine of up to €50,000 ($56,000) as well as criminal charges under a new law prohibiting aiding and abetting illegal immigration. Police put Rackete under house arrest on Saturday ""Mission accomplished|"" tweeted Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini from the far-right League Party, posting ""criminal captain arrested, the pirate ship seized, the maximum sentence for a foreign non-governmental organization."" According to Rackete, the desperation of those on board was enormous and what ultimately convinced her to enter the Lampedusa port. She said some on board were considering jumping off the ship. Several migrants were brought ashore in a state of ""medical emergency."" Before being taken into custody, she said she was driven to take action on her own because there were no other options left. In an interview with jetzt, the online youth magazine of newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, she said her efforts to find a political solution with the European Union and Italian officials failed. 'I feel a moral obligation' Who is this 31-year-old woman was willing to go into David vs. Goliath battle with the Italian government? Rackete has captained the Sea-Watch 3 since 2018 and has worked for the organization for four years. The skipper trained as a nautical officer and completed a Master's degree in Conservation Management at Edge Hill University in Ormskirk, England. She has also worked for the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research and was active in Greenpeace. Rackete has commanded a handful of Sea-Watch rescues, picking up 45 bodies floating in the sea from a shipwreck in one of her first missions. The media's image of Rackete is not that of a person who wants to be seen as just a personal antagonist of Salvini: ""His opponent here is civil society as a whole|"" she told the dpa news agency. She also said she believes deeply in the ""principle of human rights|"" and that she was responsible for the rescue. She told the Italian daily la Repubblica that those on board ""could not endure it any longer. Their lives come before any political game."" Rackete's conviction to help people in need is, in her own words, also related the comparatively privileged life she has lived.

The SPA and the military have clashed repeatedly in recent weeks, disagreeing over the timeline for a transition to democracy after the protest movement ousted former strongman President Omar al-Bashir. Since talks between the two groups broke down earlier this month, a violent crackdown has killed at least 128 people across the country, according to protest organizers. Demonstrators have repeatedly accused the military of trying to make a power grab in Bashir's absence. ""This represents a violation of liberties that is even worse than the regime of the former president|"" SPA spokesman Ahmed al-Rabie told Reuters news agency after the raid on their offices. ""This is a bad sign for the atmosphere of mediation between the two parties."" For weeks - even during Ramadan - thousands of protesters camped outside Sudan's defense ministry, demanding a transitional council in which civilians could decide the future of the country. In early June the military moved in and forcefully removed the protesters. Dozens of people died and those who survived reported rapes, sexual abuse, and the use of force. A protester holds up the national flag outside the army headquarters. His demand: that Sudan's Transitional Military Council hand over power to the civilians. This, the protesters believe, will be an important step towards democracy. In early June, just days ahead of the crackdown on the sit-in, the military increased its presence on the streets. Many protesters predicted that the army would not want to hand over power. This was what they hoped for after the ousting of longtime president Omar al-Bashir. From 1989 until his April 2019, Omar al-Bashir ruled Sudan. He suppressed critics. In 1999 he even dismantled parliament in order to maintain his grip on power. His name will, however, be remembered for his handling of the Darfur crisis. His troops' harsh response led to thousands of deaths, and for that, he is wanted for crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court. Many Sudanese had been waiting for this day for a long time - the day when Omar al-Bashir would have to face a court. On June 16, he appeared before prosecutors, accused of corruption and the illegal possession of foreign currency. After being ousted, security forces found over one million US dollars stashed away in his villa. Many women actively participated in the protests, and they gave the protests a different face. Their presence underlined the protesters demand for democracy and equal rights. During the brutal crackdown by security forces, many women reported sexual abuse and rape as a means to silence them. Architecture student Alaa Salah became the face of the revolution. A photographer shot this picture as she stood on top of a car and addressed protesters. Photos and videos of her protest chants trended on social media. Online she is known as ""Kandaka"" or the Nubian queen. Thanks to social media, the protests rapidly caught international attention and support from human rights groups and Sudanese living abroad. In a statement, the EU's foreign ministers urged for an immediate end to all forms of violence against Sudanese civilians. But not all Sudanese civilians are against the army. Some people, in fact, want a tough military rule to give the country security and strength. The army supporters have placed their faith in General Abdel Fattah Burhan, the head of the Transitional Military Council. The real power, however, lies not with General Abdel Fattah Burhan, but his deputy, General Mohammed Hamdan Daglu, also known as ""Hemeti."" He heads the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) who cracked down brutally on the protesters. During the war in Darfur, he commanded the feared Janjaweed militias. The protesters fear that he could, in the end, take power. Politicians of other Arab nations have been watching the developments in Sudan with a certain degree of concern. Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, it is believed, fears that successful grassroots protests could set an example for citizens in the Arab Peninsula. Both the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia appear to be supporting the military regime. Cairo seems similarly concerned about the events in Khartoum. Egyptian president Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi (pictured l. with Omar al-Bashir in 2018) fears that the Muslim Brotherhood, which Eygpt has been trying to silence, could fall on fertile ground in Sudan. If the Muslim Brotherhood gains support in Sudan, al-Sisi believes that its success might strengthen the group again in Egypt. In Sudan, the protests continue unabated. Military leaders on Monday, June 23, turned down a proposal for a power-sharing deal. The protest leaders, represented by the coalition Forces for Declaration of Freedom and Change, which includes the Sudanese Professional's Association, had accepted the deal which was negotiated with the help of Ethiopia. Author: Kersten Knipp Military warns potential 'vandals' The umbrella organization Forces for Freedom and Change (FFC), to which SPA belongs, said that a protest planned for Sunday would still go ahead, even after they were compelled to cancel their press conference. Ahead of the marches set to take place in cities and town across the nation, the military warned that protest leaders would be punished over any ""vandals"" who caused property damage or blocked roads on Sunday. Organizers took this as a veiled threat against the protestors as a whole. The military, however, has said that it does not oppose the marches. After weeks of sit-ins outside military headquarters and repeated attempts to broker dialogue, it seemed on Saturday as if the army had accepted a proposal made by neighboring Ethiopia and the African Union, which the opposition had already tacitly agreed to. es/bw (Reuters, AP) Every evening, DW sends out a selection of the day's news and features.

Philip Alston, UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty, said the Trump administration appears determined to pull the social safety net out from under millions of poor people while rewarding the wealthy with tax cuts. In his report, Alston called on the US to address the underlying problems facing the underclass rather than ""punishing and imprisoning the poor."" Send Facebook Twitter google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/2skMu He noted that welfare benefits are being slashed and access to health care has become more difficult during Trump's presidency. This, in conjunction with ""financial windfalls"" for the super rich and big corporations, has accelerated inequality. Since President Lyndon Johnson's war on poverty in the 1960s US social policy towards the poor has been ""neglectful at best|"" Alston said. ""But the policies pursued over the past year seem deliberately designed to remove basic protections from the poorest, punish those who are not in employment and make even basic health care into a privilege to be earned rather than a right of citizenship|"" he said. In a country of about 325 million people, nearly 41 million live in poverty — including 18.5 million in extreme poverty. Alston said children accounted for 33 percent of the poor. No other industrialized country had so many children mired in poverty, he said. Poverty and unemployment The data used to compile the UN report only covers the period through 2016, so there are no comparative figures that could measure poverty levels before and after Trump took office in January 2017. Alston, a veteran UN rights expert and New York University law professor, will present his report to the UN Human Rights Council later this month. His report is a compilation of data in conjunction with his travels to various part of America, including rural Alabama, a Los Angeles slum, and the US territory of Puerto Rico. Alston cited ""shameful statistics"" linked to entrenched racial discrimination. He said African Americans are 2.5 times more likely than whites to live in poverty and their unemployment rate is more than twice as high.

Since assuming office, Salvini has sought to put a stop to migrant rescue ships docking on Italian shores and disembarking refugees.

But as Tony Platt opens the door, the smell of unattended litter trays overwhelms the corridors. In the dimly lit room, sit two beds, a table, and half a dozen cats. Tony hands out £4.20 (€4.70/$5.30) to Imran Hameed, the founder of Salma Food Bank: it's the bus fare that Hameed lent Tony earlier in the week when he dropped off food at their home. ""My dad was a desert rat. He taught me the meaning of loyalty. He fought from Alexandria all the way to Tobruk in WWII|"" says Tony, in his early 50s, who was working as a landscape gardener, until last year when he suffered a heart attack. Tony's appearance is that of a gentleman in castoffs. He is disheveled and unassuming, but rich in stories and values, with a dry sense of humor. Without any savings, the unexpected heart attack meant he had to fall back on Universal Credit — a Tory welfare construct, and a circuitous, hard to navigate social support system that leaves him short for a week at the end of every month. Apart from the monthly £190 the Platts receive from the Department of Social Security, there is little else. ""It's gone in a day, we have the shopping to do|"" he says. ""I am from the North you see, Rochdale. We had a policy in the North of England, if you ain't got it, you do without."" Before finding Salma Food Bank, it was not unusual for Tony to go to bed hungry. ""It's these guys I care about|"" he says, pointing to his wife and cats.

There is no respite from the illnesses she's suffered in recent years: epilepsy, diabetes, high blood pressure, making her reliant on severe medication. ""When there is no food the diabetes can be life threatening|"" she says. Just one example of many Since Imran Hameed launched Salma Food Bank in the West Midlands three years ago in his mother's honor, he has been astonished by the levels of invisible poverty. ""Poverty for me was either India or Pakistan. It was absolutely mental when we started doing this. It is right here on our doorstep."" Between April 2018 and May 2019, nearly 1.6 million three-day emergency food supplies were given to people in crisis by Trussell Trust food banks, a 19% increase from the previous year. More than half a million of these parcels went to children. With welfare spending for UK's poorest cut by £37 billion, religious charities are stepping in. Last month, the UN's special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston, likened the government's welfare politics to a ""sanitized"" version of Victorian-era workhouses. Matt Adcock of the Church Urban Fund admits that the poverty crisis has worsened, but there is some good that has emerged from it. ""What is most inspiring about the growing number of initiatives like 'Feeding Bradford' is to see churches, mosques and social support groups working together to face the growing demand for food banks and support services|"" he said A primary driver behind the increased food bank use is the Universal Credit system [a social security system which merged several payments into one with the aim of simplifying the system — the ed.], which former Labour leader Gordon Brown denounced as ""cruel and vindictive.""

Hameed says he was astounded at the level of ""invisible"" poverty in the West Midlands ""In the West Midlands, Salma Food Bank is the only emergency food bank that delivers to your doorstep in an emergency|"" says Hameed. Still, the challenges to access welfare support are plenty. Desperate mothers fleeing domestic violence suffer from language barriers; some don't have access to the internet and have to travel miles before they find their nearest job center. ""What is even more infuriating for a single mother is they require a voucher|"" says Hameed. 30% of his beneficiaries are infants and toddlers. Keep the faith Currently there are around 8,000 churches involved in either running or supporting food banks. In many areas, the UK faith based groups have become the last beacon of hope for many who are just about surviving. ""These groups are easily accessible unlike government schemes which can be a complicated process|"" says Ravinder Singh, founder of the Sikh-run Khalsa Aid. Sasha Newbury turned to the Salma Food Bank to help her and her kids out of a precarious situation When Sasha Newbury*, in her early 30s, and her four young kids were threatened with a knife by her abusive husband in Dudley, the police asked Hameed for help. Quick to sense her desperation, Hameed gathered all the kids into his van with their belongings and put them in one of his own properties while they waited for support from the social services. Newbury was only a year into her marriage before cracks began to appear. ""I had no food, and I was struggling. And I needed help. I have no family, just a few friends. This was my last resort|"" she said from her four bedroom council house in Handsworth in the West Midlands. Newbury had phoned the council previously and was denied help. Now in the midst of a divorce from her former Albanian partner and with two kids who suffer from cerebral palsy and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, her fight is far from over. Whilst loading food parcels into his van to deliver to his next client, Hameed isn't showing any signs of slowing down.

Putin was commenting on his meeting with US President Donald Trump the day before, most of which happened behind closed doors. ""We have tasked our respective foreign minister to start lower-level talks on [nuclear disarmament]|"" Putin said. The talks, according to Putin's comments carried by the Russian Interfax news agency, would be related to extending the New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) which went into force in 2011 after talks between Trump's predecessor Barack Obama and Russia's then-president Dmitry Medvedev. Fears of restarting nuclear race The New START limits the number of deployed nuclear warheads, which are ready to use on intercontinental missiles and heavy bomber bases, to 1,550. The treaty also imposes various other restrictions to US and Russia's nuclear capabilities. It is set to expire in 2021. According to 2019 data provided by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, both the US and Russia currently have about 1,600 deployed strategic nuclear heads at their disposal. Russia has a total of 6,500 nuclear warheads, compared to 6,185 on the US side. Russia's Putin has repeatedly warned that New START expiry date could signal a new nuclear arms race. IMF on the brink On Saturday, he refused to give a timeline for the talks and said it was ""too early to talk about"" the likelihood of getting to an agreement.

On Friday May 10, 2019 President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on $200 billion (€178 billion) worth of Chinese goods. The move rasied tariffs from 10% to 25% on a range of consumer products, including cell phone, computers and toys. China's Commerce Ministry said it ""deeply regrets"" the US decision. In April 2019, the United States said it wanted to put tariffs on $11.2 billion worth of goods from the EU. The list includes helicopters and aircraft from Airbus as well as European exports like: famous cheeses like Stilton, Roquefort and Gouda, wines and oysters, ceramics, knives and pajamas. The EU imposed import duties of 25% on a $2.8 billion range of imports from the United States in retaliation for US tariffs on European steel and aluminum. Targeted US products include Harley-Davidson motorcycles, bourbon, peanuts, blue jeans, steel and aluminum. May 17, 2019 is the deadline for President Trump to decide on imposing tariffs on vehicle imports from the EU. According to diplomats, Germany, whose exports of cars and parts to the United States are more than half the EU total, wants to press ahead with talks to ward off tariffs on automakers Volkswagen, Mercedes and BMW. India, the world's biggest buyer of US almonds, on June 21, 2018 raised import duties on the nuts by 20% and increased tariffs on a range of other farm products and US iron and steel, in retaliation for US tariffs on Indian steel. Trump said last month that he would end preferential trade treatment for India, which would result in US tariffs on up to $5.6 billion of imports from India. Mexico on June 5, 2018 imposed tariffs of up to 25% on American steel, pork, cheese, apples, potatoes and bourbon, in retaliation for US tariffs on Mexican metals. While to the north, Canada on July 1 imposed tariffs on $12.6 billion worth of U.S. goods, including steel, aluminum, coffee, ketchup and bourbon whiskey in retaliation for US tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum. Trump and Xi to discuss Huawei The dispute has already disrupted global supply chains and markets. Talks between US and Chinese officials over the tit-for-tat measures collapsed last month after 11 rounds of negotiations. The trade dispute between China and the US includes a feud over Chinese technology firm Huawei, with Beijing fearing it could threaten the company's global growth. The Trump administration has declared Huawei a security threat, effectively banning US companies from doing business with it. The US has encouraged its allies to shun the firm in their 5G networks on security grounds, and has also suggested it could be a factor in a trade deal. Trump said on Saturday that he had discussed Huawei with Xi and that resolving the issue would come later. US companies would still be able to sell components to Huawei, he added.

In 2018, she was granted bail and allowed to leave Evin prison in Tehran for three days, under the condition that she not speak to the media. In 2017, then British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson was forced to apologize after he incorrectly said that Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been in Iran training journalists at the time she was arrested.

Trump is the first sitting US president to visit the DMZ. ""I feel great. It is an honor to be here|"" Trump told reporters after he briefly crossed into North Korea. ""I was proud to step over the line|"" he told Kim. He also said he would invite Kim to the White House, as he hailed his ""great friendship"" with Kim. Kim said that his ""wonderful"" relationship with Trump would enable North Korea and the US to get over obstructions to their stalled nuclear talks. ""I am convinced our relationship will enable us to overcome barriers standing in the way|"" said Kim, adding that his close ties with the US leader made the DMZ meeting possible ""just overnight."" North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump shake hands as they meet for the first time. Unlike in past meetings with some world leaders, Trump did not try to pull Kim's hand towards him or hold on to the North Korean leader's hand too long. Trump and Kim appeared at ease with one another during the summit. Just a few months prior, Trump and Kim engaged in a war of words, trading insults like ""little rocket man"" and ""mentally deranged."" Following their meeting, Trump said he formed a ""special bond"" with Kim and that he'd like to invite him to the White House. Kim lays a hand on Trump's back as they leave after signing a joint statement pledging peace negotiations and denuclearization. Some critics worried that the US agreed to give up too many things in negotiations with Kim. At a press conference, Trump said he wanted to stop US military exercises with South Korea and eventually withdraw US troops — something Pyongyang has been demanding for years. Trump displays the joint agreement he signed with Kim. In the four-point document, Kim agreed to the ""complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."" In exchange, Trump agreed to provide ""security guarantees"" to Pyongyang. The two leaders also agreed to build a ""robust peace regime"" and to return the remains of prisoners of the 1950-1953 Korean War. South Koreans watch the summit on a screen located at a train station in Seoul. Ahead of the event, critics expressed concern that the meeting between the two leaders would be purely symbolic and not bring concrete progress to easing tensions. Indeed, the agreement did not specify what exact measures would be taken. A bartender in Singapore crafted a special drink for the summit, dubbed ""The Bromance."" The meeting was held on Singapore's Sentosa island, a resort area with luxury hotels and a theme park. The island's security was massively increased ahead of the summit, while local businesses marked the occasion with special Trump-Kim branded water and drinks. Author: Rebecca Staudenmaier (with dpa, AFP) 'Handshake for peace' Trump, who is on a visit to South Korea, earlier confirmed that he would meet Kim at the DMZ that separates the Korean Peninsula. South Korean President Moon Jae-in had said earlier on Sunday that Kim and Trump ""will have a handshake for peace standing at Panmunjom, the symbol of division|"" referring to the ""truce village"" in the DMZ. The DMZ has layers of barbed wire, mines and other security measures, as the two Koreas are still technically at war.

Experts have warned that North Korea may never agree to fully give up its nuclear ambitions, which they say Pyongyang views as vital for regime survival.

Although his previous two meetings with the North Korean leader didn't yield any result, Trump said he was ""in no rush"" to defuse tensions on the Korean Peninsula. Read more: North Korea's Kim Jong Un open to third Trump summit  In early June 2017, North Korea test-launched an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) for the first time. Testing an ICBM marked a major military achievement for Pyongyang and a serious escalation of tensions with the United States and its allies in the region, particularly South Korea and Japan. At the time, defense experts said the ICBM could reach as far as the US states of Alaska and Hawaii. However, it was unclear if North Korea can field an ICBM capable of carrying a nuclear warhead on its cone that could survive reentry into the Earth's atmosphere. North Korean state media claimed the ICBM was capable of carrying a ""large, heavy nuclear warhead"" to any part of the United States. The ICBM is believed to be a step forward in the North's nuclear program. Despite pressure from the international community, Pyongyang has made no secret of its nuclear ambitions. Alongside its ritual ballistic missile tests, North Korea has conducted nuclear tests on at least six occasions, including one in September 2017. Responding to the first ICBM test with a show of force, the US and South Korean troops on conducted ""deep strike"" precision missile drills using Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) and the Republic of Korea's Hyunmoo Missile II. In April, the US sent its Carl Vinson aircraft carrier towards the Korean Peninsula, saying it was taking prudent measures against the North. Ignoring international condemnation, Pyongyang test-launched another rocket on July 28, 2017, just weeks after its first ICBM test. In both of the tests, North Korea used Hwasong-14 missile, but the second one reached a higher altitude and traveled a larger distance than the first one, according to the state media. Pyongyang conducted its third test November 29, using a newly developed Hwasong-15 missile. US, Japanese and South Korean officials said it rose to about 4,500 km (2,800 miles) and flew 960 kilometers (600 miles) over about 50 minutes before landing in Japan's exclusive economic zone off the country's coast. Apart from a developing missile and nuclear program, North Korea has a powerful army with 700,000 active troops and another 4.5 million in the reserves. It can call upon almost a quarter of its population to serve in the army at any given time. The North's bloated army is believed to outnumber its southern neighbor's by two-to-one. According to the 2017 Global Firepower Index, the North has, as part of a far-reaching arsenal, 458 fighter aircraft, 5,025 combat tanks, 76 submarines, and 5,200,000 total military personnel. The picture above from 2013 shows leader Kim Jong Un ordering strategic rocket forces to be on standby to strike US and South Korean targets at any time. Alongside the United States, Pyongyang views its neighbors South Korea and Japan as its two other main enemies. North Korea has used US military exercises in the region as means of galvanizing its people, claiming that the exercises are dress rehearsals for an impending invasion. Every year, hundreds of thousands of soldiers and citizens roll through the streets of the capital Pyongyang to take part in the North's military parades. Preparations for the rallies often begin months in advance, and the parades usually mark important anniversaries linked with the Communist Party or Kim Jong Un's family. shs/ng (Reuters, AFP, AP, dpa) Every evening, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.

But the opposition leader has downplayed the possibility of a quick resolution and has not backed down from his main demand that early presidential elections take place, something that Maduro has fiercely rejected. Guaido's momentum has stalled since he staged a failed attempt at a military uprising in April. Since January, when he declared himself interim president and led a new wave of protests against the government, most of the armed forces' top command has stood firmly by Maduro. Venezuela's political stalemate is taking place in the midst of a deep economic crisis that has forced some 10% of its population to flee the country.

Television footage showed a heavy security presence at the port and police escorting 31-year-old Rackete off the vessel. Italy had refused the German rescue ship port entry since it picked up 53 migrants who were floating on an inflatable raft off the Libyan coast on June 12. After waiting at sea for an invitation from Italy or an EU state to accept the ship, Rackete decided to head to Lampedusa, where she was blocked by Italian government vessels. ""Even though in the afternoon the prosecution has opened an investigation against me, at the same time they notified us that they will not help to bring the rescued off the ship|"" Rackete said in a video statement on Twitter.

The boats would also have to go via the Atlantic Ocean and through the Gulf of Biscay where the sea is much rougher than in the Mediterranean. ""We cannot impose this rough journey on weakened people which we have rescued from the sea|"" a Sea-Watch spokesperson said. ""Secondly, we don't want to send our ship on a 5-week journey to Hamburg when it is desperately needed back in the SAR zone.""

Member states and MEPs have been deadlocked over deciding who should fill the positions after May's elections, in which major parties saw their power shrink, and populists and Greens made huge gains. The leaders will nominate the successor to European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, along with names to fill top diplomat posts, including heads of the European Parliament, European Council and European Central Bank. Arriving at the extraordinary summit in Brussels, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that negotiations to choose a new president ""will not be very easy."" Read more: Merkel's pick to head European Commission Send Facebook Twitter google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/3JGak The candidates The next commission president will likely be nominated from a list put forward by the European Parliament, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Saturday. She said conservative MEP Manfred Weber and his Social Democrat rival, Frans Timmermans were ""definitely"" part of the solution in the deadlocked debate. Manfred Weber: Favorite to replace Juncker is German EU lawmaker Manfred Weber, whose center-right European People's Party (EPP) is the largest grouping in the European Parliament. However, the EPP lost seats in last month's European elections, making it more difficult to form a majority in parliament that would be in favor of the Bavarian. Frans Timmermans: Also in the running is Weber's center-left rival from the Netherlands, Frans Timmermans of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists & Democrats (S&D). Timmermans promises to bring the bloc closer to ordinary voters at a time when Britain's looming exit is just one — albeit dominant — example of several nationalist movements across the EU. Margrethe Vestager: EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager of the liberal alliance, which came third in the May elections, is also tipped to be seriously considered for the Commission's top job. The Danish MEP has taken on corporations like Apple, Amazon and Google parent Alphabet. It's also been said that she served as the inspiration for the main character in Borgen, a Danish series where a woman becomes Denmark's first female leader. Others in the running: Another possibility is French MEP and EU Chief Brexit Negotiator Michel Barnier (EPP). Others include Belgium's liberal Prime Minister Charles Michel, Bulgarian World Bank head Kristalina Georgieva, and outgoing Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite. Next steps: Candidates can only be approved if they have the support of at least 21 of the 28 EU leaders, as well as backing from a majority in the new 751-seat European Parliament. The new officials will set EU policy for the next five years. Read more: Weber aims to lead European Commission The center-right European People's Party (EPP) — the largest faction in the European Parliament — has picked Manfred Weber, its German parliamentary party leader. He has the backing of Chancellor Angela Merkel. Though considered the front-runner, Weber is little known on the international stage, and his language skills are considered poor. Frans Timmermans, the European Commission's first vice president, will lead the campaign for the Progressive Alliance of Socialists & Democrats (S&D). Weber's main rival promises to bring the bloc closer to ordinary voters at a time when Britain's looming exit is one factor behind the nationalist movements across the EU. Margrethe Vestager, 51, is one of seven lead candidates for the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats. As the current EU commissioner for competition, the Danish MEP has taken on corporations like Apple, Amazon and Google parent Alphabet. It's also been said that she served as the inspiration for the main character in Borgen, a Danish series where a woman becomes Denmark's first female leader. The third-largest group in the EU Parliament, the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR), has just one candidate: Jan Zahradil, chairman of the Czech ECR delegation. Zahradil, 65, is affectionately known as ""Forrest Gump"" for cycling from Prague to Strasbourg for a session of the European Parliament and for once running 1,300 kilometers (about 800 miles) across the Czech Republic for charity. The Greens/EFA is the seventh largest group in European Parliament, so the German is a long shot to become European Commission president. The Greens have proposed a job share, with two candidates serving for two-and-a-half years each. The most favorite to join Keller is Dutch lawmaker Bas Eickhout. The EU's left-wing groups will be headed by Spanish trade unionist Nico Cue and Violeta Tomic (at left). Tomic is a deputy in Slovenia's National Assembly, best known as a TV presenter and actress. She entered into politics in 2014 and has been an advocate for LGBT rights and stronger citizens' rights in Europe. Cue grew up in Belgium after his family was forced to flee Franco's Soain. Author: Keith Walker Why the deadlock? After weeks of talks, the four dominant groups in the new European Parliament — the conservatives, socialists, liberals and the greens — haven't been able to agree on a compromise candidate to replace Juncker. The EPP says its candidate, Weber, has the strongest claim. But while he has been backed by Merkel, critics cite his lack of experience leading a government. French President Emmanuel Macron and others, including Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, are opposed to him. EU Council President Donald Tusk met early Sunday with top parliament officials and Sanchez, many hours before the summit was to kick off. Leaders were hoping to firm up the list of candidates over dinner from 6 p.m. (4 p.m. UTC).

General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, the head of paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), said several of his paramilitaries have already been targeted. ""There are snipers who are firing on people, they shot three members of the Rapid Support Force and five or six citizens|"" said Dagalo, who is also deputy chief of the ruling military council. ""There are infiltrators, people who want to jeopardize progress|"" he said in televised remarks, pledging to bring the offenders to justice. Dagalo did not say if anyone was killed in the attack. It was not immediately possible to confirm his claims. 'Massive deployment' of security forces Fear of violence ran high in Sudanese capital Khartoum, where thousands of protesters were marching towards the country's defense ministry, on nearly three months after the military ousted President Omar al-Bashir. The ""million-man"" march — a protest against Sudan's ruling generals — is seen as a test for protest organizers who said that security forces used live rounds to disperse a sit-in on June 3. Sudanese people are out in big numbers on the streets of Khartoum, Omdurman and Bahri. Sudanese journalist Alsanosi Adam told DW. ""There is a massive deployment of police officers, paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and security forces."" Earlier, police fired tear gas at protesters as crowds gathered for the rally, according to witnesses cited by the Agence France-Presse news agency. Reuters reported security forces ""firing shots in the air."" 'Power grab' Security forces raided the offices of one of Sudan's main opposition groups, the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), the group said late on Saturday, forcing it to nix a press conference ahead of major protests. The SPA and the military have clashed repeatedly in recent weeks, disagreeing over the timeline for a transition to democracy after the protest movement ousted former strongman President Omar al-Bashir. Since talks between the two groups broke down earlier this month, a violent crackdown has killed at least 128 people across the country, according to protest organizers. Demonstrators have repeatedly accused the military of attempting a power grab. ""This represents a violation of liberties that is even worse than the regime of the former president|"" SPA spokesman Ahmed al-Rabie told Reuters news agency after the raid on its offices. ""This is a bad sign for the atmosphere of mediation between the two parties."" Military warns potential 'vandals' The umbrella organization Forces for Freedom and Change (FFC), to which SPA belongs, said that a protest planned for Sunday would still go ahead, even after they were compelled to cancel their press conference. Ahead of the marches in cities and towns across the nation, the military warned that protest leaders would be punished over any ""vandals"" who caused property damage or blocked roads on Sunday. Organizers took this as a veiled threat against the protesters as a whole. The military, however, has said that it does not oppose the marches. After weeks of sit-ins outside military headquarters and repeated attempts to broker dialogue, it seemed on Saturday as if the army had accepted a proposal made by neighboring Ethiopia and the African Union, which the opposition had already tacitly agreed to. Read more: Sudan protesters suspend talks with military leadership For weeks - even during Ramadan - thousands of protesters camped outside Sudan's defense ministry, demanding a transitional council in which civilians could decide the future of the country. In early June the military moved in and forcefully removed the protesters. Dozens of people died and those who survived reported rapes, sexual abuse, and the use of force. A protester holds up the national flag outside the army headquarters. His demand: that Sudan's Transitional Military Council hand over power to the civilians. This, the protesters believe, will be an important step towards democracy. In early June, just days ahead of the crackdown on the sit-in, the military increased its presence on the streets. Many protesters predicted that the army would not want to hand over power. This was what they hoped for after the ousting of longtime president Omar al-Bashir. From 1989 until his April 2019, Omar al-Bashir ruled Sudan. He suppressed critics. In 1999 he even dismantled parliament in order to maintain his grip on power. His name will, however, be remembered for his handling of the Darfur crisis. His troops' harsh response led to thousands of deaths, and for that, he is wanted for crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court. Many Sudanese had been waiting for this day for a long time - the day when Omar al-Bashir would have to face a court. On June 16, he appeared before prosecutors, accused of corruption and the illegal possession of foreign currency. After being ousted, security forces found over one million US dollars stashed away in his villa. Many women actively participated in the protests, and they gave the protests a different face. Their presence underlined the protesters demand for democracy and equal rights. During the brutal crackdown by security forces, many women reported sexual abuse and rape as a means to silence them. Architecture student Alaa Salah became the face of the revolution. A photographer shot this picture as she stood on top of a car and addressed protesters. Photos and videos of her protest chants trended on social media. Online she is known as ""Kandaka"" or the Nubian queen. Thanks to social media, the protests rapidly caught international attention and support from human rights groups and Sudanese living abroad. In a statement, the EU's foreign ministers urged for an immediate end to all forms of violence against Sudanese civilians. But not all Sudanese civilians are against the army. Some people, in fact, want a tough military rule to give the country security and strength. The army supporters have placed their faith in General Abdel Fattah Burhan, the head of the Transitional Military Council. The real power, however, lies not with General Abdel Fattah Burhan, but his deputy, General Mohammed Hamdan Daglu, also known as ""Hemeti."" He heads the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) who cracked down brutally on the protesters. During the war in Darfur, he commanded the feared Janjaweed militias. The protesters fear that he could, in the end, take power. Politicians of other Arab nations have been watching the developments in Sudan with a certain degree of concern. Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, it is believed, fears that successful grassroots protests could set an example for citizens in the Arab Peninsula. Both the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia appear to be supporting the military regime. Cairo seems similarly concerned about the events in Khartoum. Egyptian president Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi (pictured l. with Omar al-Bashir in 2018) fears that the Muslim Brotherhood, which Eygpt has been trying to silence, could fall on fertile ground in Sudan. If the Muslim Brotherhood gains support in Sudan, al-Sisi believes that its success might strengthen the group again in Egypt. In Sudan, the protests continue unabated. Military leaders on Monday, June 23, turned down a proposal for a power-sharing deal. The protest leaders, represented by the coalition Forces for Declaration of Freedom and Change, which includes the Sudanese Professional's Association, had accepted the deal which was negotiated with the help of Ethiopia.

The EU has described the free trade deal as ""the most ambitious free trade deal ever concluded with a developing country."" European Union Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom and Vietnam's Minister of Industry and Trade Tran Tuan Anh signed the EVFTA in Hanoi on Sunday, three-and-a-half years after negotiations ended in December 2015. The agreement still needs to be ratified by the European Parliament. Some EU some lawmakers oppose such deals with Vietnam because of the country's poor human rights record. Economic boost Vietnam has one of the fastest-growing economies in Southeast Asia. Backed by robust exports and foreign investment, the country has already signed several free trade pacts, including an 11-country deal known as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). The EU is Vietnam's second-largest export market after the United States, with main exports including garment and footwear products. In 2018, Vietnam exported $42.5 billion (€37.32 billion) worth of goods and services to the EU, while the value of imports from the region reached $13.8 billion (€12.12 billion), according to official data.

As a result of the agreement, clothes, shoes and smartphones may soon get cheaper in the EU, while almost all tariffs will disappear. The free trade deal shows what an economic transition Vietnam has made. Experts say that Vietnam is also benefiting from an ongoing trade war between China and the US, as major companies are moving their production to Vietnam to avoid the US penalties. Human rights concerns Rights organizations have been trying to persuade the EU not to sign the free trade deal with Vietnam due to severe human rights violations and curbs on free speech in the country. They argue that the EU should not have signed the deal without Vietnamese authorities having taken measures to improve the rights situation in the country. Earlier in June, climate activist Nguyen Ngoc Anh was sentenced to six years in prison for a series of ""anti-state"" Facebook posts. Human Rights campaigners said this was part of an ""ongoing crackdown"" on dissent. The EU also condemned the arrest, calling it a ""worrying development.""

The bloc's member states are hoping to decide on a candidate to replace Jean-Claude Juncker as commission head before the first session of the new European Parliament begins on July 2. Weber had seemed the most likely choice, given that he is the leading candidate of the biggest group in the Parliament — the center-right European People's Party (EPP). But the conservative from Germany has failed to attract enough support from other parties. Citing sources close to EU officials, Welt reported that Weber had been eliminated from the race following consultations between EU leaders and the different European party groups.The sources also said German Chancellor Angela Merkel, a Weber supporter, had already accepted the decision. At the Osaka summit, Merkel merely said that a solution should be found ""on the basis of the prime candidates"" agreed on in the bloc.

Temperatures in the country's central Rhine-Main region and into eastern Germany were expected to reach up to 39 degrees on Sunday, according to the German Weather Service (DWD). Organizers of Sunday's Frankfurt Ironman event made contingency plans to keep athletes from overheating. As huge crowds gathered in Paris for the annual gay pride parade, firefighters sprayed water on revelers, some of whom used rainbow-colored fans and umbrellas to counter the heat, which was expected to hit 38 degrees.

Wildfires have scorched swaths of Tasmania, offshore from continental Australia's Victoria state, where residents last month faced a record heat wave. Australia's Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) blames the trend partly on record-warm southern Tasman Sea temperatures that have blocked rain-bearing cold weather fronts.

The idea was to finally create a widespread network of charging stations across Germany so that by 2030 there would be between 7 million and 10.5 million electric cars on the roads. Germany currently has only 16,000 charging stations. Last year, only 83,000 of 47.1 million vehicles were e-cars. A paltry figure compared to China's 2.6 million electric cars — that's 5% of all vehicles. Beijing plans for electric cars, hybrid and fuel cell cars to make up 20% of all vehicles by 2025. Read more: Does Europe, does Germany really need its own battery cells? A powerful hub of the car industry In 2014, Chinese President Xi Jinping declared that China would only be able to become a powerful hub of the car industry if it developed cars that ran on alternative energies. Over the past 15 years, the government has invested the equivalent of some €50 million ($57 million) into promoting e-mobility. Strict vehicle emission standards in big cities are also helping to promote e-cars, which are subsidized and more likely to receive permits. But there is plenty of room for improvement. Send Facebook Twitter google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/3GrD5 Pioneering Chinese tech giants such as Alibaba and Tencent were quick to invest in the industry. There was so much digital know-how in China that relative newcomers could afford to challenge established foreign companies such as Tesla, Daimler and Ford. This triggered a start-up boom in China, where there are some 490 electric carmakers today. DW columnist Frank Sieren National carmakers control about 95% of China's car market. Foreign carmakers have not really been able to make inroads in the e-market. German carmakers are still trying to get ahead using technology, while many customers in Asia seem more interested in the entertainment possibilities offered by digital technology. That makes them more likely to be interested in a car's touchscreen than its cylinder capacity or in making sure that it boasts a good digital stereo system for when they are stuck in traffic jams rather than concentrating on its crumple zone. The shrinking Chinese car market After 30 years of steady growth, the Chinese car market shrank by 3.8% in 2018. Although the market for e-vehicles is still growing, a downward trend is predicted. By April 2019, 18% of new registrations had been allocated to electric cars, fuel cell cars and hybrid vehicles. Last year, this figure was 62%. Even the companies on which many hopes have been pinned, such as Chinese Tesla rival Nio, which went public in New York last September, are struggling. Send Facebook Twitter google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/3EVs9 The trade dispute with the United States has, of course, raised uncertainty among customers and investors, but this is not the only issue. There are simply too many open questions concerning e-mobility in China. Which company of almost 500 will survive in the end? Will there be a smooth transition from attractive prototypes to mass production? Could hydroelectric cars soon be a serious alternative? By mid-June this year, China' electric automakers had only managed to attract $783 million worth of investment. Last year, they had attracted $6 billion by the same time and $7.7 billion over the whole year. Radical reduction of subsidies This is all according to plan. China's e-market is in a consolidation phase. Beijing will halve subsidies for electric cars with a range of at least 250 kilometers (155 miles) this year and cut them entirely next year. This is a controlled mass extinction program to let the market choose the fittest company. The move is a good mix of planned and market economy. The government pushed the companies so that they could take to the highway, but now that they are off and running the support dries up. To survive, Chinese carmakers will have to expand into the international market. This is not good for Germany's car industry. In the future, there will be more e-vehicles on German highways and a good number of them will be Chinese. Frank Sieren has lived in Beijing for over 20 years.

As climate activist Greta Thunberg mobilizes Spain's youth, many are wondering if policymakers in the country have really got the memo regarding the importance of environmental protection and renewable energies to the southern European nation. At the recent Med7 meeting of Mediterranean countries, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said his nation had to take the lead in climate protection in Europe, indicating that the rise of temperatures and strong winds were already having an impact on Spain's most stable source of income — tourism. Spain a green world power? Tourism still secures the most jobs in Spain, a country traditionally suffering from high structural unemployment. For the government it's clear that the tourism sector has to be supported in any possible way. This is why Sanchez attended the ""Change the Change"" climate protection conference in San Sebastian earlier this year to support the call for speeding up climate-protecting measures. ""We have to be serious about meeting our climate targets|"" said Sanchez, who aspires to spearhead Europe's campaign. He intends to put forward Teresa Ribera, his environment and energy minister, for the post of vice president of the European Commission. Luis Mereno from the Energias Renovables journal has recently praised her for scrapping a tax on self-installed solar panels, saying she had prepared the ground for a new energy policy in the country. Producing solar power costs far less in Spain than it does in most other Europen nations Mereno believes Ribera is a very talented and competent minister in the Sanchez cabinet. Taking the lead At the moment, Spain still has to import €40 billion ($45 billion) worth of gas and oil annually, mainly from Algeria and Saudi Arabia. It could save at least part of that money by boosting solar energy. Spain boasts 3,000 hours of sun per year and has many unused areas where solar farms could be built, says Jose Carlos Diez from the University of Alcala, near Madrid. ""We produce 1 megawatt of solar electricity for €30 — in Germany and France you pay €40 for the same amount; in Britain even €60|"" said Diez. Energy costs are also crucial for the tourism sector, being one of the largest energy consumers and accounting for 15% of gross domestic product (GDP). Passenger aviation and the cruising industry have increasingly become the target of criticism from environmental pressure groups. The latter have also criticized high water consumption in hotels and at golf courses. Water treatment has also been identified as a major problem. In tourist hotspots such as Majorca, the Canary Islands or Benidorm, water from the tap still has to be filtered. A lot of energy is consumed in the roughly 750 desalination plants, which pump the salt back into the ocean, thus changing the underwater landscape near the coasts. Desalination, which has been used in Spain since 1964, has paved the way for mass tourism in the first place. Today, Spain only trails Saudi Arabia, the US and the United Arab Emirates in desalinating the most water, according to Spain's AEDyR industry group. The desalinated water is used in agriculture and on many golf courses, which are also in evidence in the dry southern parts of the country. The sea levels threat Not only is Spain a tourist magnet, it's also one of the world's largest exporters of agricultural products. Farmers have also drawn the ire of environmentalists. The latter say farmers waste a lot of water, use pesticides and damage the soil through dubious cultivation schemes. At least that's the opinion of Madrid-based tech entrepreneur Rafael Alvarez. Cruising ships like these here in Palma, Majorca, have been identified as heavy polluters by environmentalists Rising sea levels are a huge problem for Spain, he says. He's convinced that in the years ahead many beaches and fields will be flooded. In the north of the country, there's mounting soil erosion along the 5,978 kilometers (3715 miles) of coast where 90% of all tourists spend their vacations. Inigo Losada, research director at the Environmental Hydraulics Institute of Cantabria, warns that holiday homeowners and hotel chains will feel the pinch. Diving gets less attractive for tourists, if coral reefs disappear, he argues, and the danger of coastal areas being flooded doesn't help tourism either. Major Spanish tour companies such as Melia, Barcelo, Iberostar and Riu are preparing for the worst. Melia has already inquired about how hotels in the affected regions can get adequate insurance packages. Losada says German holiday homeowners in Spain should do the same. ""I have no way of knowing whether we'll be able to stop climate change|"" he warns, indicating that in his opinion some people should already relocate to be on the safe side. ""But no one wants to talk about such things|"" says Tim Wirth, a real estate lawyer, who's also active on Majorca. ""Because they're afraid it could make people panic.""

From July 1, the EU would no longer recognize Swiss stock-exchange regulations as being equivalent to its own. Switzerland, last week announced a ""protective"" plan — set to take effect on Monday — that would bar EU exchanges from trading in certain Swiss shares. EU-based brokers and banks usually generate more than half of the turnover on Swiss stock markets, including holdings in heavyweights such as Nestle, Roche and Novartis. Although not directly linked with the partnership treaty, preferrential treatment termination is being used by the EU as a bargaining chip to get Bern to ratify the deal. The partnership treaty, in the works since 2014 and officially known as the Institutional Framework Agreement, is supposed to ""ensure a more uniform and efficient"" governance on issues such as mutual market access and labor movement between the alpine nation and surrounding EU neighbors. Although not a member of the EU, Switzerland already has some 20 bilateral agreements with the bloc and even makes a financial contribution to the EU. After the USA and China, it is the EU's third largest trading partner. Ratification withheld, pending election Under the treaty text, Switzerland would be aligned with EU single market rules, including freedom of movement precepts and scrutiny by the European Court of Justice (ECJ). Switzerland has however withheld ratification, with a parliamentary election due next October and its citizens entitled to force a referendum on the issue. A six-month extension, granted last December, expires this Sunday, June 30. Two-pronged alliance Opposed to giving Brussels too much perceived sway have been the right-wing anti-EU Swiss People's Party (SWP) and the center-left Social Democrats (SP).

The claims made by former ifo president Hans-Werner Sinn, physics professor Christoph Buchal and ifo energy expert Hans-Dieter Long could deal a big blow to this country's efforts to reduce traffic-related CO2 by 40% over the next decade. Germany is heading down a blind alley, the authors boldly state, because electric vehicles will ""barely help to cut emissions"" as battery-powered cars emit between 10% and ""up to a quarter"" more CO2 than a conventional diesel car. The research trio compared the CO2 footprint of a Tesla Model 3 with those of a Mercedes 220d diesel car and a Mercedes C Class model converted from petrol to liquefied natural gas (LNG). Their focus was on the cars' whole life cycle emissions — from the first nut welded right down to the cars' final kilometer. The life cycle in terms of distance driven was arbitrarily set at 150,000 kilometers (93,205 miles) for better judgement. Send Facebook Twitter google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/38BXk EU greenwashing? The European Commission currently counts electric cars as ""zero-emission vehicles"" as it seeks to push car fleet emissions in Europe below 95 grams of CO2 per kilometer (152.8 grams/mile) by 2021. In the decade to follow, a cut of another 35% is decreed, down to 59 g/km (94.9 grams/mile). The ifo study calls this into question, saying that EVs are neither emissions-free nor are these targets achievable without cooking the data. The authors admit that carbon data especially on the upstream parts of the manufacturing process is still weak. But all available information on CO2 emitted during manufacturing, battery and fuel production, as well as electricity generation, already suggests the Tesla 3 electric car leaves the heaviest carbon footprint of the three, at least within the context of Germany's energy mix. Ifo used the EU's NEDC (New European Driving Cycle) standard setting emissions from driving at 83 grams per kilometer (133.5 g/mile) for the Tesla Model 3, 117 g/km for the Mercedes diesel and 76 g/km for the Mercedes LNG. NEDC was replaced in 2018 by the WLTP standard, measuring emissions more accurately and meaning they are higher for all models It's the battery! The study calculated that making an electric vehicle and a conventional combustion engine car creates more or less the same amount of CO2 — 8.6 tons per car. About 4.9 tons needed to produce the body of a car and 1.9 tons emitted during the assembly process. Moreover, the study has found that producing a diesel motor causes slightly higher emissions (0.8 tons) than making the electric motors (0.3 tons) driving the Tesla 3. But while the Tesla's ""additional components"" account for 1.5 tons of CO2 per car, those of the Mercedes 220d create just 1 ton, the study claims. Regarding so-called well-to-tank emissions of fossil fuels, the study uses an analysis done by the European Commission itself. Most significant for the comparison though, is the footprint of EV battery production and recycling. There, ifo used the figures provided by a 2017 Swedish study into the energy required to produce lithium-ion batteries for cars. The German energy mix/mess The fact that the carbon count tips clearly in favor of combustion engines is primarily the result of Germany's fossil-fuel-heavy energy production, the researchers however say. While Norway's energy production for example relies heavily on renewable energy from water power — which may give the Tesla 3 a carbon lead over its Mercedes rivals — that's not the case given Germany's energy mix. In the opinion of the researchers, Germany's dirty energy situation isn't going to change over the next five years. Due to a government decision to completely phase out nuclear energy by 2022, about 76 terawatt-hours (tWh) of power need to be replaced annually. Since this shortfall is planned to be covered by power from fossil fuels, mainly natural gas, Germany's energy mix is set to become even dirtier. Should hard coal be used as a replacement, the study calculated, the carbon footprint of a Tesla 3 EV would even spike to 175 to 200 g/km — roughly 25% more than the emissions of the Mercedes diesel and more than double that of the LNG car. Germany wants to cover the nuclear shortfall with renewable power as quickly as possible, and aims to increase energy from green sources to about 85% by 2050. But the researchers argue that under the current pace of the renewables buildup of 15 tWh annually, making up for the nuclear phaseout alone will take at least until 2025. They also claim a carbon-neutral German energy production might turn out to be both technically unfeasible and economically unviable. Criticism The study, naturally, invited a strong backlash from e-mobility proponents, who strongly questioned the findings. The Fraunhofer ISI think tank, a renowned research group advocating e-mobility, criticised the use of the Tesla 3 as a reference model, arguing the car's battery was too powerful to be used as an example for average car CO2 measurements. In a response issued on Tuesday, Fraunhofer ISI also said ifo had used the outdated NEDC standard for measuring the Mercedes' fuel consumption, which in real driving situations, measured by the new WLTP standard, was much higher. This point, however, could also be raised with the 15 kilowatt-hours per 100 kilometers (15 kWh/93 miles) that Tesla touts for its Model 3. Road testing by the German newspaper FAZ suggests this is actually around 24 kWh/100km. Another criticism concerned the carbon data from battery production, which was allegedly too high. Critics says ifo hadn't given due regard to the renewables buildup planned in Germany, which would make electric car charging ever more greener in the decade ahead. On Wednesday, German carmaker Volkswagen, which wants to sell 10 million EVs in the coming years, also stepped into the fray. It admitted that under current German energy conditions its fully-electric Golf would emit 142 g/km over a life cycle of 200,000 kilometers, while a diesel-driven car of the same type would create only 140 g/km. But VW also noted that using the European energy mix for calculations, which includes large amounts of nuclear energy from France and water power from Norway, the e-Golf's carbon footprint would be down to 119 g/km. In view of the controversy, ifo's researchers argue their study should not be seen as a complete piece of scientific research into electromobility's carbon footprint. Yet, they are sticking to their judgement that the electric car is not a panacea in the fight against climate change.

The president also said he had signed the death warrants for four drug convicts and they would be executed soon. Sirisena's office has said the president wanted the hangings to send a powerful message to anyone engaged in the illegal drugs trade. Sri Lanka has been grappling with drug-related crimes for years and the country is believed to be a transit hub for drug peddlers. Read more: Sri Lanka's Catholics and Muslims deeply divided by terror attacks The decision to reinstate capital punishment, however, has been criticized by human rights groups as well as the international community. Sirisena said Monday he had rejected a telephone appeal by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres to reconsider his push to reintroduce the death penalty. Sirisena also accused the European Union of interfering in the internal affairs of his country, saying that EU diplomats had threatened him with tariffs if Sri Lanka went ahead with the executions. Sirisena's decision to reinstate capital punishment has been slammed by the human rights groups In a DW interview, Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said that the alleged deterrent effect of the death penalty has been repeatedly debunked. DW: What are your views on the Sri Lankan government's move to end a moratorium on the death penalty? Meenakshi Ganguly: Sri Lanka's decision to issue death warrants is extremely disturbing. Human Rights Watch opposes the death penalty because it is inherently cruel. Sri Lanka, with a 43-year de facto moratorium, was an example to others. It is unfortunate that even as many other nations are committing to abolish the practice, the Sri Lankan government has chosen to be regressive. We hope that the government will revoke the death warrants, reinstate the moratorium on capital punishment, and take steps to abolish it altogether. Read more: The war widows protecting Sri Lanka's mangroves Some say the decision to reinstate capital punishment after over 40 years of moratorium was an electoral gambit, aimed at boosting Sirisena's chances of reelection as president. What's your take on this? Apart from the fact that the death penalty is inhumane, it is also irreversible. To reinstate the practice, if motivated by a political calculus, is particularly irresponsible. President Sirisena renewed calls for the death penalty following a visit to the Philippines in January, during which he called President Rodrigo Duterte's ""war on drugs"" an ""example to the world."" A decision to restore the death penalty because he was inspired by the Philippines' murderous ""drug war"" may be the worst possible justification and a violation of international law. Ganguly: 'Apart from the fact that the death penalty is inhumane, it is also irreversible' President Sirisena has signed death warrants for four drug offenders and says he wants the hangings to send a powerful message to anyone engaged in the illegal drugs trade. Is this the right way to go about tackling illegal drugs? Where the death penalty is permitted, international human rights law limits the death penalty to ""the most serious crimes|"" typically crimes resulting in death or serious bodily harm. The UN Human Rights Committee and the special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary, or arbitrary executions have concluded that the death penalty for drug offenses fails to meet the condition of ""most serious crime."" In September 2015, the UN high commissioner for human rights reaffirmed that ""persons convicted of drug-related offences … should not be subject to the death penalty."" How do you think the death penalty will affect Sri Lanka's relations with the international community? The decision to reverse its moratorium on capital punishment will disappoint many of Sri Lanka's friends in the international community. The United Nations General Assembly has continually called on countries to establish a moratorium on the death penalty, progressively restrict the practice, and reduce the offenses for which it might be imposed — all with a view toward its eventual abolition. Will diplomatic appeals help prevent executions in Sri Lanka? We hope that the government will heed calls from human rights activists at home and abroad, as well as its friends in the international community. What can human rights groups do to persuade the Sri Lankan government to change its course? President Sirisena believes that his decision will be popular because he is acting against drug traffickers, but he needs to understand that the alleged deterrent effect of the death penalty has been repeatedly debunked. Instead Sri Lanka should take into account the UN Office on Drugs and Crime which has called for an end to the death penalty and specifically urged member countries to prohibit use of the death penalty for drug-related offenses, while urging countries to take an overall ""human rights-based approach to drug and crime control.""

Isso, along with hundreds of thousands of people of the Gedeo ethnic minority, had run from violent clashes between Gedeos and neighboring Oromos, Ethiopia's largest ethnic group. The looting and killing was triggered by long-simmering conflict over land. The verdant rolling hills of this region – where some of the world's best coffee is grown – has long been facing a critical shortage of arable land. A growing population and rising unemployment further fuel the tension. According to the Organization for Migration, approximately 820,000 people were uprooted in Gedeo district and 150,000 in the bordering West Guji zone of Oromia when the violence flared a year ago. Isso has now come back because the government insists that it's safe to return. But he's too terrified to visit his fields which lie a few kilometers outside of his village. ""Our lives were good before. We had animals, and our house was furnished. We drank milk and ate chicken and mutton|"" Isso said. Isso hails from a tiny village on the border of two regions: the ethnically diverse Southern Nations, Nationalities and People's region; and the Oromia region, mainly inhabited by Oromo people. Liberalization ignites old conflicts Ethiopia – which has more than 80 ethno-linguistic groups – is divided under the constitution into nine ethnic federal states. Since Abiy Ahmed was inaugurated as Prime Minister in April 2018, the borders between these ethnic regions have experienced multiple deadly clashes. By December 2018, some 2.9 million had fled their homes to escape violence within the nation – giving Ethiopia the unenviable distinction of having the highest number of internally displaced people worldwide. This inter-ethnic violence is the biggest stain on the record of Abiy, who has positioned himself as an open and reform-oriented leader and is feted internationally as a source of hope. In the weeks after he took office, he freed hundreds of political prisoners and activists, lifted bans on political parties countrywide and ended a 20-year border war with Eritrea. However, this liberal stance is now allowing the eruption of historical hostilities that had been suppressed by the authoritarian security apparatus of previous leaders. Questions of borders between regions are suddenly under debate again – and the topic of political representation is beset with tension ahead of national elections slated for May 2020. Ethiopia has been a de facto one-party state having been ruled by the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front since 1991. The old guard – mainly ethnic Tigrayans – view Abiy and his moves to make Ethiopia a democracy as a threat. Since he was elected, dozens of former Tigrayan officials have been prosecuted for corruption and human rights abuses. But such actions have provoked resistance to Abiy's reform process. Read more: Ethiopia: Gedeo-Oromo ethnic clashes continue amid political reforms Crucial moment for Ethiopia The precariousness of Ethiopia's political landscape was evident on June 23, 2019, when attacks that authorities described as an attempted coup in the northern Amhara Region claimed several lives. These included Amhara governor Ambachew Mekonnen, his top adviser and the state’s attorney general, who were shot at a meeting in the state capital of Bahir Dar. A few hours later in the capital Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's army chief, General Seare Mekonnen, was shot dead by his body guard in a killing that the government says was linked to the Amhara assassinations. Ethiopian soldiers weeped during at the army chief's funeral on 25 June 2019 Authorities subsequently arrested hundreds of people suspected of supporting those responsible for the attacks. It also cut off the internet for six days. ""It's a very critical juncture|"" said Felix Home, an Ethiopia expert at Human Rights Watch, referring to the the breakdown in law and order and the insecurity in Ethiopia. The government's response to the ethnic violence and millions of internally displaced people has been ""one of almost indifference|"" he told DW. However, Abiy's government can't afford to underestimate the destabilizing effects of regional ethnic militants, Home warned. ""One of the manifestations of this rise in insecurity and breakdown of law and order is the rise of local armed groups. … At the same time there's a proliferation of weapons in many parts of the country|"" he said. In addition, many Ethiopians are disgruntled about the present and nervous about the future. The government isn't paying enough attention to this ""toxic combination"", Home said.

Authorities insist the tension between the Oromos and Gedeos has calmed down. ""There is not much of a security problem in our zone|""Aberra Buno, the chief of administration in West Guji. ""When displaced people return to their homes, we bring them together with the Oromos so that they can talk|"" he told DW. West Guji administrator Aberra Buno downplays the fears Gedeo returnees have of more violence However, humanitarian organizations have criticized forcing returns. They say the government's plans, lack of transparency and details and forcing people home will only add to the hunger and suffering. As for the Gedeos, many are still fearful. Together with her four children, Dingete returned to West Guji a few weeks ago. ""We are happy to be here but I am worried|"" she told DW. She has heard that the armed groups responsible for the attack on her home are still at large. ""My land is far from here and that's why I am afraid of going there|"" she said. Many other returnees also also too scared to work their fields, leaving them unable to cultivate their food and lacking a source of income. Authorities have promised deliveries of seeds but it's not clear when this will happened.

The mission had sought to curtail Libyan people smugglers on the Mediterranean and simultaneously build up Libya's coast guard. During its four-year duration, tens of thousands of refugees were rescued by EU vessels, with many of them being brought to Italy. Back in 2015, the Italian government said it would take in all those rescued at sea, yet later changed its position, arguing that the number of people arriving was too many to handle. National interests over human compassion Two years ago, Italy's Social Democratic government urged refugees be redistributed throughout the EU. Most member states, not just Hungary and Poland, opposed this. Then, in the summer of 2018, Italy's new populist government barred all rescued refugees on EU vessels from disembarking at Italian ports. Italy's far-right interior minister, Matteo Salvini, had delivered on his callous agenda and was happy to portray himself as someone who stands up to Brussels. Bernd Riegert is DW's European correspondent From now on, Operation Sophia will be reduced to a largely symbolic aerial surveillance operation. The move is a disgrace, and it proves that in the EU today, national interests are afforded greater importance than human compassion. What will happen to those people who climb into unseaworthy rubber boats, risking their lives to get from North Africa to Europe? Will even more refugees drown in the Mediterranean? We will probably never find out, with no more EU vessels on patrol and most ships run by nongovernmental organizations unable to operate. We will no longer know how many refugees are coming, and by which route. It is a tragedy. The mission that preceded operation Sophia was in fact established following Italy's urgent request in the wake of several high-profile humanitarian catastrophes, such as when hundreds of migrants drowned off the island of Lampedusa in October 2013. Have we already forgotten these horrors? Today, apparently, all that matters is shutting the borders — no matter the humanitarian cost. Read more: Widespread torture and rape documented in Libya's refugee camps We can't know for certain, as some politicians have claimed, whether the possibility of being rescued by an EU ship actually enticed some people to climb into an unseaworthy boat in the first place and head for the European coast. This supposed ""pull"" factor has now been eliminated, as the number of migrants bound for the continent has sharply dropped in the last year. The EU has vowed to continue training and equipping the Libyan coast guard, hoping it will prevent refugees from attempting to make it across the Mediterranean to Europe. Does this mean everything is taken care of? Not at all. Libya's current unstable political state means the coast guard is unable to patrol the entire length of the coast. And some people smugglers apparently work hand-in-hand with these patrols, too. Common EU refugee policy lies in ruins The end of Operation Sophia means the EU has failed in its attempt to establish a common refugee policy. Despite years of endless discussions, the bloc's interior ministers could never agree on how rescued refugees should be redistributed around the bloc, how the asylum system should be reformed, or which country should carry responsibility for respective asylum-seekers. And measures to boost security on the EU's external borders have been postponed until 2027. All the talk of a ""repatriation agreement|"" of creating transit camps inside the EU, and disembarkation points in North Africa, have led to naught — although European leaders last summer lauded the plans as a pivotal step in deterring migrants. Read more: Follow the money — what are the EU's migration policy priorities?

The protest over the French government's environment policies was held by members of the Extinction Rebellion group at the Pont de Sully bridge during sweltering heat on Friday. A video shared on Twitter and since widely broadcast on news channels shows a group of protesters sitting on the ground with their arms linked and heads bowed after they had refused orders to vacate the bridge. When they refuse to move, officers spray them with hand-held teargas canisters, while the demonstrators try to protect their faces. The video shows one officer forcibly remove a protester's protective goggles and sunglasses. The officers are then seen dragging the protesters off the street one by one. A police officer at the scene estimated about 90 protesters had taken part, while Extinction Rebellion put the number at 200, the Guardian reported.

The Paris police department said the officers had intervened to stop the protesters from blocking traffic and that the demonstrators had been ordered ""several times"" to move. It said two people were arrested. The video received condemnation both in France and abroad, with Sweden's teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg tweeting a link to the video with the words: ""Watch this video and ask yourself; who is defending who?"" The Extinction Rebellion group first launched in Britain and organizes acts of civil disobedience to draw attention to climate issues. Last month, the group took part in the blockade of an open-pit coal mine in Germany and protests held in London in May brought parts of the British capital to a standstill. Beginning April 15, protesters with Extinction Rebellion took to the streets of London and other cities to demand governments declare a climate and ecological emergency. They occupied key spots in the city, calling on those in charge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2025, halt biodiversity loss and set up citizens' assemblies on climate and ecological justice. Extinction Rebellion, founded last year by academics in the United Kingdom, is one of the world's fastest-growing environmental movements. Their aim is to protest climate change inaction in a creative and nonviolent way. Demonstrators say people are causing their own mass extinction, which is the basis of their ""rebellion."" Harry and Meghan, the duke and duchess of Sussex, didn't exactly take part in the sit-in on London's Waterloo Bridge on April 18. The royals are expecting and protesters used the happy event in their demonstration, having the couple ""thank"" Extinction Rebellion for saving their child's future. Activists have used a variety of unusual protest methods to draw maximum attention and get their point across. Throughout the week, they've blocked traffic, climbed atop buses and superglued themselves to buildings and, in the case of this young man at London's Canary Wharf station on April 17, trains. The goal of the protests is to temporarily disrupt everyday life. As a result, police have arrested more than 800 people in London alone. Activists want to get the public on their side, but a YouGov survey showed that just 36% of more than 3,500 British polled support the protest, with 52% against. Extinction Rebellion protesters first attracted global attention on April 1, during yet another heated Brexit debate in the British Parliament. A group of semi-naked activists revealed themselves in the visitor gallery with slogans including ""SOS"" and ""Stop Wasting Time"" written on their bodies, with some gluing their hands to a glass barrier. The scene was quickly broken up my security. The Extinction Rebellion protests got their start in London, but the movement has also spread to other major cities around the world. On April 15, these activists on the Oberbaum Bridge in Berlin blocked traffic for hours. On April 21, organizers in London said they were willing to switch tactics and talk with the government. ""We're giving them an opportunity now to come and speak to us|"" said spokesman James Fox.

EU Council President Donald Tusk, who is leading the talks, said leaders would reconvene on Tuesday. The impasse is centered on the nominee to succeed outgoing Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. This requires the approval of 21 of the 28 EU leaders, representing 65% of the bloc's population. Once EU leaders nominate candidates, these must be approved by the European Parliament. Read more: What are the top EU jobs and who decides on them? A package of options Current European Commission vice-president Frans Timmermans of the Netherlands, who was the Progressive Alliance of Socialists & Democrats' (S&D) lead candidate in May's European elections, was rumored to be the favorite in the race to succeed Juncker as president of the Commission. World Bank chief executive Kristalina Georgieva was rumored to be Tusk's likely successor as president of the European Council, with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager or the current interim Prime Minister of Belgium, Charles Michel, in the running to be the bloc's next foreign policy chief. The S&D's Timmermans was the compromise choice in a deal reportedly forged by French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the G20 summit in Japan, and which also included other top EU posts. The deal was also backed by Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez. Frans Timmermans of the Netherlands was backed by France and Spain But the conservative European People's Party (EPP), which finished ahead of the socialists in the parliamentary elections, was not backing down on its support for their candidate, German lawmaker Manfred Weber. Among the EU leaders who have reportedly objected to Timmermans are Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Croatia, Slovakia and Ireland. The outgoing vice-president of the Commission has spearheaded EU efforts to crack down on authoritarian-leaning eastern EU members through the bloc's rule of law norm. ""The vast majority of EPP prime ministers don't believe that we should give up the presidency quite so easily, without a fight|"" Ireland's center-right Prime Minister Leo Varadkar had told reporters on Sunday. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban had sent a letter to the EPP warning that Timmermans' nomination would be ""a historical mistake."" The center-right European People's Party (EPP) — the largest faction in the European Parliament — has picked Manfred Weber, its German parliamentary party leader. He has the backing of Chancellor Angela Merkel. Though considered the front-runner, Weber is little known on the international stage, and his language skills are considered poor. Frans Timmermans, the European Commission's first vice president, will lead the campaign for the Progressive Alliance of Socialists & Democrats (S&D). Weber's main rival promises to bring the bloc closer to ordinary voters at a time when Britain's looming exit is one factor behind the nationalist movements across the EU. Margrethe Vestager, 51, is one of seven lead candidates for the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats. As the current EU commissioner for competition, the Danish MEP has taken on corporations like Apple, Amazon and Google parent Alphabet. It's also been said that she served as the inspiration for the main character in Borgen, a Danish series where a woman becomes Denmark's first female leader. The third-largest group in the EU Parliament, the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR), has just one candidate: Jan Zahradil, chairman of the Czech ECR delegation. Zahradil, 65, is affectionately known as ""Forrest Gump"" for cycling from Prague to Strasbourg for a session of the European Parliament and for once running 1,300 kilometers (about 800 miles) across the Czech Republic for charity. The Greens/EFA is the seventh largest group in European Parliament, so the German is a long shot to become European Commission president. The Greens have proposed a job share, with two candidates serving for two-and-a-half years each. The most favorite to join Keller is Dutch lawmaker Bas Eickhout. The EU's left-wing groups will be headed by Spanish trade unionist Nico Cue and Violeta Tomic (at left). Tomic is a deputy in Slovenia's National Assembly, best known as a TV presenter and actress. She entered into politics in 2014 and has been an advocate for LGBT rights and stronger citizens' rights in Europe. Cue grew up in Belgium after his family was forced to flee Franco's Soain.

Carola Rackete, captain of the search and rescue vessel Sea-Watch 3, was arrested on Saturday by Italian authorities for ""resisting a warship"" after her ship hit a customs and border police motorboat in the Mediterranean port of Lampedusa. Though there were no injuries, Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini described the incident as ""an act of war."" If convicted, Rackete could face 10 years in prison. She may also face a fine of up to €50,000 ($58,000), recently imposed by the Italian authorities, for bringing rescued people into its docks without permission. Sicilian prosecutors have also opened an investigation against Rackete for supporting human trafficking. Read more: What drives Sea-Watch 3 captain Carola Rackete to rescue migrants? What international maritime laws did Sea-Watch 3 enforce? Sea-Watch 3 says that Rackete, a 31-year-old German, was following international maritime law by rescuing and bringing them to a safe harbor. ""There are certainly different areas of regulation that don't really chime in with one another|"" said Nele Matz-Lück, professor of international and maritime law at the University of Kiel. ""On the one hand, there is the level of international maritime law, which says that captains must rescue people and bring them to a safe place, but there is no obligation for coastal states to be that safe place."" For that reason, Salvini and the Italian coastguard were also within their rights to refuse entry to the ship and to use force to attempt to block the port. But, added Matz-Lück, it was of course ""definitely not true"" for Salvini to claim this constituted an ""act of war."" But it will be up to the Italian judiciary to decide how the incident between the boats is to be interpreted. In a statement released on Sunday, Sea-Watch said, ""Captain Rackete performed all maneuvers very slowly, in a non-confrontational manner so as to give the [Italian coastguard] boat plenty of time to get away from its position between the Sea-Watch 3 and the pier. … The two vessels only slightly touched each other."" Send Facebook Twitter google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/3LLTX There is also room for interpretation over the condition on board. Though ships are normally obliged to follow instructions from a port, if the captain considered the situation on board an emergency (if food was running out and people getting sick), she would have the right to force entry into the port. ""How bad the situation really is, is of course to a certain extent a question of interpretation|"" said Constantin Hruschka, senior researcher at the Max Planck Institute for social law and social policy in Munich. Read more: EU countries put pressure on refugee sea rescue missions Could Rackete be prosecuted under human trafficking laws? Under international law, trafficking ""is only prosecutable when there is a profit motive|"" said Hruschka. But that provision doesn't exist in Italian law. ""That's the big question now: Can a state decide that anyone who helps someone can be prosecuted|"" said Hruschka. ""EU laws say only that illegal immigration must be fought. And Salvini says it's much more efficient if everyone can be punished, rather than making exceptions. So there is a certain interpretative space, which is why the case is boiling up so much."" Why couldn't the refugees be brought back to Libya? Politicians from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) were among critics who suggested that Rackete could have brought the refugees back to Libya, from where their stricken boat had set off (Lampedusa is closer to North Africa than mainland Italy). ""For one thing, there is no obligation to bring anyone to the nearest port|"" said Matz-Lück. This rule ensures that trading ships, for instance, may continue on their intended route if they pick up people from stricken ships. ""But it does have to be a safe place|"" added Matz-Lück. ""And a safe place doesn't just mean dry land, it means a place where people can have their basic needs met. So Libya clearly didn't qualify."" Read more: Malta rescues 85 migrants from sinking vessel Why couldn't the migrants be brought to another European port? During the 16-day standoff between Sea-Watch 3 and the Italian authorities, many argued that Rackete should have taken the ship to another European country. After all, Italian Foreign Minister Enzo Moavero Milanesi said on Friday that five EU countries had offered to take the 40 migrants: France, Germany, Finland, Luxembourg, and Portugal. Rackete was arrested after she landed in Lampedusa But, according to Matz-Lück, maritime law offers the captain in such circumstances a lot of interpretative room. ""If she says the situation on board doesn't suit that, or the water supply, or the fuel supply don't suit it, then it's up to the captain if the ship travels on or not|"" she said. ""There are no clear legal regulations of what should be done in such situations."" Why can't rescued migrants be distributed across Europe? The European Union has no mechanism by which refugees rescued from the Mediterranean can be fairly and safely distributed across the bloc, which means, in effect, that there are likely to be more standoffs and crises like the one happening over Sea-Watch 3. ""If one could find a legal EU regulation agreed by everyone, they could be distributed|"" said Hruschka. ""But that's always been the problem, that there have been countries who have voluntarily agreed to take in a few people. But there's no mechanism."" In other words, for each individual ship that arrives in Europe, the question is always asked anew: Who will take them? Italy and Malta have both said they will not let anyone on land unless other countries have agreed to take them in. ""Why do they say that? Because if they land on their shores and make an asylum application and try to get protection, then the state would be responsible|"" Hruschka said. This is stipulated by the Dublin system. If other EU states said they would take the migrants, why wouldn't Italy open its port? This comes down to the hard-line stance taken by the Italian government. ""Salvini's idea is to close the ports altogether. He goes a step further; he says this is always trafficking, and so potentially criminal, and can't be allowed|"" said Hruschka. ""The political agenda among the individual countries is very different."""|"The standoff between Sea-Watch 3 and the Italian government ended with the arrest of Captain Carola Rackete, who now faces prosecution.

Turkey is increasing estranged from the United States and Western allies over differences on Syria, Ankara's planned purchase of Russia's S-400 missile system and democratic backsliding following the failed coup attempt in June 2016. The fallout has fueled speculation by some observers that NATO member Turkey may be rebalancing its strategic relations away from the West to the East – not least because Erdogan has suggested Turkey could join the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a regional security body composed of China, Russia and four Central Asian nations. Meanwhile, the ongoing US-China trade dispute coincides with the world's two largest economies being locked in a geopolitical power struggle to define the future world order. However, Erdogan's eighth meeting with Xi since 2012 is more about economics and diversifying relations, not part of a strategic shift to the East, experts said. ""Turkey's relations with China cannot replace its alliance with the United States or relations with the European Union|"" said Altay Atli, a lecturer at Koc University in Istanbul who specializes on Turkish-Asian relations. ""Turkey has very deep and mutually beneficial relations with the West."" He added that Ankara's foreign policy aims to make Turkey an international actor capable of expanding relations with all countries, unlike during the Cold War when it was tied to the Western bloc. Kadir Temiz, a faculty member at Istanbul Sehir University, said that although China is becoming an important country for Turkey, the relationship centers on common interests in developing economic ties. ""Their biggest differences are political and geopolitical|"" he said. ""These political and geopolitical differences are likely to come to the fore in the future if there is a greater economic dependency."" One main area of divergence between Ankara and Beijing is over the Syrian civil war, where Turkey has backed the opposition and China has economically and politically supported the regime and Russia's military intervention. Belt and Road China-Turkey bilateral trade reached $23 billion in 2018 (20.3 billion euros), according to the Turkish Statistics Office, making China Turkey's third largest trading partner. The trade relationship is marked by a massive $18 billion imbalance in China's favor, something that Turkey seeks to address by expanding exports and attracting Chinese investment at a time its economy is struggling.

Washington and its European allies have warned that the Chinese plan to finance and build infrastructure across the globe could lead to a debt trap, creating dependency on Beijing for its strategic gain.

At odds over the Uyghurs Erdogan, who in 2009 accused Beijing of committing ""a kind of genocide"" against the Uyghurs, has remained relatively mute in recent years as China has rounded up an estimated one million people from the mostly Muslim, Turkic ethnic group in western Xinjiang province. The plight of their ethnic Turkic cousins has long stirred passions among religious-nationalist circles and the Uyghur diaspora in Turkey.

Beijing says these Syrian trained Uyghur jihadis have carried out attacks in western China and fears that more battle-hardened fighters will return to wage war. On the Uyghur issue, Ankara wants to avoid angering China at a time its economy is weak. At the same time, China fears that Erdogan, a widely popular figure in Muslim world, could stir anti-Chinese sentiment if were too vocal about the treatment of the Uyghurs. ""Turkey is trying to follow a careful policy on this|"" said Atli, adding that the government has supported Chinese sovereignty and right to fight against terrorism, while expressing that not every Muslim is a terrorist.

Andrew Cainey, an Asia expert at the London-based Chatham House, told DW that the meeting ""highlights again the multipolar nature of the world today…the world is not just G2 [the US and China].""

""They can, no doubt, reach agreement on some issues: but their situations and interests are fundamentally different.""

And as predicted, Trump agreed to resume trade talks with China and said that Washington would not levy tariffs on all remaining imports from China — more than $300 billion worth. The US president also announced that American technology companies could again begin doing business with Chinese tech giant Huawei, reversing a ban that was put in place in May. Trump also promised Indian PM Modi ""very big"" trade deals. The talks marked a significant shift from the US president's statements condemning India's retaliatory taxes on imports from the US. Trump also congratulated Modi on his election victory, saying, ""It is a fantastic tribute to you and your abilities."" Trump's interaction with Russian President Putin was similarly friendly, with Trump playfully saying, ""Don't meddle in the election, president|"" as they spoke to reporters. Chatham House expert Cainey says the US needs to understand the significance of its actions. ""The challenge for the US — or, at least for some US leaders and policymakers — is understanding that US actions create their own reactions and second-order changes.""

Here's a roundup of what went down on Friday: Who is hosting and what do they want? Japan is hosting leaders from the world's top 20 economies in the western city of Osaka. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe appealed for unity among the sparring leaders, and urged a strong message in support of free trade. Japan will also be keeping close tabs on progress in reviving denuclearization talks with North Korea. Trump appeared to take Abe's appeal for unity to heart, as he toned down his usually derisive rhetoric and did a three-way fist bump with the Japanese leader and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. What does the G20 mean for locals? In stark contrast to the past two G20 summits, which saw massive protests and sometimes violent clashes erupt in the prior host cities of Buenos Aires and Hamburg, the streets in Osaka have been calm, and patrolled by some 30,000 police officers. Takashi Hatanaka, an employee at a hotel where G20 participants are staying, told DW's Bernd Riegert that the cordoned-off streets don't bother him. ""The guests are welcome. Japan can show that it is taking on responsibility in the world|"" he said. Trump played nice with world leaders at the G20 summit, pausing for a fist bump with Abe and Modi What's the main focus of day 1? Bilateral meetings took center stage on Friday, with world leaders moving through a breakneck schedule of sometimes tense talks with their counterparts. Leaders then came back together for a dinner to round off the day, before they reconvene on Saturday to try to reach an accord. What were the biggest one-on-one meetings? Much of the focus on Friday was on US President Donald Trump's talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, amid tensions over a myriad of issues including Moscow's interference in US elections. It was the first time the two leaders sat together since their first meeting last year in Helsinki, Sweden. At one point, a reporter asked Trump if he would tell Russia not to meddle in the upcoming US presidential election in 2020. The US leader then turned to Putin with a smile and said: ""Don't meddle in the election, please."" After the meeting, Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said that Trump reacted positively to an invitation from Putin to attend festivities in Moscow next year marking the 75th anniversary of the US and Russia's World War II victory in Europe. Outgoing UK Prime Minister Theresa May appeared to have a less friendly reception for Putin for their first meeting since the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal in Salisbury, which London has blamed on Moscow. The chilly relations between the UK and Russia were apparent during May's meeting with Putin What are the biggest bones of contention? The escalating trade war between the US and China has been overshadowing the summit, with world leaders concerned about the impact the rift between the world's top two economies is having on global markets. All eyes will be on Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping when they meet for talks on Saturday. Experts told DW that rather than making progress towards a solution, the two are more likely to agree to a truce, which could extend uncertainty. Besides trade, climate change is the second major sticking point at the summit, with Trump and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro uniting to push for nonbinding statements about efforts to address the crisis in the final summit communique. Escalating tensions between Iran and the US also permeated the talks. European leaders are trying to salvage the 2015 nuclear deal before Tehran makes good on a threat to exceed the maximum amount of enriched uranium it is allowed under the deal, which Trump pulled out of last year. Send Facebook Twitter google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/3LDeC Who's making trouble? Putin caused a stir ahead of the summit with an interview he gave to the Financial Times, during which he derided Western liberal values by saying they are ""obsolete."" He also said German Chancellor Angela Merkel made a ""cardinal mistake"" by welcoming refugees and migrants into Germany in 2015. European Council President Donald Tusk fired back, saying Europeans should ""firmly and unequivocally defend and promote liberal democracy."" ""What I find really obsolete are authoritarianism, personality cults, the rule of oligarchs, even if sometimes they may seem effective|"" he said. Merkel stuck to her full summit schedule despite appearing unwell the day before What is Angela Merkel up to? The German chancellor also had a packed schedule of meetings with world leaders, including India's Modi and China's Xi, as well as Trump. Following their meeting, the US leader said Merkel was ""a fantastic person, a fantastic woman."" Just two days earlier, he'd called Germany ""delinquent"" for not spending enough on defense for NATO. Merkel held brief talks with French President Emmanuel Macron at the start of the summit amid ongoing discussions over who will become the next European Commission president. Merkel also appeared to be feeling well on the first day of the summit, which came a day after the chancellor was shaking and unsteady during a public event in Berlin for the second time within two weeks.

After months of delay, European powers meeting with Iranian officials in Vienna last Friday announced the start of their so-called INSTEX scheme, a mechanism to facilitate EU-Iran trade in humanitarian goods not under US sanctions. Trade between Europe and Iran has plummeted since the US imposed a raft of sanctions that have battered Iran's currency and sent its economy into recession. The Islamic Republic’s oil exports to the bloc are down to zero. After the talks on Friday, Abbas Araghchi, Iran's deputy foreign minister, said that Europe was not doing enough and for the INSTEX system to be useful ""Europeans need to buy oil from Iran, or to consider credit lines for this mechanism.""

"a-49433918"|"https://www.dw.com/en/opinion-unnecessary-sea-watch-3-provocations-from-both-sides/a-49433918"|"Bernd Riegert"|"In Germany, the skipper of the NGO-owned migrant rescue ship ""Sea-Watch 3"" is being hailed as a hero by politicians and celebrities alike. Surprisingly, this has included Germany's president, who is typically more likely to criticize domestic politics than international partners. In Italy, though, Carola Rackete is mostly regarded as a criminal. So, which camp is right? The answer probably lies somewhere in the middle. Read more: Migrant rescue vessel Sea-Watch 3: What you need to know Rackete's daredevil docking maneuver, in the course of which she inflicted damage to a police boat, must lead to consequences under criminal law. However, her desire to find a safe haven for her shipwrecked passengers cannot be denied either. Italy's interior minister, Matteo Salvini, called Rackete's unauthorized entering of Lampedusa's port an ""act of war|"" or piracy, claims that aren't compatible with maritime law. But if the broader goal of Sea-Watch, a Berlin-based private aid organization, was to discredit Italy's interior minister and his hardline anti-migration policy, it has failed for the time being. Salvini rejoices Salvini, a cunning populist, gleefully seizes on this provocation, grateful for another opportunity to take his message to Italy's voters, namely that he's completely on the right track when he refuses to take in shipwrecked people. In his twisted world view, Italy has to defend itself against an attack by a German vessel and so-called ""do-gooders"" from northern Europe. DW's Bernd Riegert Both the ship's captain and the NGO's officials should have known, facing an opponent such as Matteo Salvini, that they'd be unable to win this political showdown by staging a provocation. Indirectly, they are even helping the far-right politician to cement his tough, inhumane stance within the EU. Now, the only glimmer of hope is that Italy's judiciary will observe the principle of proportionality and will issue Rackete with a fine at most, rather than sending her to prison. After all, it's not the first time that a ship owned by a private charity has been impounded. Another German ship, the ""Lifeline"", was confiscated by Maltese authorities in June 2018 and remains moored in the port of Valletta. It's not just Italy which has radically revised its stance regarding private migrant rescuers, who were initially hailed by the EU. The overall policy of the EU's member states is now to keep refugees inside Libya, or alternatively to try to have them returned to Libya by the country's coastguard. ""Sophia"", the EU's own rescue mission off the Libyan coast, has been canceled — the focus is on deterrence. Inept EU Defying this European policy of containment are the various private vessels which are still rescuing migrants from inflatable dinghies and trying to take them to Europe. For years, attempts at establishing an EU-wide distribution system which applies in such cases have been torpedoed by the non-Mediterranean countries. In the past, distribution was only successful when one of a handful of countries spontaneously agreed to accept small groups of refugees from single vessels on humanitarian grounds. This impromptu bartering process between the EU's capitals cannot, of course, be a permanent fixture as it's completely incalculable. Five EU countries had offered to take in those migrants who still remained on board ""Sea-Watch 3"", so Salvini could very easily have avoided this whole song and dance. However, being hailed as the defender of Italy's sovereignty is an integral part of his political strategy. Now that those people have disembarked on Lampedusa, Salvini wants to send them on to Germany, France, Finland, Portugal and Luxembourg without establishing their identities first, which flies in the face of European regulations. This approach practically guarantees further trouble, which Salvini could also exploit for his political ends. Who will benefit? There are two lessons to be drawn from the ""Sea-Watch 3"" affair. Firstly, this kind of spectacular protest campaign achieves very little in the matter at hand — on the contrary, radical opponents of migration stand to benefit. Also, the European Union has to agree on a unified system of distribution urgently in order to avoid such face-offs. But given the entrenched divisions within the EU on this topic at present, there is little hope that this will happen in the near future. Not to mention, there's the more fundamental issue of refugees or migrants trying to leave Libya on human traffickers' boats. Their destiny remains largely in the dark, because the EU, having stopped its own rescue mission and amid fewer and fewer private missions like ""Sea-Watch 3"", no longer even knows how many people actually perish while trying to reach European shores. If you're wondering who recently issued this complaint, by the way, it was the UN's High Commissioner for Refugees, Italian diplomat Filippo Grandi."|"The arrest of the ""Sea-Watch 3"" captain raises the question of who stands to benefit from such acts of protest.

During the three huge protests in June against a controversial extradition bill, which would allow extradition of criminal suspects to mainland China, Sarah was once again faced with a dilemma. ""My mother asked me not to go [to the protests] because everyone should only mind their own business. Pursuing money and stability matters to her more than our fight for freedom and democracy|"" Sarah told DW. Read more: Hong Kong pro-democracy movement — going from strength to strength Sarah is one of the many young people in Hong Kong whose political stances are causing tensions within families. According to a survey from the University of Hong Kong in 2016, the younger generation aged between 18 to 39 tend to vote for pro-democracy parties, while the group aged over 40 is more prone to support pro-Beijing outfits. Hong Kong witnessed its largest protest in history this month, with organizers gathering close to 2 million people on the streets, calling for the government to withdraw the contentious legislation. The extradition proposal was widely seen as a move that would erode Hong Kong's autonomy and judicial independence. The territory's Chief Executive Carrie Lam initially said the legislation was needed to close a legal loophole that prevented the extradition of a murder suspect to Taiwan. Sarah is one of the many young people in Hong Kong whose political stances are causing tensions within families After it became clear that the opposition to the bill was widespread, Lam's government suspended debate on the extradition legislation indefinitely. It appears unlikely that the bill will pass during her term, but protesters are demanding it be officially withdrawn. Backlash from the old The political rift between the old and young in Hong Kong was also evident during the city's ""Umbrella Movement"" pro-democracy protests in 2014. At the time, student-led demonstrators occupied parts of Hong Kong demanding a say in the election of the territory's leader — a demand that ultimately failed. The protesters then faced a backlash from the pro-Beijing camp as well as those who condemned the students for causing chaos in society. ""We have a very different mindset. Even when I was in high school, my mother asked me not to join political events. But the younger generation is willing to spend time and effort in pushing for political changes. If not, things will be hopeless|"" said Sarah. Read more: Hong Kong investors face uncertainty as Chinese questions mount The two generations' different attitudes can be attributed to their own experiences with social movements and the perception of China, said Gary Wong, a lecturer in the sociology department at the University of Hong Kong. ""Some of the parents are migrants from mainland China. Their experience with China, where political openness is limited, told them to avoid any participation in social movements and confrontation with the government|"" Wong told DW. The younger ones, however, have a much stronger sense of belonging to Hong Kong, Wong said, adding that they also suffer more from economic stagnation, limited social mobility, poor governance and bad perception of China. The young people are thus more motivated to be engaged in political movements than their parents, Wong underlined.

""The city will sadly be under Beijing's control again."" An avid protester at the recent ""No Extradition to China"" rally, Gina said she had seldom paid attention to Hong Kong politics until the bill made her realize how it would harm the city's legal system and compromise its civil liberties. ""I saw with my own eyes how the police used excessive force on protesters, and even categorized the assembly as a 'riot.' The government ignored citizens' demands for withdrawing the bill|"" Gina told DW. Read more: Joshua Wong: Carrie Lam 'incapable' of leading Hong Kong Gina's mother, who grew up in mainland China before moving to Hong Kong, shared a completely different view. She reckoned that the police had every reason to shoot teargas to disperse protesters and maintain law and order. ""I think people in her age group tend to have this mindset|"" Gina noted. Some old people also believe the rumors that the protest organizers were handing over money to the demonstrators, and that the young were taking to the streets to make money, Gina said. Is there any possibility for the gap between the two generations to diminish? Professor Wong appears skeptical. ""The problem of Hong Kong is the lack of a true democratic system… the chief executive is not elected by the general public, but by a small group of electors in Beijing, so the government is not accountable to the general public of the city. Without universal suffrage, it is hard to see any possible solution to resolve the differences|"" he said. Meanwhile, Gina's 57-year-old mother said that she changed her stance, in support of the protesters, after she understood how the proposed extradition legislation might prove harmful. The names of the people quoted in the article have been changed to protect their identities. Despite official calls to disperse, demonstrators continued to march on Wednesday. They overturned police barriers and stood their ground even when confronted with pepper spray and a threat by police to use force if they continued to oppose their orders. Some protesters left umbrellas on the police barricades, an homage to the ""Occupy Democracy"" movement that began in 2014. The massive, months-long campaign was prompted by constitutional reforms that allowed Beijing to approve candidates for Hong Kong elections. Organizers say that over 1 million people have joined in the demonstrations, which blocked two main highways near government headquarters on Wednesday. Most of the protesters are students and young people. Students were boycotting classes to attend the rallies. Activists have decried the move to allow extradition to China, because of Beijing's poor human rights and legal record. Many in Hong Kong are also upset by the creeping authoritarianism in the city, after they were promised autonomy when the territory was given back to China from the UK in 1997. Thousands of officers, including riot police, have been deployed throughout the city. Over the weekend, demonstrators hurled bottles at security forces and tried to push their way into the parliament building, but were blocked. China has long promised Hong Kong self-rule under the ""one country, two systems"" motto. But for those in the sprawling city, the extradition bill is the latest in a long line of examples of creeping Chinese control."|"Mass protests by Hong Kongers over the past couple of weeks have underlined the yawning gap between the city's old and young.

The European Union pursues a single course, after all. But is it just her course? Her critics in the EU complain about Merkel's power and dominance: Some call her the head of Europe — that is, of course, wrong, formally speaking. When French soldiers march at the Arc de Triomphe, there is no lack of pathos and nationalism. However, the European Union was formed on precisely the idea of overcoming nationalist tendencies and hostilities. For French President Emmanuel Macron, pride in his ""Grande Nation"" and belief in a new European Union are not contradictions. Macron has positioned himself as a fighter for reforms. Perhaps the girl with the pigtails (center) is currently Europe's biggest rock star. The 16-year-old Greta Thunberg from Sweden has triggered a global movement with Skolstrejk for klimatet (school strike for the climate).

But, given the diversity of the EU, the question often arises: Who defines that? On the map, Hungary sits to the right of Brussels, far to the right. The reign of Viktor Orban, Hungary's nationalist prime minister, has proved a source of torment for the EU leaders in Brussels. Orban, however, has had domestic success with his anti-immigrant euroskeptic agenda, and he has several allies throughout the bloc. He is a thorn in side of many of his counterparts throughout the EU. The French national football team in training.

Mbappe is French, his mother comes from Algeria, his father came from Cameroon. Many people in France have diverse multicultural heritage. By 2025 almost 30% of EU citizens will have reached the age of 60. The trend of an aging European Union is already clear in Italy. But what does this demographic change mean? And shouldn't the EU, then, be recruiting its labor force abroad? In Ghana, for example, only 4% of the population is over 65. A man in Bulgaria pauses in prayer. Bordering Turkey and in a region with several culturally or historically Islamic countries, but predominantly Christian Orthodox itself, Bulgaria is the EU member with the highest proportion of Muslims in the population.

However, Dapiran also pointed out that not having a leader could make it difficult for protesters to formulate demands when they have to engage with the government. ""If the government wants to engage with the protesters, they need to have some interlocutors|"" he explained. ""But when a movement is leaderless, who do they talk to?"" A paralyzed government Despite protesters repeatedly coming out on to the streets in record numbers, Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam hasn't agreed to a complete withdrawal of the extradition bill and step down from her position.

Police clear the streets after protesters stormed the Legislative Council building in Hong Kong on July 1 To most protesters, the government's decision to indefinitely suspend the extradition bill does not mean it will not be revived in the future.

Lee believes that the growing suspicion toward the government is one of the reasons why so many people are willing to join the protests.

But the judge overturned the order, saying Rackete was ""doing her duty saving human lives."" ""We are relieved our captain is free|"" Sea-Watch International said in a tweet. ""There were no grounds to keep her arrested, as her only 'wrongdoing' was to enforce human rights on the Mediterranean and to take responsibility where none of the European governments did."" Rackete captained a vessel carrying more than 40 migrants. After weeks at sea, she decided to port in Lampedusa, dismissing a military order banning her vessel from entering Italian territorial waters. While attempting to dock her ship, she rammed into a police boat that was trying to block her maneuvers. Read more: Europe's migrant rescue boats face uncertain future In late 2014, with the war in Syria approaching its fourth year and Islamic State making gains in the north of the country, the exodus of Syrians intensified. At the same time, others were fleeing violence and poverty in countries such as Iraq, Afghanistan, Eritrea, Somalia, Niger and Kosovo. Vast numbers of Syrian refugees had been gathering in border-town camps in neighboring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan since 2011. By 2015, with the camps full to bursting and residents often unable to find work or educate their children, more and more people decided to seek asylum further afield. In 2015 an estimated 1.5 million people made their way on foot from Greece towards western Europe via the ""Balkan route"". The Schengen Agreement, which allows passport-free travel within much of the EU, was called into question as refugees headed towards the wealthier European nations. Tens of thousands of refugees were also attempting the perilous journey across the Mediterranean on overcrowded boats. In April 2015, 800 people of various nationalities drowned when a boat traveling from Libya capsized off the Italian coast. This was to be just one of many similar tragedies - by the end of the year, nearly 4,000 refugees were reported to have died attempting the crossing. Countries along the EU's external border struggled to cope with the sheer number of arrivals. Fences were erected in Hungary, Slovenia, Macedonia and Austria. Asylum laws were tightened and several Schengen area countries introduced temporary border controls. Critics of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's ""open-door"" refugee policy claimed it had made the situation worse by encouraging more people to embark on the dangerous journey to Europe. By September 2016, Germany had also introduced temporary checks on its border with Austria. In early 2016, the EU and Turkey signed an agreement under which refugees arriving in Greece could be sent back to Turkey. The deal has been criticized by human rights groups and came under new strain following a vote by the European Parliament in November to freeze talks on Turkey's potential accession to the EU. With anti-immigration sentiment in Europe growing, governments are still struggling to reach a consensus on how to handle the continuing refugee crisis. Attempts to introduce quotas for the distribution of refugees among EU member states have largely failed. Conflicts in the Middle East and elsewhere show no signs coming to an end, and the death toll from refugee sea crossings is on the rise. Author: Rachel Stewart Trafficking claims Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, who leads the far-right League Party, has threatened to use any means necessary to prevent vessels rescuing migrants off the coast of Libya from entering Italy. He has accused them of human trafficking. But Sicily-based prosecutor Luigi Patronaggio on Tuesday told Italian lawmakers that investigators have yet to find evidence that rescue vessels, such as the Sea-Watch 3, were implicated in a trafficking scheme to funnel migrants to Europe Human rights groups have criticized Salvini's ""repressive management of the migratory phenomenon|"" saying it undermines the EU's core values. Nearly half a million irregular migrants have crossed the central Mediterranean and made landfall in Italy since 2015, according to the International Organization for Migration. Since January 340 migrants have died attempting the dangerous journey. Read more: Follow the money: What are the EU's migration policy priorities?

Local authorities said that improperly stored chicken dung at a farm in rural northeastern Spain spontaneously combusted in the extreme heat on Wednesday, unleashing a wildfire that continued to burn on into Friday.

"a-49440166"|"https://www.dw.com/en/eu-leaders-reconvene-to-resolve-top-jobs-impasse/a-49440166"|""|"European Union leaders gathered in Brussels on Tuesday for a third day of talks after they failed to come to an agreement on the bloc's top jobs during a marathon 18-hour session the day before. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was entering Tuesday's talks with ""new creativity"" and urged other leaders to be more open to compromise. ""I think that everyone understands that they need to move a bit"" in order to achieve a result, she said. Her remarks come after Italy, Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia opposed a possible compromise the day before. The official start of Tuesday's summit was delayed until the afternoon as European Council chairman Donald Tusk continued separate talks with leaders. According to German newspaper Die Welt, Tusk has been pushing a new compromise with leaders that would seen German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen becoming the new European Commission president. Under Tusk's plan, the new head of the European Central Bank would be Christine Lagarde — a proposition that Merkel is reportedly open to. Leaders from the bloc's 28 member-states have been in disagreement for weeks over naming a successor to outgoing European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, who heads the EU's powerful executive arm. Leaders are reportedly discussing having German Defense Minister Ursula Von der Leyen be the next European Commission president Timmermans 'not acceptable' for some EU states Following talks yesterday, Dutch Social Democrat Frans Timmermans was favored to take the top European Commission post. That option didn't sit well with some EU member states, as Timmermans has been a vocal supporter of the refugee quota distribution system and threatened legal action in order to improve rule of law in Hungary and Poland. ""We want somebody on the presidency of the commission who doesn't have a negative view on our region. Mr. Timmermans is not acceptable for us. That's it|"" Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis told reporters as he arrived in Brussels. Timmermans main challenger Manfred Weber, a German EU lawmaker with the center-right European People's Party (EPP), could possibly end up being the speaker of the European Parliament. Going into the talks, Weber had been favored to succeed Juncker, but appears to have slipped in the rankings during negotiations. The center-right European People's Party (EPP) — the largest faction in the European Parliament — has picked Manfred Weber, its German parliamentary party leader. He has the backing of Chancellor Angela Merkel. Though considered the front-runner, Weber is little known on the international stage, and his language skills are considered poor. Frans Timmermans, the European Commission's first vice president, will lead the campaign for the Progressive Alliance of Socialists & Democrats (S&D). Weber's main rival promises to bring the bloc closer to ordinary voters at a time when Britain's looming exit is one factor behind the nationalist movements across the EU. Margrethe Vestager, 51, is one of seven lead candidates for the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats. As the current EU commissioner for competition, the Danish MEP has taken on corporations like Apple, Amazon and Google parent Alphabet. It's also been said that she served as the inspiration for the main character in Borgen, a Danish series where a woman becomes Denmark's first female leader. The third-largest group in the EU Parliament, the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR), has just one candidate: Jan Zahradil, chairman of the Czech ECR delegation. Zahradil, 65, is affectionately known as ""Forrest Gump"" for cycling from Prague to Strasbourg for a session of the European Parliament and for once running 1,300 kilometers (about 800 miles) across the Czech Republic for charity. The Greens/EFA is the seventh largest group in European Parliament, so the German is a long shot to become European Commission president. The Greens have proposed a job share, with two candidates serving for two-and-a-half years each. The most favorite to join Keller is Dutch lawmaker Bas Eickhout. The EU's left-wing groups will be headed by Spanish trade unionist Nico Cue and Violeta Tomic (at left). Tomic is a deputy in Slovenia's National Assembly, best known as a TV presenter and actress. She entered into politics in 2014 and has been an advocate for LGBT rights and stronger citizens' rights in Europe. Cue grew up in Belgium after his family was forced to flee Franco's Soain. Author: Keith Walker European Parliament convenes The talks in Brussels came as the European Parliament opened its first post-election session in Strasbourg on Tuesday. The opening session was disrupted by some newly elected legislators from right-wing parties, Catalan independence supporters and others. Some lawmakers with the Brexit Party were seen turning their backs while the EU's anthem ""Ode to Joy"" was playing. The European Parliament must ratify the top job appointments made by the 28 EU leaders. Lawmakers are due to vote on a new leader for the European Parliament on Wednesday. The new session follows elections in May that saw the bloc's two traditional center-right and center-left parties lose votes, while the Greens and far-right parties saw solid gains.

Rackete remains under house arrest in Italy, though Sea-Watch said she is in good health. ""It is truly, truly shameful|"" spokesperson Ruben Neugebauer told reporters at an emotionally-charged press conference in Berlin on Tuesday, pointing out that Italy had closed its ports to humanitarian rescue vessels a year ago, causing several standoffs with local authorities. ""Since then, the European Union and the German government have had time to find a solution to the situation, but they always find a way to talk themselves out of it|"" he said. ""They're very good at making excuses, pointing the finger at others … and saying 'we need a European solution.'"" He added that a European solution ""would be nice|"" but until there is one, individual countries need to take responsibility.

A Human Rights Watch report from January this year also said that ""EU policies contribute to the abuse of migrants in Libya.""

""This is a continent of more than 500 million people, who for over two weeks cannot manage to distribute 50 refugees across the continent|"" said his colleague Neugebauer. ""It's absurd.

In June, the UK's Guardian newspaper and other media outlets reported that Sea-Watch 3 was the last rescue boat still operating in the Mediterranean.

"a-49443786"|"https://www.dw.com/en/german-theater-brings-david-grossman-novel-to-israeli-stage/a-49443786"|"Sarah Judith Hofmann (cmb)"|"The Israeli author David Grossman had only been speaking to the audience in Tel Aviv-Jaffa for a few minutes when the all-powerful word containing a world of emotions fell from his lips: Holocaust. He was talking following a stage performance of his 2008 novel To the End of the Land (translated from Hebrew into English by Jessica Cohen in 2010) that was presented at the Gesher Theater on Sunday as part of the Jaffa International Theater Festival. The production by the Schauspiel Frankfurt theater, with support from the Goethe Institute, was presented in German with Hebrew subtitles. The head dramaturge of the Schauspiel Frankfurt, Marion Tiedtke, said the entire production team was very anxious about presenting the show on an Israeli stage. Germans have a strong connection to the state of Israel due to the horrific shared history of the Holocaust, she said, adding that the team wanted to avoid any missteps. The 65-year-old Grossman, one of Israel's most important contemporary authors and outspoken peace activists who won the 2017 Man Booker International Prize, says the Frankfurt theater's decision to have four different actors portray the novel's protagonist, Ora, first astonished him, then fascinated him. Grossman and translator Cohen received the Man Booker International Prize in 2017 for the English translation of ""A Horse Walks into a Bar"" — which he shared with translator Jessica Cohen War flashbacks Grossman's novel, however, does not focus on the murder of six million Jews by the Nazis during the Holocaust. Rather, it tells the story of a love triangle between Ora and her two best friends, Ilan and Avram, during the 1973 Arab-Israeli War. Known also as the Yom Kippur War, the conflict sees Avram captured by the Egyptians and then tortured for many years. His best friend Ilan is plagued endlessly by self-reproach: Why was he spared the prisoner's fate that Avram was dealt? Why is he, and not Avram, allowed to live with Ora and raise two children with her? The novel, which Grossman wrote over more than ten years, explores these questions through flashbacks. The surrounding framework is just as dramatic and political: Taking place some 20 years after the Yom Kippur War, it centers on the elderly Ora. When her younger son, Ofer, revealed as the child of Avram, is pulled into a new ""operation"" following the end of his military service, she decides to flee. Ora wanders through the mountains of Galilee in northern Israel, making herself unreachable to avoid the message she fears: that Ofer has been killed in combat. With her is ex-lover Avram, who was allowed to return to Israel after years in Egyptian prison. He is seriously injured and traumatized, and it becomes clear to Ora that he is a broken man. Schauspiel Frankfurt presented the performance of ""To the End of the Land"" in German with Hebrew subtitles Grossman's own lost son Ora has been interpreted to be Grossman's alter ego. Just like the novel's protagonist Ofer, his son Uri was a tank commander and took part in one of the last offensives of 2006 Lebanon War while Grossman was writing the novel. As the work neared completion, Uri was killed when his tank was hit by a missile launched by Hezbollah fighters. Upon publication, the novel became a worldwide success, praised by critics and readers for its emotional nuance. Through the perspective of a mother fearing for her solider son, Grossman sharply criticized the politics of his country, including Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories. But such criticism, expressed by an Israeli who simultaneously and consistently voices love for his country, sounds different when expressed by a German. The Schauspiel Frankfurt team was aware of this situation, recently manifested by the German parliament's decision to define as anti-Semitic the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement, which protests Israeli policy towards Palestinians. According to the Old Testament, David, king of the two partial kingdoms of Judah and Israel, won Jerusalem from the Jebusites around 1000 BC. He moved his seat of government to Jerusalem, making it the capital and religious center of his kingdom. The Bible says David's son Solomon built the first temple for Yahweh, the God of Israel. Jerusalem became the center of Judaism. The Neo-Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar II (3rd from the left) conquered Jerusalem in 597 and again in 586 BC, as the Bible says. He took King Jehoiakim (5th from the right) and the Jewish upper class into captivity, sent them to Babylon and destroyed the temple. After Persian king Cyrus the Great seized Babylon, he allowed the exiled Jews to return home to Jerusalem and to rebuild their temple. The Roman Empire ruled Jerusalem from the year 63 AD. Resistance movements rapidly formed among the population, so that in 66 AD, the First Jewish–Roman War broke out. The war ended 4 years later, with a Roman victory and another destruction of the temple in Jerusalem. The Romans and Byzantines ruled Palestine for approximately 600 years. Over the course of the Islamic conquest of Greater Syria, Muslim armies also reached Palestine. By order of the Caliph Umar (in the picture), Jerusalem was besieged and captured in the year 637 AD. In the following era of Muslim rule, various, mutually hostile and religiously divided rulers presided over the city. Jerusalem was often besieged and changed hands several times. From 1070 AD onward, the Muslim Seljuk rulers increasingly threatened the Christian world. Pope Urban II called for the First Crusade, which took Jerusalem in 1099 AD. Over a period of 200 years a total of nine crusades set out to conquer the city as it changed hands between Muslim and Christian rule. In 1244 AD the crusaders finally lost control of the city and it once again became Muslim. After the conquest of Egypt and Arabia by the Ottomans, Jerusalem became the seat of an Ottoman administrative district in 1535 AD. In its first decades of Ottoman rule, the city saw a clear revival. With a British victory over Ottoman troops in 1917 AD, Palestine fell under British rule. Jerusalem went to the British without a fight. After World War II, the British gave up their Palestinian Mandate. The UN voted for a division of the country in order to create a home for the survivors of the Holocaust. Some Arab states then went to war against Israel and conquered part of Jerusalem. Until 1967, the city was divided into an Israeli west and a Jordanian east. In 1967, Israel waged the Six-Day War against Egypt, Jordan and Syria. Israel took control of the Sinai, the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem. Israeli paratroopers gained access to the Old City and stood at the Wailing Wall for the first time since 1949. East Jerusalem is not officially annexed, but rather integrated into the administration. Israel has not denied Muslims access to its holy places. The Temple Mount is under an autonomous Muslim administration; Muslims can enter, visit the Dome of the Rock and the adjacent Al-Aqsa mosque and pray there. Jerusalem remains to this day an obstacle to peace between Israel and Palestine. In 1980, Israel declared the whole city its ""eternal and indivisible capital."" After Jordan gave up its claim to the West Bank and East Jerusalem in 1988, the state of Palestine was proclaimed. Palestine also declares, in theory, Jerusalem as its capital. Author: Ines Eisele ""We in Germany must deal with the sensitive situation that on the one hand, guilt towards Jews and also Israel will never go away|"" Tiedtke told DW. ""On the other hand, there are universal human rights that include the right to a homeland [recognized by some legal scholars on basis of international treaties: Ed.] and this is difficult for us Germans."" Tiedtke admitted there is a risk in staging such political content, but she believes that theater is there to provide a forum for important social topics, including those that are sensitive and controversial. Read more: Israel bans novel on Arab-Jewish love story A German staging of an Israeli experience That was the question of the evening: How does a German theater stage material that is deeply Israeli? A story full of the trauma of war, fear of annihilation and the loss of a nation from which a people were exiled for millennia? Yet simultaneously a story that criticizes this same state of Israel, which is itself has become a problematic actor at the center of the Middle East conflict? There was no heated discussion in the Gesher Theater on Sunday. The Schauspiel Frankfurt's production of To the End of the Land was well-received by the public. Grossman, one of Israel's most outspoken peace activists who has received international accolades including the German book trade Peace Prize, also remained silent on the subject of current Israeli, and global, politics. He wanted to let the performance simply sink in, he said. Marion Tiedtke was one of the panel participents in the discussion after the performance of ""To the End of the Land"" Tiedtke said the theater group felt ashamed to present Israelis with a story about their own country. ""The living situation in Israel is one that we today in Germany don't known, because of more than 70 years of peace|"" Tiedtke said in reference to the potential for conflict to flare up in Israel. German language connection But Altine Emili, one of the actors portraying Ora, is no stranger to war. She was born in Kosovo and at age five fled Serbian troops with her family to Germany. ""I have another point of access|"" Emili said after the performance. ""I feel it emotionally and can't play it down with technique."" She feared her onstage performance would injure someone, she said, for she knows what it means when trauma is reawakened. In contrast, speaking German, the language of the perpetrators of the Holocaust, on an Israeli stage was not an issue for her. Her boyfriend is Israeli and has been living in Germany for three years. She speaks German with him. The situation was different for Tiedtke, in Israel for the first time. She happily noticed how many German-speaking audience members were at the performance: ""That really touched me, because it shows that despite this terrible shared history, the language is a point of connection."" United Nations Security Council Resolution 242, passed on November 22, 1967, called for the exchange of land for peace. Since then, many of the attempts to establish peace in the region have referred to 242. The resolution was written in accordance with Chapter VI of the UN Charter, under which resolutions are recommendations, not orders. A coalition of Arab states, led by Egypt and Syria, fought Israel in the Yom Kippur or October War in October 1973. The conflict eventually led to the secret peace talks that yielded two agreements after 12 days. This picture from March 26, 1979, shows Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, his US counterpart Jimmy Carter and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin after signing the accords in Washington. The US and the former Soviet Union came together to organize a conference in the Spanish capital city of Madrid. The discussions involved Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and Palestinians — not from the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) — who met with Israeli negotiators for the first time. While the conference achieved little, it did create the framework for later, more productive talks. The negotiations in Norway between Israel and the PLO, the first direct meeting between the two parties, resulted in the the Oslo I Accord. The agreement was signed in the US in September 1993. It demanded that Israeli troops withdraw from West Bank and Gaza and a self-governing, interim Palestinian authority be set up for a five-year transitional period. A second accord was signed in 1995. US President Bill Clinton invited Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat to the retreat in July 2000 to discuss borders, security, settlements, refugees and Jerusalem. Despite the negotiations being more detailed than ever before, no agreement was concluded. The failure to reach a consensus at Camp David was followed by renewed Palestinian uprising, the Second Intifada. The Camp David negotiations were followed first by meetings in Washington and then in Cairo and Taba, Egypt — all without results. Later the Arab League proposed the Arab Peace Initiative in Beirut in March 2002. The plan called on Israel to withdraw to pre-1967 borders so that a Palestinian state could be set up in the West Bank and Gaza. In return, Arab countries would agree to recognize Israel. The US, EU, Russia and the UN worked together as the Middle East Quartet to develop a road map to peace. While Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas accepted the text, his Israeli counterpart Ariel Sharon had more reservations with the wording. The timetable called for a final agreement on a two-state solution to be reached in 2005. Unfortunately, it was never implemented. In 2007 US President George W. Bush hosted a conference in Annapolis, Maryland, to relaunch the peace process. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas took part in talks with officials from the Quartet and over a dozen Arab states. It was agreed that further negotiations would be held with the goal of reaching a peace deal by the end of 2008. In 2010, US Middle East Envoy George Mitchell convinced Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to and implement a ten-month moratorium on settlements in disputed territories. Later, Netanyahu and Abbas agreed to relaunch direct negotiations to resolve all issues. Negotiations began in Washington in September 2010, but within weeks there was a deadlock. A new round of violence broke out in and around Gaza late 2012. A ceasefire was reached between Israel and those in power in the Gaza Strip, which held until June 2014. The kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June 2014 resulted in renewed violence and eventually led to the Israeli military operation Protective Edge. It ended with a ceasefire on August 26, 2014. Envoys from over 70 countries gathered in Paris, France, to discuss the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. Netanyahu slammed the discussions as ""rigged"" against his country. Neither Israeli nor Palestinian representatives attended the summit. ""A two-state solution is the only possible one|"" French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said at the opening of the event. Despite the year's optimistic opening, 2017 brought further stagnation in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. A deadly summer attack on Israeli police at the Temple Mount, a site holy to both Jews and Muslims, sparked deadly clashes. Then US President Donald Trump's plan to move the embassy to Jerusalem prompted Palestinian leader Abbas to say ""the measures ... undermine all peace efforts.""

Brian Griffey: What we have found is that the central human rights violation from American authorities has been the targeting for unlawful restrictions of people defending migrants' rights, based on their political opinions. This includes warrantless surveillance and seizures of information and electronic devices. It's highly concerning to see that these individuals, who put themselves between the abuse of government officials and the people who are having their rights violated, become themselves the new primary target for human rights violations. We've seen it in war zones all over the world, we've seen it in authoritarian states and now we're seeing it on the US-Mexican border. The contempt that US authorities are showing for lawyers, journalists, activists and humanitarian volunteers is not just a contempt for those individuals, it's a contempt for the rule of law, a contempt for the judiciary and a contempt for the constitutional guarantee for freedom of speech. Read more: Migrant children relocated as US Border Agency commissioner resigns How have US authorities reacted when you contacted them for your report? We engaged the Departments of State, Justice and Homeland Security and none of them have answered our questions. What we have put together is a very damning portrait of what they've done and we're expecting that the US government will now try to target any weaknesses in our report. But we've been giving them the opportunity to comment on our concerns for over four months and they've basically been giving us the silent treatment and tried to make us go away by ignoring the problem. Brian Griffey is the author of the report 'Saving lives is not a crime' about human rights defenders at the US-Mexico border In the opening section of your report you quote a 2017 statement from the US State Department emphasizing how important the protection of human rights defenders around the world is. How does that match with current actions? That section of State Department policy is deeply ironic because it condemns the very type of politically motivated human rights violations that the US itself is now conducting on the US-Mexican border. The Department of State is giving awards to human rights defenders who are under threat in foreign countries while at the same time damning human rights defenders in their own territory. I just got back from a month-long mission along the US-Mexican border and saw again and again that US and Mexican authorities were overwhelmed and were not providing fundamental lodging, food and medical services to these incredibly vulnerable migrants and asylum seekers. And where the governments can't accommodate these people, it's been the border communities and human rights defenders who have stepped up and cared for them. It's alarming to say the least that not only are the US and Mexican governments failing in their protection of vulnerable migrants, they are also now targeting the people who stepped up and are doing the governments' work. A large wall stretches into the Pacific Ocean at the beaches of San Diego and Tijuana, two populous cities separated by the US-Mexico border. It is one of the most secure areas of the frontier and is part of the 700 miles (1,126 kilometers) of fencing that have been completed thus far. The fight over how to secure the border has divided Republicans, who support more fencing, and Democrats, who argue that using technology is more effective. Experts estimate it would cost $15-25 billion (€13-22 billion) to fully wall off the entire southern frontier. Large swaths of the border are covered in desert, desolate and uninhabited. Many migrants try to cross these areas, where they fall victim to disorientation, dehydration and where the risk of death is high. Activists often leave water (pictured) and other supplies to help migrants survive the dangerous trek. Roughly 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) of the 1,933-mile border are covered by the snaking Rio Grande. Migrants regularly attempt to cross the river, either by swimming or on rafts. The calm appearance of the Rio Grande is deceitful, as it is a fast-moving river with dangerous currents. The US-Mexico border is considered the most transited frontier in the world. Most of the movement takes place at the various points of entry, where lawful back-and-forth traffic and asylum-seekers meet. The Matamoros-Brownsville International Bridge (pictured) is one of 44 official points of entry and the last one before the border ends at the Gulf of Mexico. Author: Jenipher Camino Gonzalez Can you give us an example of what human rights defenders have experienced at the border? The case of Ana Adlerstein [a volunteer from Arizona] is a really good example. She was informing asylum seekers on the Mexican side of the border about their legal rights for seeking asylum protection in the United States. When she was returning, she accompanied an asylum seeker to the border to make sure they got through the port of entry. She didn't go with the person immediately, but after a certain amount of time of their being questioned, she went up to the border crossing to make sure things were ok. That's when the officer in charge said she was aiding and abetting human smuggling and told Adlerstein she was under arrest. This set off what became hours of detention where she had her shoes taken away, had an invasive body search and was held for several hours in what was essentially a jail cell at the border. After intimidating and harassing her, when she said that she needed medical assistance, that she had a headache and was dehydrated, they said they would have to order an ambulance. But when she asked them to do so, they opened the door and released her. They said she was actually not at all arrested, and had only been the subject of a ""secondary inspection"" all along. These ""secondary inspections"" are what we are seeing more and more of.

Fundamentally, this is a rule of law crisis. Congress should exercise its important role in challenging this misuse of the criminal justice system. They should hold public hearings on the apparently politically motivated operations against these human rights defenders in the US-Mexican border region. And through those hearings, Congress should increase its oversight of the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, and of the Trump administration in general. More broadly, I think Congress has an important role to amend criminal laws about ""human smuggling"" to include a humanitarian exemption clause that bars prosecution for humanitarian assistance or other support where there's no financial benefit and no exploitation occurring. Good Samaritans should not be prosecuted for helping other people. Obviously the most immediate thing that needs to happen is that the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, as well as the Trump administration as a whole, need to stop intimidating and harassing human rights defenders who are providing life-saving assistance to people in need.

Now we're meeting in the government buildings. Back then, you called Moldova a ""captured state."" What kind of country is it today? Maia Sandu: We are in the process of liberating this captured state. The servants of the Plahotniuc regime are leaving, one after the other. (Editor's note: Former Prime Minister Vladimir Plahotniuc gave up his post in the middle of June. For several days prior to this, he and his PDM party refused to recognize Moldova's new government — a mixture of Sandu's pro-European ACUM alliance and the pro-Russian socialists.) But we're also aware that there are some institutions still under the old regime's control. We are completely determined to muck out the state. Plahotnius eventually gave up his post and fled the country. Why was he allowed to leave? We still need to find that out. We only learned that he had left the country after the public announcement from his PDM party saying that they would recognize the new government. So far, the relevant institutions have not been able to offer any clear information on how Plahotniuc was able to leave the country. But it is clear that he was able to use his influence on certain institutions to ensure that no traces were left behind. Send Facebook Twitter google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/3L95L There are also concerns internationally that the temporary cooperation between your ACUM alliance and the pro-Russian PSRM socialists could breathe new life into Russia's federalization proposals for the Republic of Moldova. [Editor's note: the separatist, pro-Russian Transnistria region unilaterally declared independence from Moldova in the 1990s and does not recognize the government in Chisinau. This, in particular, makes Moldova's relationship with Russia controversial.] Do you expect ties to Russia to deepen? There can be no federalization process as long as we in the ACUM are quite clearly against it. When it comes to Russia: Moscow's involvement in removing Plahotniuc from political life came as a surprise to us, too. The agreement we signed with the PSRM is the only deal we've made and it's available for all to see. We will have to see how far this cooperation can go. At the moment, both sides are honoring their promises. Read more: Opinion: Moldovan crisis a test case for Russia-US cooperation Before the parliamentary elections in February, you assured voters that you would not work with the PSRM. Is this coalition government, therefore, a betrayal of ACUM voters? We had to make a decision: Either we let the regime stay in power, and risk losing any trace of a democratic process in this country, or we reach an accord with the socialists. Yes, six months ago, this cooperation would have been unacceptable to us, but the final decision was taken after consulting members of the party, and even our voters. We spent a long time looking for better solutions but had to recognize after three months that none existed. Unusually, the EU, Russia and the US all agreed: they all wanted Plahotniuc to give up power. Why do you believe that he and his party suddenly found themselves without any real support from abroad? I think that his deeds and his decisions were so bad in recent months that international powers which very rarely cooperate could band together in opposition to him — at least in our region. Plahotniuc and all his lobbyists could no longer hide the extent of his abuse of power. I was also told in Brussels once that Plahotniuc was seen as the Republic of Moldova's biggest problem. Discussions there often asserted that as long as he stayed, nothing good would happen in Moldova, there would be no positive prospects. Maia Sandu's offices are rather grander than the previous set DW's Vitalie Calugareanu visited Read more: Moldova's oligarch-in-chief has fled, will Europe's poorest country remain a 'captured' state? Do you not find it strange that many shady individuals from your country, who have found refuge in Russia since the 1990s, are now saying: 'It's good that we're rid of Plahotniuc, now we'd like to return home'? It perturbs me greatly, and it's important that we rid the public prosecution of vulnerable or corrupt members as quickly as possible. At the very top, we need an attorney general who makes a start on reforms and has a clear message: In the Republic of Moldova, criminals will be punished. Recently, shocking details have come to light of illegal activity at customs offices and also in the interior ministry. The new deputy PM and interior minister, your party colleague Andre Nastase, spoke of more than 100 ministry employees receiving bribes during Plahotniuc and the oligarchs' tenure. Are you aware that one of the ministries in your control had effectively turned into a criminal group? That doesn't surprise me all that much and I think that there are other institutions where ugly things have happened. For instance, there are state-owned companies which until recently financed Plahotniuc's businesses. Now we are in the middle of this ""mucking-out"" process — but that's not easy with a compromised law enforcement system. Attorney General Eduard Harunjen has said that he will not voluntarily vacate his post. How do you plan to proceed? If he won't go, we will take legislative steps. We will create in law an opportunity for the attorney general to answer for his acts and his failures. And there were rather a lot of failures: for instance in the case of the theft of billions from Moldovan banks [in 2014], when absolutely nothing happened. Everything was simply delayed over and over until the money was as far as possible from the Republic of Moldova. A few days ago I met with representatives of international organizations to talk about this: They told me that our attorney general never asked them for help investigating this theft of billions.

""Sea rescue is a longstanding humanitarian imperative. It's also an obligation under international law."" The captain of the Sea-Watch 3 was put under house arrest at the weekend after she forced her vessel into the Italian port of Lampedusa, citing the welfare of a number of refugees she had rescued. Dujarric, the spokesperson for Secretary General Antonio Gutteres, said that the UN was ""concerned by the recent decree from the government regarding NGO vessels."" She was referring to Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini's successful implementation of legislation to fine ships that flout orders to stay out of Italian waters. The range of fines varies from €10,000 to €50,000 ($11,360 to $56,800). There is also the possibility of criminal action against the crew, as well as the confiscation of the vessel.

It has been 50 years since we last had a German leading the European Commission, and if confirmed, Merkel ally and fellow conservative Ursula von der Leyen would be the first woman in history to take the job. If the German chancellor had been pushing for this outcome, it probably would not have happened. But it was a solution born of necessity, after all other options failed and the heads of EU governments were simply relieved to find a candidate they could agree on. It was French President Emmanuel Macron who jumped in to help Angela Merkel and threw von der Leyen's name in the race. What failed, however, was the EU parliament itself and its system of nominating lead candidates from every major political bloc for the top job. Divisions run deeper than ever If there was one thing completely lacking at this summit, it was the spirit of compromise. And that was mostly the doing of the Visegrad states (Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia). They were more vocal than ever and did everything to sink the bid by Frans Timmermans, the lead candidate for the social democrats. The Dutch politician is currently serving as the EU commissioner in charge of the rule of law. However, he has been a bit too committed for the Visegrad states' liking and has often prosecuted them for their transgressions. Ursula von der Leyen's nomination must be approved by the European Parliament This was unforgivable in the eyes of the nationalists ruling in Warsaw and Budapest, who were also reinforced by the populist government in Rome. This new constellation of power is bound to cause many more headaches in the EU. Now, you may well grit your teeth in anger that a straight-up democrat like Timmermans could fail due to resistance from Viktor Orban and Poland's PiS party. But the days-long discussion in the EU Council is a taste of things to come: there will be more arguments and disagreement. Some eastern and central European countries want a fundamentally different policy. They oppose the model of liberal democracy and are also against EU states growing closer together. And now there are enough troublemakers to persistently undermine and question the decisions of the EU. Backroom deal However, it was Emmanuel Macron who was ultimately responsible for the failure of the conservative front-runner Manfred Weber. Early on, the French president hinted at his belief that Weber lacked experience. Macron was attempting to break the 50-year predominance of the conservative bloc in the EU Commission. He even managed to bring Spain and the Scandinavian countries over to his side. Ultimately, Macron's push also failed, but he was still willing to compromise and accept the German defense minister. It was the Italians who sank the third lead candidate, Margrethe Vestager from the EU-wide liberal bloc Renew Europe. The Danish-born Vestager is a well respected EU Commissioner for Competition. She once got on the wrong side of the government in Rome over a banking row. Rome's opposition showed that haggling over top positions in Brussels also serves to settle individual scores. It also destroyed the last chance to have one of the nominated lead candidates as the head of the commission. Open your eyes when choosing top candidates This whole spectacle was a true disaster for the EU parliament. The lawmakers wanted to make choosing the European Commission head more democratic, more understandable to citizens. The EU leader was to be selected from the small pool of lead candidates from major political blocs in the EU parliament. This is still just a crutch, because candidates are divided by their nationality and voters cannot really do much to show what they think about a candidate from a different country. But it would at least be a first step. Read more: EU election candidates face off in TV debate The German chancellor attempted to salvage the matter and initially supported the moderate leftist bloc. But after all top candidates failed to garner support, there was only one solution — a candidate nobody saw coming. The problem here is the institutional weakness of the EU parliament, because it's the EU governments who name the candidates, and then the deputies vote for them. This means that both sides need to be in agreement. The lesson from this fiasco is to keep your eyes open when picking a top candidate for a political bloc. Manfred Weber was a weak candidate, he had no experience in government. The conservative bloc could have picked a different person. But Weber was still accepted due to faction discipline and long-running alliances. This is not enough. The parties need to think about which candidates can secure a majority, both in their bloc and among the nations deciding on top jobs. They could not even secure a majority for their own candidate in their own ranks. This makes them complicit in this failure, which has set back the democratization of EU policy for years."|"The nomination of Ursula von der Leyen for European Commission president is a victory for Angela Merkel, but a blow to the EU parliament.

Major obstacles Economic experts say the AU still faces significant challenges in implementing the deal. Poor roads and railway lines, violence-hit areas, strict border controls and rampant corruption are some of the obstacles to an effective continental free-trade zone.

It could be doubled in the long term if other issues were dealt with, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). ""Reducing tariffs alone is not sufficient|"" it said. ""It will be important to address those disparities to ensure that special and differential treatments for the least developed countries are adopted and successfully implemented|"" said Landry Signe, a fellow at the Brookings Institution's Africa Growth Initiative. The IMF said in a May report that the AfCFTA could be an ""economic game changer"" for Africa – of a similar kind to the one that boosted growth in Europe and North America. Amaka Anku, Africa analyst at Eurasia group, said the deal was a positive step but AfCFTA was still ""a long way from taking off.""

"a-49513741"|"https://www.dw.com/en/my-europe-balkan-countries-joining-the-eu-unwanted-or-unwilling/a-49513741"|"Ivaylo Ditchev"|"Once it became clear that Recep Tayyip Erdogan's Turkey was not welcome in the EU, and that bringing Ukraine into the fold would create serious tensions with Russia, accession talks concentrated on the Western Balkans instead. Two countries (Albania and North Macedonia) have been formally recognized as candidates, two more (Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo) are potential candidates, while another pair (Serbia and Montenegro) have already started accession negotiations. But alas, the EU's enlargement aims are not what they used to be. Some leaders recall the issues created by other ""problem children"" from the region like Bulgaria, Greece or Romania; other more populist leaders oppose in principle the membership of predominantly Muslim countries like Kosovo and Bosnia; while a few simply tend to forget about the ""soft belly of Europe."" Read more: North Macedonia and Greece: What's in a compromise? Putting the much-discussed enlargement fatigue in Europe to one side, how serious is this region in its stated wish to join the EU? Future held hostage by history Consider a recent example pertaining to relations between Bulgaria and North Macedonia. The government in Sofia presents itself as a champion of the Western Balkans; and yet a tiny incident made the nationalist deputy prime minister and defense minister, Krasimir Karakachanov, threaten to veto North Macedonia's EU accession. His reason? Skopje's government would not acknowledge that Gotse Delchev, one of their venerated revolutionaries from the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, was Bulgarian. A joint commission is supposed to resolve such historical quarrels. But this body only plays for time and after a year it has barely digested disputes from the Middle Ages. Ivaylo Ditchev is a professor of cultural anthropology in Sofia Gotse was born an ethnic Bulgarian and died as a hero of the emerging Macedonian nation, but history is of a lesser importance in this case. What's set to become a major stumbling block in an EU accession process? Not trade, not cross-border projects, not investment or security issues, but rather the ownership of a historical personality. This illustrates that there are reasons why the capitals of Skopje and Sofia, separated by just 245 kilometers (152 miles), are not connected by railway lines to this day! During the dispute, Bulgarian nationalists lauded the heroic Greeks, saying that they had protected their national interest by forcing Skopje to change its country's name and give up all claims on antiquity. This symbolic conflict, which held up the small post-Yugoslav country for 27 years on its road to international recognition, seems to have set an example for the region. Compatible with the European project? The problems are even greater elsewhere. There is real apartheid in Bosnia. The three main ethnic communities [Bosniaks of Muslim descent, primarily Orthodox Serbs and primarily Catholic Croats — editor's note] hardly mix; children even have different history lessons in school. Or consider the difficult talks between Serbia and Kosovo, which were put on ice once again last year after the murder of a Serbian politician. With due respect to the cultural complications, one might still ask what image of the European Union these countries have. At its origin, it was a project designed to overcome borders and foster trans-national cooperation — first in economic projects and later in many more domains. But in the Balkans, EU integration seems to have the opposite goal: It's a tool for not-quite-legitimate local elites to consolidate their power. For them, opposing their neighboring countries has been a way to compensate for the domestic lack of traditional class identity, consistent ideologies or independent policies. In keeping with this tradition, EU integration in the region doesn't start with collaborative coal and steel projects, but with imitative top-down projects required by the modern EU. The Balkan elites have no real interest in doing away with national borders. On the contrary, most businesses rely on national support and covert protectionism. Few local companies actually operate across the region, and relying on multinational companies like Coca-Cola would be naive. Read more: Turkish delights in Montenegro entice entrepreneurs It's always been odd at first glance that former Soviet satellites Bulgaria and Romania joined the EU before the remnants of the non-aligned former Yugoslavia. One explanation might be the fact that the elites in Sofia and Bucharest entered into the transition period with far less legitimacy and had to comply, as they were conditioned to as part of the Soviet bloc. Meanwhile the new states born out of Yugoslavia seemed to retain more self-confidence and internal prestige, leading them not to symbolic wars but to real ones. Ethnic cleansing has happened across the Balkans since the days of the Ottoman Empire Views on ethnicity skewed by conflict The paradoxical use of EU integration to consolidate shaky nation states should be seen in combination with the ethnic vision of the nation that is common in Europe's south-east. Ethnic cleansing, though best known as the trademark of the ""Butcher of the Balkans|"" Slobodan Milosevic, was in fact practiced by every single country in the region. It started with the wars of liberation, in the latter decades of the Ottoman Empire, when hundreds of thousands of Turks were chased from their homes in Greece or Bulgaria. Ethnic cleansing was even done by the supposed ""good guys"" too: for instance when the Croats cleansed the province of Krajina with American help as part of Operation Storm. And in Kosovo, ethnic Serbs are still fleeing the country, right under the distracted nose of the EU. Read more: Hero worship and villain worship in the Balkans Remember what happened in Czechoslovakia and Poland after World War II? They expelled millions of Germans and, given that the Nazis had already exterminated most of the region's Jews, then entered into the postwar world in a state of almost unnatural ethnic homogeneity. The hysterical reaction against refugees at present might be the result of that same feeling of ""purity."" And rooted in this same feeling is a fear of the European project as such, which foresees ethnic boundaries disappearing, people mixing and accepting human diversity. The Western Balkans now risk following the same path, because ethnic-led politics tends to produce strong passions and violent leaders. Perhaps their best hope is to revive the old Yugoslav spirit of openness and a mix of cultures, or even — why not? — the short-lived postwar utopia of a Balkan federation, so rapidly ruined by Josef Stalin. Ivaylo Ditchev is a professor of cultural anthropology at the University of Sofia in Bulgaria. He has lectured in Germany, France and the US, among other places."|"How serious are the Western Balkans in their stated wish to join the European Union?

"a-49515387"|"https://www.dw.com/en/opinion-africas-new-free-trade-zone-is-still-just-a-dream/a-49515387"|"Claus Stäcker"|"A friend of mine from Zimbabwe recently bought a used car. After saving up enough money, he took advantage of a window of stable internet to browse and compare different models online. He checked mileage, trunk size and fuel efficiency, then he finally placed an order — but not in Zimbabwe, nor even in neighboring South Africa, which has an established auto industry and a large used car market. His dream car was in Japan, and the dealer in Yokohama quickly prepared the freight paperwork. Read more: Africa's vision for the future – much more than a free trade deal Soon to be the world's largest free trade zone A broker made sure the car landed in South Africa's largest port, Durban, a few weeks later. To save on further shipping costs, my friend took a two-day bus to Durban. After picking up the car, he drove the 1,700 kilometers (1,000 miles) back home. He had to pay a few extra dollars to get the car's paperwork processed, because it was all in Japanese. He also had to navigate his way through several road checkpoints. Ultimately, he made it home — satisfied that, despite a few hiccups and extra red tape, he had still saved $800 (€713). This is what doing business is like in the South African Development Community (SADC) trade zone. Claus Stäcker heads DW's Africa section The SADC is one of five subregions that will form the new African Free Trade Area, known by the cumbersome acronym AfCFTA. The African Union hailed the new trade zone as an historic achievement during an event in Niger on Sunday marking its launch. The bloc was given a boost after Nigeria, which boasts Africa's largest economy, agreed to sign on. The AfCFTA, which the African Union says will be the world's largest free trade area, has now been created — at least on paper. Eritrea is the only country in Africa not participating. Everyone wants to make rapid social and economic progress in Africa a reality, particularly as refugees leaving the continent continue to endure tragedy in the Sahara and on the Mediterranean Sea. But it remains to be seen whether the AfCFTA can help make that dream a reality. After all, African trade dreams aren't new: As early as 1980, the African Union's predecessor, the Organization for African Unity, agreed on a plan for greater economic integration on the continent. The Lagos Plan of Action, as it was known, not only provided for free trade, but even a common currency. Under Agenda 2063, the African Union's master plan to speed up development and economic growth, 14 major initiatives have been agreed in addition to free trade — including linking the continent's 54 national capitals by express trains. But at the moment, many places in Africa lack adequate energy, transportation and telecommunications infrastructure. At the borders, trucks line up for days on end. It is easier to get from Africa to Europe by plane than between many countries on the continent. Meanwhile, governments in Africa mistrust each other so much that they don't even recognize the African standard passport. Read more: Niger's migrant smugglers use ever deadlier routes through the Sahara Domestic African trade negligible At just shy of 2.5%, Africa's share of world trade has remained unchanged for the past 20 years. Its continental economic power is less than half the size of Japan's. Economic growth has recently shrunk to 3% and is still primarily based on foreign trade in oil, gold, diamonds, precious metals and cocoa. Intra-African trade in goods accounts for just 12% of trade volume. This is where the greatest potential lies, because many products would be much more competitive within Africa than on the global trade market. According to the Economic Commission for Africa, however, transport costs on the continent are the highest in the world. Moving a freight container from Tokyo to the Ivorian capital of Abidjan costs roughly €1,300, while intra-African transport from Addis Ababa in Ethiopia to Abidjan costs €4,500 — more than three times as much. The fact that a Zimbabwean would rather order a used car in Japan than buy a VW, Nissan or BMW built in Africa is proof of the current predicament. African leaders may have celebrated their agreement in Niger, but its the concrete political steps they take that will show whether the AfCFTA is truly historic.

At the last meeting, our side was ready to take everything down in the space of a day. We did everything we could to make that happen.

Read more: How Volodymyr Zelenskiy beat Petro Poroshenko in Ukraine Fighting between pro-Russian separatists and the Ukrainian army has intensified around the cities of Luhansk and Donetsk. The situation for the local population keeps getting worse, the UN Human Rights Commission finds. It especially accuses the pro-Russian separatists of severe crimes. More than 1,100 people have been killed in the fighting since mid-April, according to the UN. Not just armed fighters, but also countless civilians, among them many children, have lost their lives. These people grieve for a father and his little son who died in artillery fire near Luhansk. Civilians often get caught in the crossfire, according to the UN. Heavy weaponry is being employed in densely populated areas not just by the separatists, like here in Donetsk, but also by the Ukrainian army. The United Nations urge all sides to exercise better measures of precaution to protect civilians’ lives. The report accuses the pro-Russian separatists of abducting, torturing and executing people. The separatists are ""rough and brutal"" as well as ""well-equipped and organized"" and often under the command of Russian nationals, according to the UN Human Rights Commission. The UN body has 39 observers on the ground and has documented more than 800 cases of abductions by separatists since mid-April. More than 100,000 people have had to leave their homes. Many live in emergency shelters, like here in Kharkiv, to escape the terror of the separatists and the fighting. There are also reports about Russian-speaking residents of eastern Ukraine who have fled to neighboring Russia. On July 17, a Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 crashed in eastern Ukraine. All 298 people on board were killed. The passenger jet was most probably shot down by pro-Russian separatists. That could be interpreted as a war crime, said UN Human Rights Commissioner Navi Pillay. Those responsible could face charges before the International Criminal Court. The UN Human Rights Commissioner warns: anybody violating international law will be brought to justice. That also applies to foreign fighters involved in the conflict. Author: Peter Hille You say you want to engage with the Ukrainians living in separatist-held territory?

It is being held two decades after the Kosovo War ended in remembrance of the more than 1,000 children who lost their lives during the conflict. Photographs and stories, as well as personal belongings, such as little sweaters and shoes, a cradle and marbles a child once played with all feature in the exhibition. The parents of the young victims have held onto the items to this day as reminders of those they have lost. Remembering lost family Ejup Caraku from Poklek, a village near Pristina, lost four family members in the war. His two sons, Hasan, 12, and Berat, 13, were killed along with his wife, Baftija, 30, and his sister-in-law, Mihria, 47. It means a lot to him that there is now an exhibition commemorating the youngest victims of war. ""I very much appreciate the idea behind this exhibition. It is good that someone has thought about our children and done something to remember them. We feel a sense of relief, although we know that our wives and children can never be brought back|"" said Caraku. Items belonging to the victims create a moving remembrance at the exhibition Mejreme Kelmendi's children were also killed during the war. She said it's painful to recall the details of the deaths of her sons, Haxhiu and Besimi. The two were only 10 and 12 years old when they died.

""To this day, there is no monument or day of remembrance to commemorate the children who lost their lives|"" said Dea Dedi of the Humanitarian Law Center Kosovo, which organized the exhibition.

The families were extremely cooperative and helpful, and supported our idea|"" she said. She explained that obtaining the children's clothing, school supplies and pictures from their parents was not easy. Most things were burned or lost in the war, and many parents are left with only the memory. But she believes that it's nevertheless important to remember the children who were killed. ""Twenty years after the end of the war, we as a society have to come to terms with what this country has experienced so that something like this never happens again|"" she said. The exhibition is on show at the Hivzi Sylejmani Library in Pristina until May 2020. The Kosovo conflict intensified at the end of the 1990s. Ten thousand people were displaced. When all efforts to bring peace to the region failed, NATO started air strikes on Serbian military bases and strategic targets in Serbia on March 24, 1999. After 11 weeks, Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic finally backed down. Protests against Belgrade's attempts to undermine the rights of the Albanian majority in Kosovo began in the mid-1980s. The 1990s saw a massive increase in Serbian repression. Ibrahim Rugova (l.), who took the reins of Kosovo's political movement in 1989, called for non-violent resistance and sought to convince Slobodan Milosevic (r.) to change course — to no avail. An armed resistance formed in Kosovo, in which the self-proclaimed Kosovo Liberation Army (UCK) began a brutal guerrilla war. The UCK undertook violent attacks on Serbia as well as against Albanians it considered to be collaborators. Serbia retaliated by torching houses and looting businesses. Hundreds of thousands of people fled. The war grew increasingly brutal and Serbian forces stepped up attacks on civilians in an attempt to destroy the UCK and its supporters. Scores of people fled into the forests. Thousands of Kosovo Albanians were loaded onto trains and trucks to be transported to the border, where they were thrown out without passports or other personal documents that could prove they were from Kosovo. In February 1999, the USA, France, the United Kingdom, Russia and Germany convened a meeting of warring parties in Rambouillet, France, in an attempt to establish autonomy for Kosovo. Kosovan representatives accepted the proposal, yet Serbia was unwilling to compromise. The negotiations collapsed. On March 24, 1999, NATO began bombing military and strategic targets in Serbia and Kosovo in an attempt to end violence against the Albanians. Germany also participated in the bombing. ""Operation Allied Force"" became the first war in NATO's 50-year history — one conducted without the backing of the UN Security Council. Russia harshly criticized the intervention. Beyond military targets, NATO also bombed supply lines, train tracks and bridges. Over the course of 79 days and nights, allied forces flew more than 37,000 sorties. Some 20,000 missiles and bombs rained down on Serbia. Many civilians were killed: ""collateral damage|"" in the words of NATO. Industrial sites were also targeted. In Pancevo, near Belgrade, NATO bombs hit a chemical and fertilizer factory. Massive amounts of toxic substances were released into rivers, the ground and the skies — resulting in grave health risks for the nearby civilian population. Moreover, Serbia accused NATO of deploying uranium-enriched munitions as well as cluster and fragment bombs. State television offices in Belgrade were attacked in an attempt to deprive Slobodan Milosevic of his most important propaganda tool. Although the Serbian government was warned of an impending attack in time, Belgrade withheld that information. Sixteen people were killed when the site was bombed. NATO bombs in Kosovo inadvertently hit a group of Albanian refugees, killing an estimated 80 people. NATO also claimed that the accidental bombardment of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade was another case of ""collateral damage."" Four people were killed in the misguided attack, leading to a diplomatic crisis between Beijing and Washington. In early June, Belgrade signaled that Slobodan Milosevic might be prepared to surrender, prompting NATO to end its campaign on June 19. The final toll of the war: thousands of dead and 860,000 refugees. Serbia's economy and large swaths of its infrastructure were destroyed. Kosovo was put under UN administration.

The man was sighted by witnesses on the tower at sunrise. He was reportedly taken in for questioning by police after reaching the top of the building. London police say the man was not arrested after his feat. The building has been climbed in the past, but its proprietors secured a court injunction against Alain Robert, popularly known as the French Spiderman, who wanted to make an attempt in 2012. In 2013, Greenpeace activists climbed the building as a protest against oil drilling in the Arctic. The Shard, located on the banks of the River Thames near London Bridge, houses offices, restaurants, a retail arcade and a hotel. It was inaugurated in 2012. Whether in Berlin, London, Paris, Dubai or New York - skyscrapers and towers with views are popular places for photos in times of Instagram. Not only followers like spectacular views over a city. The TV Tower (368 metres) on Alexanderplatz is the tallest building in Germany. If the weather is fine, you can see up to 40 kilometres from the observation deck. One floor above there is a restaurant that turns on its own axis in half an hour. The Berlin Victory Column (1873) towers 69 metres above the Tiergarten. At the top of this historic vantage point in the German capital stands Victoria, the goddess of victory. The eight meter high figure is also called ""Gold-Else"". 285 steps lead up to the viewing platform at a height of 50 metres via a narrow spiral staircase. Around the Victory Column, car traffic rages on the place ""Großer Stern"", but the park landscape of the Tiergarten stretches all around. It is almost impossible to photograph the highest building in the world (828 meters high) in its entirety. The building has become a landmark for the United Arab Emirates. Who wants to enjoy the panorama from above, takes the lift up to 452 meters height. Since the opening in 2010, this view of downtown Dubai has been possible in principle. On many days, however, haze and dust obscure the view of Dubai Mall and Fountain Lake, which in the dark surprises visitors with illuminated fountains. In the skyline of the French capital, the Tour Montparnasse is an imposition for many. But the highest building of the French capital after the Eiffel Tower (300 meters) with a height of 210 meters offers the best view to all Parisian landmarks. The viewing platform is open daily from 09:30 - 23:30. We recommend the day/night ticket for 23 euros, which allows two visits within 48 hours. The terrace of the Paris skyscraper overlooking the Eiffel Tower is also a popular location for yoga classes. It is the highest building in New York and is also called Freedom Tower. Because here the National 9/11 Memorial commemorates the victims of the terrorist attack of 2001. This is where the World Trade Center with the Twin Towers used to stand. With the elevators (Sky Pods) it goes in 47 seconds to the 102nd floor. Here New York lies at one's feet. The viewing platform extends over three different levels. All visitors must pass through the security checkpoint. Only a small bag is allowed. There is no cloakroom or lockers on site. With the Stop'n Watch telescope you can take a look at the banking district of the Main metropolis. As Frankfurt's only high-rise building to date, it invites visitors to a viewing platform at a height of 200 metres. Frankfurt at night is a frequent photo motif. At #maintower you can find a selection of snapshots of the Main Tower visitors. The glass viewing platform under the top of the skyscraper ""Shard"" offers a unique view over the British capital on beautiful days. But the view to the Thames, the Tower Bridge, the City - the business centre or the famous power station of Battersea can also have a great attraction in light fog.

"a-49511911"|"https://www.dw.com/en/opinion-greek-government-change-amid-beach-holiday/a-49511911"|"Spiros Moskovou"|"""You don't want to ruin the people's beach holiday|"" Andreas Papandreou, a former socialist Greek prime minister, once warned in the 1980s when his advisers tried to persuade him to hold early elections in the middle of summer. Alexis Tsipras, the left-wing prime minister, ignored that political wisdom and called new elections during the main holiday season. More than 40% of voters spurned the ballot boxes — and Tsipras and his Syriza governing party were voted out of office. With the greater number of votes by far, the conservative Nea Dimokratia's candidate, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, won a parliamentary majority. The change of government in Greece, however, is not only due to the high summer temperatures. Well aware that a return to the pre-crisis era is impossible, voters in the crisis-ridden country are simply disillusioned. Tsipras was elected by a majority of Greeks in 2015 because he said he would ""tear up"" the austerity programs earmarked for the bankrupt country and dictate his wishes to the financial markets. Instead, after three elections within the span of a year, he agreed to a third rescue package with the country's international donors and continued his predecessors' austerity policies. The Left Revolution dwindled to handling the crisis in a Social Democratic manner. Economic recovery was too slow The Tsipras government turned out to be the longest-lasting since 2010, when Greece asked its EU partners for support because it could no longer refinance itself in the markets. During Syriza's rule, Greece reverted to weak growth and, as expected, the third and final bailout program was completed in summer 2018. Athens can once again refinance itself, has saved up a small financial cushion and benefits from the revenues of a booming tourism sector. In other words, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, a rather moderate politician, is not taking over a country on the brink of the abyss. All the same, people expect a lot from this representative of an old political dynasty. Greece is still being closely monitored by its donors and over the next few years, it will need stronger growth to achieve the agreed surplus. Unemployment has fallen from 26% to 18%, but is still the highest in the EU. The country urgently needs the investments that the left-wing Syriza party was unable to push forward because of its original aversion to the private sector. Nea Dimokratia — one of the parties that bear the main responsibility for the Greek crisis — must now prove to be a responsible force. The party is not likely to touch Tsipras' greatest achievement: the agreement with North Macedonia to settle the decades-long anachronistic dispute over the neighboring country's name. While Mitsotakis has repeatedly criticized the agreement, saying he planned to renegotiate some parts, he is actually unlikely to do so, because even if he can lure the more ""ethnically minded"" voters with just that bit more patriotism than necessary, he would alienate the international community."|"For the time being, the conservative victory in Greece's snap elections spells the end for Alexis Tsipras' ""leftist revolution.""

Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi told reporters on Monday that Iran won't offer any further ""deadlines"" to save the deal, which the US pulled out of last year. The end of the latest 60-day deadline is September 5. ""The West should not criticize the legitimate decisions of Iran, but find practical solutions to convince us to stay in the deal|"" Mousavi said. ""We have no hope nor trust in anyone nor any country but the door of diplomacy is open."" When asked if Tehran would withdraw from the deal entirely, Mousavi said ""all the options"" were possible but ""no decision has been taken."" Read more: Iran violates nuclear deal — what comes next? Iran has reduced its commitments to the Iran nuclear deal, formally the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action or JCPOA, every 60 days to prompt other signatories of the deal to help Iran find ways around US sanctions. On Sunday, Iran announced its intention to raise enrichment levels beyond the 3.67% threshold agreed under the 2015 agreement. The announcement came less than a week after Tehran acknowledged that Iran had exceeded a stock limit of 300 kilograms (661 pounds) on its low-enriched uranium production. Mousavi did not specify what the third deliberate violation of the nuclear deal would be. Enriched uranium The spokesman for Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, Behrouz Kamalvandi, was quoted by the ISNA and Fars news agencies as saying that the country is now enriching uranium to 4.5%. He separately hinted in a state television interview on Monday that the Middle Eastern nation may consider going to 20% enrichment or higher as its third step based on material needs. The IAEA confirmed later on Monday that Iran had exceeded the 3.67% threshold but did not specify by how much. Read more: Rouhani: Iran to enrich uranium to 'any amount' it wants Enriched uranium at the 3.67% level, as agreed upon in the deal, is enough for peaceful pursuits but is far below weapons-grade levels of 90%. However, 20% enrichment is a short technical step away from reaching that 90% level. ""Twenty percent is not needed now but, if we want, we will produce it. When we've put aside 3.67% enrichment we have no obstacle or problem with this action|"" Kamalvandi said. ""There is the 20% option and there are options even higher than that but each in its own place. Today if our country's needs are one thing, we won't pursue something else just to scare the other side a little more."" Kamalvandi said using new or more centrifuges, which are limited by the deal, is also an option for Iran's third step in reducing its nuclear deal commitments. President Donald Trump announced on May 8, 2018 that he was pulling the United States out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, arguing that the international accord was not in America's ""national interest."" The decision threw a cloud of uncertainty over the future of the nuclear accord and raised tensions with US allies in Europe. Britain, France and Germany lobbied the Trump administration and Congress to remain in the nuclear accord, arguing that the deal was working and a US violation without a follow up plan would be destabilizing. In European capitals, the Trump administration's withdrawal was viewed as a slap in the face of allies. A year to the day after Trump's announcement, Iran informed the other signatories of the accord that they would no longer adhere to certain ""voluntary commitments."" Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said the signatory nations had 60 days to implement promises to protect Iran's oil and banking sectors or Iran would resume the enrichment of uranium. The decision came after the United States deployed an aircraft, the USS Lincoln, along with a bomber task force to the Middle East. Washington said the deployment was intended as a ""clear unmistakable message."" Iran said it took action because the European Union and others ""did not have the power to resist US pressure."" The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), better known as the Iran nuclear deal, was signed in 2015 by United States, China, Russia, France, Germany and Britain (P5+1) and Iran following years of negotiations. Under the international agreement, Iran agreed to dismantle its nuclear program and be subject to monitoring in exchange for the lifting of international nuclear related sanctions. The JCPOA includes a robust monitoring, verification and inspection regime carried out by International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The UN watch dog has verified Iran's compliance with the deal in 12 quarterly reports. The JCPOA allows Iran to pursue a peaceful nuclear program for commercial, medical and industrial purposes in line with international non-proliferation standards. The Iran nuclear deal was President Barack Obama's signature foreign policy achievement. Seeking to undo nearly every Obama administration legacy, Trump came into office calling it the ""worst deal ever."" The Trump administration argues the nuclear deal doesn't address other unrelated issues such as Iran's ballistic missiles, regional influence, support for ""terrorist"" groups and human rights. The nuclear deal and lifting of punishing nuclear related international sanctions created optimism in Iran after years of economic isolation. However, even before Trump pulled the US out of the deal, Tehran blamed the US for holding back international investment and not fulfilling its end of the bargain due to the uncertainty created by Trump's threats. After eight years with Barack Obama, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu found the US president he wanted in Donald Trump. The Israeli leader repeatedly slammed the deal despite his own military and intelligence chiefs' assessment the that JCPOA, while not perfect, was working and should be maintained. Saudi Arabia and the UAE are the other main opponents of the nuclear deal. The EU-3 (Britain, France, Germany) have scrambled to ensure that Iran receives the economic benefits it was promised in order to avoid Tehran pulling out of the deal. As EU businesses face retaliation from the US for doing business with Iran, many are opting to avoid Iran. This would likely be a present to Chinese and Russian businesses. Concern in Europe In response to Iran boosting its uranium enrichment, Germany, one of the five remaining signatories to the deal, said on Monday that Iran must be persuaded to stick to its commitments. ""The ball is clearly in Iran's court. We want to preserve the deal|"" a German Foreign Ministry spokesman said. An European Union spokeswoman said on Monday that the bloc is ""extremely concerned"" about Iran's decision to breach the enrichment limit, calling on Tehran to ""stop and reverse"" any actions that go against the nuclear deal. EU countries have sought to keep the accord alive by developing a money transaction system known as INSTEX that allows Iran to circumvent US sanctions and continue doing business internationally. But Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has rejected the system because it doesn't include the country's oil sector. Blame on US Russia, another signatory, expressed its concerns over the enrichment cap breach. Kremlin spokesman Dimitry Peskov said Monday that Russia ""aims to continue dialogue and efforts on the diplomatic front."" Peskov added that Sunday's announcement by Iran was one of the ""consequences"" of the US abandoning the deal. China was another signatory to put blame on the US, saying that ""unilateral bullying"" by the Americans was the cause behind the escalating Iran nuclear crisis. ""The facts show that unilateral bullying has already became a worsening tumor|"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in Beijing on Monday. ""The maximum pressure exerted by the US on Iran is the root cause of the Iranian nuclear crisis."" Following Iran's announcement on Sunday, US President Donald Trump issued a warning towards the country, saying Tehran had ""better be careful."" Vice President Mike Pence chimed in later on Monday, warning Tehran that it should not ""confuse American restraint with a lack of American resolve.""

Around 70 people took part in the sit-in, barring the several of the bank's entrances with bikes and large potted plants. Protesters also carried a banner reading: ""Climate Emergency Sponsored by Credit Suisse."" Some of the activists had chained themselves to nearby objects and had to be cut away, police said. Authorities also carried away protesters who refused to leave. Some protesters were carried away by police after refusing to leave the sit-in Protest organizers the Collective Climate Justice Group said on Twitter that the police action ""actively protects the environmentally destructive interests of (Credit Suisse) and opposes a fossil-free, climate-friendly future."" A similar climate protest also took place outside the headquarters of Switzerland's largest bank, UBS, in the city of Basel. Fridays for Future protest kicks off in Cologne Elsewhere in Europe, student protesters with the ""Fridays for Future"" youth climate movement began a week-long protest in the western German city of Cologne on Monday. Over 70 participants joined the demonstration when it began at 9 a.m. (0700 GMT) outside Cologne's main train station. Starting on Tuesday, the protest will run round-the-clock, with students taking shifts overnight. Students in Cologne plan to protest round-the-clock this week to urge for action on climate change The protest is due to end on Friday, when schools in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia go on summer vacation. The Fridays for Future movement, which was inspired by Swedish teen activist Greta Thunberg, involves students leaving school on Fridays to urge for more government action to combat climate change. The movement has seen a wave of support around the world, but also pushback from local governments who urge students to attend class, as school attendance is compulsory in Germany. ""Why study, if our future is being destroyed?"" This sign features a sentiment shared by increasing numbers of German students, who have joined young people worldwide in using Friday school strikes to call for action on climate change. The movement was inspired by 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who began her protests alone in front of the Swedish parliament in August 2018. With the 2015 Paris climate accord, nearly all of the world's countries committed to limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, preferably 1.5 degrees (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), by 2100. The hope is that this target will prevent the worst effects of climate disasters. Concerned by the dire predictions from climate scientists, more and more people have called for immediate action. Despite urgent warnings, politicians have dragged their heels on important climate decisions. It's become clear that Germany will miss its targets for 2020. Climate protection was an important factor in the European elections in late May, with the Greens winning more than 20% of the vote in Germany alone, more than double previous results. Among 18-24-year-olds, 34% backed the party. Germany's climate movement is fighting on many fronts. In recent years, activists have fought to preserve Hambach Forest in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, building treehouses to prevent the old-growth forest from being felled to make way for the mining of lignite, or brown coal. Energy giant RWE has launched legal action, and police have cleared the camp several times. In September 2018, a few days after the camp was removed again, a court ruling suspended the clearing of the forest until late 2020, after a lawsuit by environmental group BUND. RWE has argued that the forest has to be cut in order to ensure the coal necessary for Germany's electricity supply. Around 50,000 activists celebrated the victory. Protests organized by groups such as Ende Gelände have increasingly been making headlines. Thousands of young activists have come out to staged events, blocking railway tracks used to deliver coal to power plants near Cologne and occupying huge coal excavators, as seen here in the open-pit mine in the east German town of Welzow in 2016. In January 2019, after seven months of negotiations, a coal commission set up by the federal government to work out Germany's plans to phase out coal power released its findings. It recommended that Germany should continue coal mining until 2038, at the latest —far too late for the country to meet the targets of the 2015 Paris climate accord. An increasing number of young people in Germany are demanding that the government find a way to meet the 1.5-degree target. The emerging Fridays for Future movement has been getting support from longtime environmentalists, teachers, academics and parents. They have called for all German coal-fired power plants to be shut down by 2030, and for renewable energy initiatives to be vastly expanded.

The Trump administration has been strongly criticized for its efforts to undermine UN approaches to women's rights. Most recently, the US threatened to veto a UN Security Council resolution condemning sexual violence against women in armed conflict because it claimed the resolution's wording opened the door to abortion. The Trump administration has repeatedly attempted to remove language on sexual and reproductive rights from a number of UN resolutions. The US also cut funding for the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) in 2017, claiming that it fostered ""a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization.""

In the address, which came as EU leaders Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk were set to arrive in Kyiv, Zelenskiy proposed: ""I suggest the following lineup for talks: me, you, US President Donald Trump, British Prime Minister Theresa May, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and French President Emmanuel Macron.""

Send Facebook Twitter google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/3Kequ No end in sight for five-year conflict The conflict began in March 2014, when pro-Russian separatists staged an uprising in eastern Ukraine's Donbass region after pro-Kremlin President Viktor Yanukovich was forced to flee the country in February 2014. The actions took place shortly after Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula in February and March 2014, sparking international condemnation. Since then, some 13,000 people have been killed in eastern Ukraine. Russia has strongly denied any involvement in the region, despite ample evidence that it has continually shipped arms and troops into the area. Though peace talks involving Ukraine, Russia, France, and Germany resulted in the so-called Minsk Agreements in 2014 and early 2015, both sides have violated the terms of the ceasefire agreement, and the situation remains at an impasse.

Tusk, who will soon be leaving his post, said it would likely be his last trip to Kyiv, noting: ""There are some in Brussels who brand me a pro-Ukraine maniac. They often said it right to my face. To be honest, I'm very proud of that epithet."" The EU has been unapologetically supportive of Ukraine, issuing sanctions against Russia in an effort to force its hand. Tusk underscored the deteriorating state of the situation, saying ""The tragedy in eastern Ukraine continues with disastrous humanitarian consequences for local people trapped by Russia's war."" Fighting between pro-Russian separatists and the Ukrainian army has intensified around the cities of Luhansk and Donetsk. The situation for the local population keeps getting worse, the UN Human Rights Commission finds. It especially accuses the pro-Russian separatists of severe crimes. More than 1,100 people have been killed in the fighting since mid-April, according to the UN. Not just armed fighters, but also countless civilians, among them many children, have lost their lives. These people grieve for a father and his little son who died in artillery fire near Luhansk. Civilians often get caught in the crossfire, according to the UN. Heavy weaponry is being employed in densely populated areas not just by the separatists, like here in Donetsk, but also by the Ukrainian army. The United Nations urge all sides to exercise better measures of precaution to protect civilians’ lives. The report accuses the pro-Russian separatists of abducting, torturing and executing people. The separatists are ""rough and brutal"" as well as ""well-equipped and organized"" and often under the command of Russian nationals, according to the UN Human Rights Commission. The UN body has 39 observers on the ground and has documented more than 800 cases of abductions by separatists since mid-April. More than 100,000 people have had to leave their homes. Many live in emergency shelters, like here in Kharkiv, to escape the terror of the separatists and the fighting. There are also reports about Russian-speaking residents of eastern Ukraine who have fled to neighboring Russia. On July 17, a Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 crashed in eastern Ukraine. All 298 people on board were killed. The passenger jet was most probably shot down by pro-Russian separatists. That could be interpreted as a war crime, said UN Human Rights Commissioner Navi Pillay. Those responsible could face charges before the International Criminal Court. The UN Human Rights Commissioner warns: anybody violating international law will be brought to justice. That also applies to foreign fighters involved in the conflict.

The deal has yet to be finalized and signed. A meeting between the two sides planned for Saturday was postponed to Sunday. The new governing body aims to install a transitional civilian administration for a period of just over three years, presided over by a military nominee for the first 21 months, and by a civilian for the last 18 months. In another twist to the crisis, the military said on Thursday it had foiled an attempt by 12 soldiers to seize power. For weeks — even during Ramadan — thousands of protesters camped outside Sudan's defense ministry, demanding a transitional council in which civilians could decide the future of the country. In early June the military moved in and forcefully removed the protesters. Dozens of people died and those who survived reported rapes, sexual abuse, and the use of force. A protester holds up the national flag outside the army headquarters. His demand: that Sudan's Transitional Military Council hand over power to the civilians. This, the protesters believe, will be an important step towards democracy. In early June, just days ahead of the crackdown on the sit-in, the military increased its presence on the streets. Many protesters predicted that the army would not want to hand over power. This was what they hoped for after the ousting of longtime president Omar al-Bashir. From 1989 until his April 2019, Omar al-Bashir ruled Sudan. He suppressed critics. In 1999 he even dismantled parliament in order to maintain his grip on power. His name will, however, be remembered for his handling of the Darfur crisis. His troops' harsh response led to thousands of deaths, and for that, he is wanted for crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court. Many Sudanese had been waiting for this day for a long time — the day when Omar al-Bashir would have to face a court. On June 16, he appeared before prosecutors, accused of corruption and the illegal possession of foreign currency. After being ousted, security forces found over one million US dollars stashed away in his villa. Many women actively participated in the protests, and they gave the protests a different face. Their presence underlined the protesters demand for democracy and equal rights. During the brutal crackdown by security forces, many women reported sexual abuse and rape as a means to silence them. Architecture student Alaa Salah became the face of the revolution. A photographer shot this picture as she stood on top of a car and addressed protesters. Photos and videos of her protest chants trended on social media. Online she is known as ""Kandaka"" or the Nubian queen. Thanks to social media, the protests rapidly caught international attention and support from human rights groups and Sudanese living abroad. In a statement, the EU's foreign ministers urged for an immediate end to all forms of violence against Sudanese civilians. But not all Sudanese civilians are against the army. Some people, in fact, want a tough military rule to give the country security and strength. The army supporters have placed their faith in General Abdel Fattah Burhan, the head of the Transitional Military Council. The real power, however, lies not with General Abdel Fattah Burhan, but his deputy, General Mohammed Hamdan Daglu, also known as ""Hemeti."" He heads the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) who cracked down brutally on the protesters. During the war in Darfur, he commanded the feared Janjaweed militias. The protesters fear that he could, in the end, take power. The protests continued unabated throughout June. Military leaders on Monday, June 23, turned down a proposal for a power-sharing deal. The protest leaders, represented by the coalition Forces for Declaration of Freedom and Change, which includes the Sudanese Professional's Association, had accepted the deal which was negotiated with the help of Ethiopia. On July 5 members of the military and protest movement representatives announced they had reached a deal to share power. For the next three years, a transitional council consisting of six civilians and five military figures will lead the country. Democratic elections will then be held. People in Khartoum celebrated the news, though the practicalities of implementation cause conflict to reignite. Politicians of other Arab nations continue to watch the developments in Sudan with a certain degree of concern. Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, it is believed, fears that successful grassroots protests could set an example for citizens in the Arab Peninsula. Both the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia appear to be supporting the military regime. Cairo seems similarly concerned about the events in Khartoum. Egyptian president Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi (pictured l. with Omar al-Bashir in 2018) fears that the Muslim Brotherhood, which Eygpt has been trying to silence, could fall on fertile ground in Sudan. If the Muslim Brotherhood gains support in Sudan, al-Sisi believes that its success might strengthen the group again in Egypt.

Some are carriers, some build the cargo as well — satellites, supplies, people. SpaceX, for instance, is in the process of launching 12,000 of its own satellites for a space-based broadband network, spanning the globe 24-7. The project called Starlink is a good example of the new space race. Engineers working on it are said to feel the heat from CEO Elon Musk, who in turn can feel the heat from rival firm, OneWeb.

Call it contrived or cynical, but the USA is in this race as well. NASA wants its Artemis mission to be the first to land a woman on the moon by 2024. But it's not just gender. The Apollo program was dominated by white men. African Americans, and other people of color, were not excluded but certainly under-represented. The race to change that has been slow. Guy Bluford became the first African American astronaut in space in 1983 — more than 20 years after President Kennedy announced the plan to land on the moon. More recently Sunita Williams, who has Indo-Slovenian heritage, has been on two ISS Expeditions. But she remains in a minority.

A deep freeze In hindsight, it's easy to say that human space exploration began a deep freeze when the Apollo program ended in 1972. But a lot of enthusiasm did go with it. Other political priorities took over, like the Vietnam War. NASA's Shuttle Program was called into life the same year Apollo died. And it lasted more than three decades. Apollo was just three years.

The first XPRIZE led to the design and build of SpaceShipOne seen here in the Mojave Desert.

It has largely been spared commercial pressures. But that's changing, too. US President Donald Trump has made it clear that he wants NASA to hand over more of its work to industry players. He wants the ISS, and indeed all of space, to be run like a business. There's a rush in new space, and Trump know it. It's like the Gold Rush. There are minerals and resources to be mined on asteroids, and you'll be served as you come. According to NASA research, the moon is slowly losing heat, which causes its surface to shrivel up like a grape turning into a raisin. But that's not all: its interior is shrinking! The moon has become about 50 meters (150 feet) ""skinnier"" over the past several hundred million years. Conspiracy theorists believe that the lunar landing was a fake, and that Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked around on July 21st, 1969, on a soundstage instead of the moon. They point to the fact that the flag planted by Aldrin waved as if moved by the wind, which would be impossible in space's vacuum. NASA's explanation: Aldrin was twisting the flagpole while planting it in the ground. If it's summer in your neck of the woods, you might be sweating right now. But just remember: temperatures are little more extreme on the moon. When the sun hits its surface, it can get up to 127 degrees Celsius (260 degrees Fahrenheit) hot. Without the warm glow, temperatures can drop down to -153 degrees Celsius (-243 degrees Fahrenheit). Brrr! The myth of a person living on the moon has existed for almost as long as Earth's satellite itself. Some people see a face on the surface of the full moon, composed of the dark lunar plains and the lighter lunar highlands. Many cultures have tales about an actual person who committed some kind of misdeed and was banished to the moon for it. Astronauts are yet to encounter them, though. The moon is drifting away from Earth at a speed of almost 4 centimeters (1.5 inches) per year. The farther away our satellite is, the smaller it appears to us. In about 550 million years, it'll look too small to ever ""cover"" all of the sun, even at its closest position to Earth. That'll mean no more total solar eclipses. Ah, howling at the moon — no old-timey scary movie is complete without it. But in fact, wolves do not intensify their howling when a full moon rolls around, and they don't direct their howls at the moon, either. They simply yowl at night, which is also the time when a full moon is most visible. That could be one reason our ancestors drew the connection. 12 humans have walked on the moon so far. While they come from various professional fields, they have a couple of things in common: All of them are American, all of them are white and all of them are men. Let's see where the first non-American on the moon will be from — maybe it'll be a woman and/or person of color, too! Author: Carla Bleiker On June 16 1963, skilled Russian parachutist Valentina Tereshkova became the first woman in space, finishing 48 orbits of the earth in her space capsule Vostok 6. It would be almost 20 years until another woman left earth's atmosphere — Svetlana Savitskaya in 1982 on the Soyuz T-7 mission. A crater on the moon is named after Tereshkova who now sits as a member of Russia's parliament, the Duma. NASA selected Shannon Lucid, Margaret Seddon, Kathryn Sullivan, Judith Resnik, Anna Fisher, and Sally Ride as their first female astronaut candidates in January 1978. A number of American women passed the astronaut selection process in the early 1960s but were not eligible to go into space because they had not completed military jet test pilot training — a career that was unavailable to women. The first American woman in space was due to go on a third mission before the infamous Challenger disaster cut short her training in 1986. But Sally Ride made history by using robotic arms to retrieve satellites in her first two missions and later devoting her life to helping girls excel in math, science and engineering, according to President Barack Obama. She died from pancreatic cancer in 2012. Inspired by Sally Ride, Mae Jemison — physician, teacher, Peace Corps volunteer and founder of two technology companies — became the first African-American woman in space when she embarked with the Endeavor in September 1992 to conduct bone cell experiments. As chief of the 100 Year Starship program she hopes to make human flight beyond the solar system possible this century. Chiaki Mukai (center) trained as a doctor in Japan and went on to become the first Japanese woman to leave the earth, conducting multiple medical experiments in microgravity environments allowing for the study of aging in space. Her two voyages in 1994 and 1998 also allowed her to support the deployment of the Hubble Space Telescope. Kalpana means ""creativity"" or ""imagination"" in Sanskrit. After becoming the first Indian-born woman to go to space, Kalpana Chawla's first mission was to deploy satellites to study the surface of the sun in 1997. But after her second mission was delayed three years before taking off in 2003, Chawla's Columbia shuttle broke up on re-entry into the earths atmosphere, killing the entire crew. Becoming a multi-millionaire entrepreneur by the age of 32 might be enough for most people, but in September 2006 Anousheh Ansari also became not only the first Iranian-born astronaut in space but also the first ever female private space explorer. After arriving at the International Space Station, she saw earth: ""So peaceful, so full of life."" As the first female commander of the International Space Station, Peggy Whitson also holds another slightly daunting record — almost 666 days in space, the longest length for any woman. After numerous space walks, Whitson returned to earth last in 2017 after 289 days on the multi-national mission, also making her the oldest woman to go to space.

At the elections in May, she campaigned for an ""ambitious green transition"" – encompassing industry, agriculture and the transport sectors to lead the way in environmental conservation and the fight against climate change. She was involved in the ""Fridays for Future"" climate protests, and admits she probably wouldn't be in Brussels had young people not taken to the streets first.

Authorities were on high alert as Barry's path skirted across the western periphery of New Orleans, where 14 years ago Hurricane Katrina devastated the city and surrounding areas. The US National Hurricane Center warned of dangerous storm surge, heavy rains and strong winds.

Memories of deadly Hurricane Katrina in 2005 were likely present in their minds. The low-lying coastal area of the state is particularly prone to flooding and much of it has already been lost through erosion. A delivery truck used the sidewalk to get around cars stalled on the flooded streets of New Orleans. Compounding concerns, on Saturday the National Weather Service warned of extreme weather capable of producing tornadoes that was approaching St. Bernard Parish and Plaquemines Parish, to the west of the Crescent City, as New Orleans is affectionately referred to. Since Hurricane Katrina devastated the city in 2005, work has been underway on a multibillion-dollar hurricane-protection system. Residents are hoping that, though incomplete, it could prevent the worst damage. But some aren't taking any chances. Barry grew in the Gulf of Mexico over a few days. The main force of the storm brushed the western edge of New Orleans, narrowly missing a direct hit. But Mayor LaToya Cantrell said the expected downpours could still be too much for the pumps designed to free streets of excess water. Barry was briefly classified as a hurricane when sustained winds hit 119 kph (74 mph). Here, the gate of the US Customs House in New Orleans is seen sandbagged in the hope of stemming the surge. The Mississippi River, which flows through the city, is forecast to rise to as high as 5.2 meters (17.1 feet) on Saturday — the highest level since 1950, and close to the top of the city's levees. This street in New Orleans' Garden District suffered flooding days before the actual storm arrived. Some residents parked their cars on raised median strips hoping to protect them from flood damage. People were advised to store at least three days of supplies. Thirty thousand people had lost power in Southern Louisiana by early Saturday. Hurricane Katrina, which hit New Orleans in 2005, caused catastrophic flooding and was blamed for as many as 1,800 deaths in Louisiana and other states. Some areas, like this, still showed the damage half a year on from the disaster.

The government's decision to introduce a controversial extradition bill triggered mass protests in the territory, giving rise to its worst political crisis since its 1997 handover to China. Critics see the bill as a threat to Hong Kong's rule of law. The legislation would have allowed criminal suspects in Hong Kong to be extradited to other places, including mainland China, where courts remain under the control of the ruling Communist Party. The sometimes violent street protests have drawn in millions of people, with hundreds even storming the city's legislature on July 1 to oppose the now-suspended bill. Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam recently said the bill was ""dead|"" but opponents vow to settle for nothing short of its formal withdrawal. The anti-extradition demonstrations over the past month seem to have reawakened other movements in Hong Kong.

The Vatican confirmed that two sets of bones were found in two ossuaries discovered this week after excavators opened the nearby tombs of two 19th-century German princesses in a cemetery adjacent to St. Peter's Basilica.

In 2017, a newspaper published a five-page document that had been stolen from a locked Vatican cabinet that suggested the Holy See had been involved in Orlandi's disappearance. The Vatican denied the document was real. Shortly after her disappearance, police did not exclude the possibility that Orlandi may have been abducted and killed for reasons with no connection to the Vatican or been a victim of human trafficking.

The Teutonic Cemetery is a burial ground just inside the Vatican walls used over the centuries mainly for Church figures or members of noble families of German or Austrian origin. There is so much to see in Rome even half a year is not enough to discover everything. So what to do when you only have three days? First, of course, visit the highlights. Among the highlights there is the Colosseum, the largest antique amphitheater in the world with around 50,000 seats. However, as many people want to see it, you have to queue for a long time. It is therefore best to buy a ticket in advance online. You can also buy a combined ticket for the Colosseum and the Forum Romanum. The Forum was the center of Rome, where Cicero delivered his ingenious speeches and the Roman emperors celebrated their victories. Today it is a picturesque ruined landscape in the middle of the modern city. My tip: look at the 3D reconstructions online help to better imagine the Forum of Antiquity. After a break you can continue on foot, because the next sight is not far away: the Pantheon at the Piazza della Rotonda with its impressive dome. It was once a Roman sanctuary for all their gods. Since the 16th century it has been used as a funeral church for important personalities such as the painter Raphael or King Victor Emanuel II. From the Pantheon continue on to Italy's most famous fountain. Those who have already fallen in love with Rome and want to return, toss a coin over their shoulder into the water. According to legend, this is a guarantee for another visit to Rome. As many tourists like the Eternal City, around one million euros a year end up in the fountain. I lived near Piazza Navona, one of the most beautiful squares in Rome. Almost every evening I came here to enjoy a drink and the wonderful atmosphere between babbling fountains, baroque churches and magnificent buildings, restaurants and cafés. In my opinion, this is the best place to end a strenuous tour. Start the next day well rested at St. Peter's Basilica. Clearly Rome is famous for both its ancient heritage and for its Vatican City. Accordingly, the queues are also very long here. St. Peter's Basilica is one of the largest churches in the world and has a magnificent interior and exterior design. The highlights include the baptismal fountain, the papal tombs and the statue of St. Peter. The ascent to the cupola of St. Peter's is something special, because it goes along the vaulted inner wall of the dome to the observation platform at a height of approx. 117 meters (384 ft). There are over 550 steps to climb. From the top you have a wonderful view of St. Peter's Square and the city. Since you are already at the Vatican, a detour to the Castel Sant'Angelo is worth it. It was built in the 2nd century as a mausoleum for the Roman Emperor Hadrian and later converted into a fortress. The Popes could escape through a secret passageway from the Vatican Palace to the Castel Sant'Angelo and seek refuge behind the mighty walls. Today the round building is home to the National Museum. After two days of sightseeing you should definitely treat yourself to an ice cream. Many ice cream parlors have a huge selection of flavors. My favorite ice cream was Bacio - a ""kiss"" of chocolate and hazelnut. Or if you are more hungry get a slice of pizza on your hand and then just stroll through the streets of Rome. Usually I had a specific destination besides Piazza Navona: The Spanish Steps surrounded by cafés, restaurants and fashion boutiques are still one of the largest open staircases of the Baroque period. Here many tourists and locals meet, sit on the steps, stroll and chat. Street performers entertain while street vendors offer their goods for sale. ""La vita è bella"" (Life is beautiful) is the motto here. Rome is beautiful, but it can also be very tiring. It is often hot, the traffic chaotic, many people out and about and pickpockets on the move. Therefore, my tip would be to head outside the gates of Rome on the last day. There is much to discover in the surrounding area. Like the Via Appia Antica, which was one of the most important trade routes in Italy during the Roman Empire. The train takes you comfortably to Ostia Antica, Rome's ancient port city which once had 50,000 inhabitants. The area of ruins with thermal baths, theaters, temples and houses is so expansive that tourists can spread out and immerse themselves in peace and quiet in the ancient world of the Romans. Some buildings are so well preserved that you don't need as much imagination as the Forum Romanum. A visit to Bella Italia without beach and sea? Not in Rome! From Ostia Antica it is not far to the Roman's favored beach at Lido di Ostia. It' s usually very busy here and many leave behind their litter, but if you are able to find a place for yourself, preferably further south, it is the perfect way to end your short trip to Rome.

She was told that her former employer, the Asia Plus media group, would have to let her go because of ""pressure from above."" In October of that same year, several anonymous individuals began tailing her. Bakhtiyar left the country in June 2016 and applied for asylum in Germany. After she was spotted at a meeting of exiled Tajiks in 2017, Tajik intelligence agents began following her father. Bakhtiyar tells DW that her father, who teaches medicine, was threatened. He was told he would lose his job if his daughter did not return. Then authorities threatened to jail him in his daughter's place. He is still free, but Bakhtiyar is afraid of what might happen to him. When Tajikistan gained independence after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, conflicts between the country's pro-communist government and opposition forces intensified — fueled by political, religious and regional differences. With support from Moscow, President Emomali Rahmon (pictured at top) took power during the ensuing civil war in 1992. One by one, he did away with opposition figures and concentrated power in the hands of his family and close friends. According to official statistics, Rahmon won the last presidential election in 2013 with 86.6% of the vote. His current term of office ends in 2020. After journalist Humayro Bakhtiyar fled the country, the authorities threatened her father 'Enemy of the people' ""I left Tajikistan in 1992, at the beginning of the civil war|"" recalls journalist Temur Varki. When an issue of the Tajik Press, a newspaper that he published, was burned at a rally by Rahmon's supporters, he fled to Russia. ""I described the government as a 'red-brown junta,' bent on mass ethnic cleansing. Rahmon went on television to label me an enemy of the people|"" says Varki, adding that the president also warned him not to forget that he still had relatives in Tajikistan. Read more: Kazakhstan rewrites its alphabet to shed its Soviet past In 2014, Russia began repatriating Tajik refugees. Fearing for his life, Varki fled to France in the spring of 2015 and was recognized as a political refugee. That status, however, afforded him no peace of mind. ""Anonymous fake accounts posted comments about my online publications and threatened to rape my wife and my daughter|"" says Varki. Family imprisoned In 2016, human rights attorney Jamshed Yorov was thrown in prison, supposedly for betraying state secrets. He was released two months later and quietly sneaked out of the country in January 2017. His wife and daughter also had airline tickets and were planning to leave the country in February. ""But they were not allowed to leave, authorities took away their passports|"" says Yorov. His family has been threatened with violence and rape. Human rights lawyer Jamshed Yorov was jailed for two months in 2016 Yorov's older brother Buzurgmehr, a prominent human rights lawyer in his own right, was arrested in 2015 and sentenced to 28 years in prison. Rights groups still say that his trial was a farce, overshadowed by myriad breaches of procedure. ""We often defended opponents of the government in court|"" says Yorov. Although Yorov has heard that his brother is holding up well in prison, he fears that he, like many prisoners in Tajikistan, is being tortured. Total surveillance Journalist Mavjuda Sohibnazarova is also an opposition figure and political activist from Tajikistan. Today she lives in a refugee camp in the Netherlands, but in 2013 she and former Industry Minister Zayd Saidov planned to found the New Tajikistan party. In 2014, Saidov was sentenced to 26 years in prison. Read more: Belarus strongman Lukashenko marks 25 years in power ""Soon thereafter I started to receive threats|"" Sohibnazarova told DW.

""No matter where I applied for a new job, the answer was always: 'If we hire you, we'll lose our own jobs. Orders from above,'"" Sohibnazarova says. In 2017, friends helped get her out of the country. Journalist Mavjuda Sohibnazarova lost her job and ultimately fled Tajikistan Sohibnazarova was later spotted in a video recording of a Tajik exile meeting in Europe, together with Muhiddin Kabiri, the leader of the Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan. The party, which signed a 1997 peace agreement with President Rahmon to end the bloody civil war, was banned in 2015. ""I hadn't even left the conference when threats against me and my children started raining in on my phone|"" she says. Sohibnazarova says that most of those threats were anonymous and again had to do with raping her daughter and killing her son. Her son left Tajikistan shortly thereafter, but her daughter stayed behind to care for her ailing grandmother. Police and intelligence services constantly harass Sohibnazarova's daughter, threatening to kidnap her mother and bring her back to Tajikistan. Rights group say the Tajik government has been forcibly returning political activists to the country since 2015. Journalist Khayrullo Mirsaidov, who has also worked with DW, stresses this practice is kept hidden from public scrutiny. ""But pressure is put on relatives so that those who have fallen out of grace return home|"" says Mirsaidov."|"From surveillance to outright threats, Tajik authorities are making life difficult for the families of political activists who have fled abroad.

The band Sturmwehr (Storm Forces) played a banned song, while Unbeliebte Jungs (Unpopular Boys) played a track that was not on the list which they submitted to authorities prior to the concert.

Far-right surge Far-right groups regularly hold rock concerts in eastern Germany, where their support is relatively higher than other parts of the country. In December last year, German police shut down a far-right concert in Ostritz, a small town in the eastern state of Saxony, after members of the crowd started chanting the Nazi salute ""Sieg Heil"" (Hail Victory).

The fatal stabbing of a German man, allegedly by asylum-seekers, in the city of Chemnitz in August 2018, triggered violent far-right protests across Saxony. Read more: Violence in Chemnitz: A timeline of events More than 65,000 people turned out for the #wirsindmehr (literally ""we are more"") concert in Chemnitz to protest against neo-Nazi violence.

The lineup included a mix of local Chemnitz bands and was headlined by one of Germany's most famous punk bands. The concert came after days of far-right anti-migrant protests took hold of the eastern German city following the death of a 35-year-old German man. Daniel H. was stabbed to death in the early hours of Agust 25, allegedly by a Syrian and an Iraqi national. Punters waved colorful signs with messages of welcome and love as they walked into the concert. The show opened with a minute of silence in honor of Daniel H., while volunteers collected donations to be split between the victim's family and anti-racism initiatives in Chemnitz.

Many members of the CDU, CSU and opposition Free Democrats disagree with a proposal by SPD Environment Minister Svenja Schulze to regulate emitters of carbon dioxide and introduce fees. AKK hasn't committed to the plan. ""CO2 must cost something|"" she told ZDF on Sunday, but added that she had ""not personally determined"" if she would back the environment minister. 'A huge burden' AKK said the SPD must support efforts to install CDU Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen as head of the European Commission. EU leaders nominated von der Leyen after they were unable to agree on the candidacy of CSU MEP Manfred Weber, who the conservative bloc of parties in the European Parliament had proposed for Commission president. ""If Ursula von der Leyen doesn't get the necessary majority in the European Parliament, partly because of the SPD's actions, that would be a huge burden on the work of the government and the coalition|"" she said. Read more: Germany's AKK travels to Israel in first overseas visit as CDU leader The SPD has increasingly lost support after agreeing to back Merkel's governments in 2013 and again in 2017, leaving members divided over whether the party should stay in government or join the opposition to return to power. Many voters have abandoned ship for the Left Party or the Greens. Read more: Most Germans find AKK unfit to replace Angela Merkel, poll finds AKK also said she'd consider sending troops to Syria to fight the Islamic State, as requested by the US envoy for the anti-IS coalition, James Jeffrey, in an interview with the Welt am Sonntag newspaper published on Sunday. Going beyond the Bundeswehr's current mandate — to support the coalition via reconnaissance, refueling and training — which ends in October, could further strain ties with the SPD, which has traditionally expressed skepticism of German military engagements. We start our list with the name that's most difficult for foreigners to pronounce. AKK, as Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer is often known, has taken over from Angela Merkel as head of the Christian Democratic Union and must try to heal divisions between the party's conservative and centrist wings. It's a crucial task, one which may affect whether Merkel sees out the remainder of her term as chancellor. The possible threat to Merkel is down to a new generation of pragmatic, stylish leaders embodied by no one better than Green party co-leader Robert Habeck. His influence has led many people in Germany to talk about conservative-Green coalitions as being the way of the future. Habeck will be instrumental in determining the course the environmentalists choose to take in 2019. Of the four regional elections in 2019, the one in Saxony is arguably the most significant. Saxony has always been a conservative stronghold. The CDU has led every government there since German reunification in 1990. But incumbent State Premier Michael Kretschmer (above right) faces a tough re-election battle, with the CDU polling only around 30 percent. A loss here would have major repercussions. Many Social Democrats are unhappy with the party's ""GroKo"" coalitions with Merkel's conservatives, seeing them as a betrayal of Social Democratic values and a reason for the SPD's precipitous plummet in the polls. The party is scheduled to re-evaluate its current partnership at the end of 2019, so expect to hear a lot from the leader of the No GroKo movement, youth chapter leader Kevin Kühnert. Should the government fall apart, there will be immediate calls for a Jamaica coalition between the conservatives, Greens and the center-right Free Democrats. FDP leader Christian Lindner scuppered that idea in late 2017 after the last election, but has indicated he would be receptive to a tripartite political alliance if Merkel were no longer chancellor. He may play kingmaker in late 2019. Another key regional election is in Thuringia, where incumbent Bodo Ramelow is the first and only state premier to come from the Left party, the successor to the socialist party in Communist East Germany. Whether he can fend off challenges from traditional conservatives and far-right populists will say a lot about the future of leftist parties in the economically lagging eastern part of Germany. The German presidency is largely ceremonial, but when the parties are having trouble forming a government the president springs into action as a mediator. Frank-Walter Steinmeier did this after Merkel struggled to form a coalition following the 2017 election. Should the government break down in late 2019, the pragmatic SPD man and former German foreign minister would be called on again. The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party heads into 2019 with some of the wind taken out of its sails after the anti-immigration populists were overtaken by the Greens in popularity. The Saxony regional election on September 1 represents the best chance for the AfD to regain lost momentum, and the party hopes regional chairman Jörg Urban can lead them to an outright victory. Manfred Weber is not only leader of the conservative European People's Party (EPP) bloc in the European Parliament; he's also the EPP's candidate for the European Commission presidency in the European election in late May, making him the favorite to replace Jean-Claude Juncker. A smooth political operator, Weber would be the first German to hold Europe's highest political office since 1967. He's 33, staunchly conservative, social-media savvy, Polish-born and the new operational head of Merkel's conservative Christian Democratic Union. His election as CDU general secretary reflects both the party's diversity and its desire to freshen up and have a counterweight to the centrists Merkel and Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer.

"a-49438399"|"https://www.dw.com/en/germany-extends-holocaust-compensation-to-include-survivor-spouses/a-49438399"|"Rebecca Staudenmaier"|"The spouses of Holocaust survivors who have passed away will now be able to receive compensation payments from the German government, according to the organization that handles claims for Jewish Holocaust survivors. The New York-based Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany released a statement on Monday, saying that Berlin agreed to continue paying a pension to the surviving spouse for up to nine months after their partner's death. A total of 30,000 people are expected to qualify, with some 14,000 spouses expected to be granted the payment retroactively, Claims Conference negotiator Greg Schneider told the Associated Press. ""We have survivors who have been just getting by for many years|"" Schneider said. ""This extra nine months of income gives a cushion for the family of the survivor to figure out how to deal with their new circumstances|"" he added. Previously, the compensation payments were halted when the Holocaust survivor died, which often left their spouse without a major source of income. Since 1952, the German government has paid over $80 billion (€71 billion) in pensions and social welfare payments to Jews who suffered under the Nazi regime. A huge field of stelae in the center of the German capital was designed by New York architect Peter Eisenmann. The almost 3,000 stone blocks commemorate the six million Jewish people from all over Europe who were murdered by the National Socialists. Designed by German artist Gunther Demnig, these brass plates are very small — only 10 by 10 centimeters (3.9 x 3.9 inches). The stumbling stones mark the homes and offices from which people were deported by the Nazis. More than 7,000 of them have been placed across Berlin, 70,000 across Europe, and in 2017 the first stones were also laid in outside Europe, in Buenos Aires. Fifteen high-ranking Nazi officials met in this villa on the Wannsee Lake on January 20, 1942 to discuss the systematic murder of European Jews, which they termed the ""Final Solution to the Jewish Question"". Today the house is a memorial that informs visitors about the unimaginable dimension of the genocide that was decided here. White roses on track 17 at Grunewald station remember the more than 50,000 Berlin Jews who were sent to their deaths from here. 186 steel plates show the date, destination and number of deportees. The first train went to the Litzmannstadt ghetto (Lodz, Poland) on October 18, 1941; the last train to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp on January 5, 1945. Today, the Hackesche Höfe in Berlin Mitte are mentioned in every travel guide. They are a backyard labyrinth in which many Jewish people lived and worked — for example in the brush factory of the German entrepreneur Otto Weidt. During the Nazi era he employed many blind and deaf Jews and saved them from deportation and death. The workshop of the blind is now a museum. The heart of Berlin's fashion metropolis once beat here. A memorial sign made of high mirrors recalls the Jewish fashion designers and stylists who made clothes for the whole of Europe at Hausvogteiplatz. The National Socialists expropriated the Jewish owners and handed over the fashion stores to Aryan employees. Berlin's fashion center was irretrievably destroyed during the Second World War. Before the Holocaust, 173,000 Jews lived in Berlin; in 1945 there were only 9,000. The monument ""Der verlassene Raum"" (The Deserted Room) is located in the middle of the Koppenplatz residential area in Berlin's Mitte district. It is a reminder of the Jewish citizens who were taken from their homes without warning and never returned. Architect Daniel Libeskind chose a dramatic design: viewed from above, the building looks like a broken Star of David. The Jewish Museum is one of the most visited museums in Berlin, offering an overview of the turbulent centuries of German Jewish history. There are still eight remaining Jewish cemeteries in Berlin, the largest of them in the Weissensee district. With over 115,000 graves, it is the largest Jewish cemetery in Europe. Many persecuted Jews hid in the complex premises during the Nazi era. On May 11, 1945, only three days after the end of the Second World War, the first postwar Jewish funeral service was held here. When the New Synagogue on Oranienburger Strasse was first consecrated in 1866 it was considered the largest and most magnificent synagogue in Germany. The only one of Berlin's 13 synagogues to survive the Kristallnacht pogroms, it later burned down due to Allied bombs. It was reconstructed and opened again in 1995. Since then, the 50-meter-high golden dome once again dominates Berlin's cityscape. Author: Kerstin Schmidt Payments for those who saved Jews In another first, the German government also agreed to pay into the Claims Conference fund for so-called Righteous Gentiles — non-Jews who helped Jewish people survive the Holocaust. Around 277 Righteous Gentiles are still alive today, according to Schneider, adding that many are in need of financial assistance in their old age. The German government also agreed to give an additional €44 million ($49.7 million) in funding for social welfare services — amounting to a total of €524 million for 2020. Those funds provide financial assistance for some 132,000 Jewish Holocaust survivors around the world, including in-home care for over 78,000 people, the Claims Conference said. ""These increased benefits achieved by the hard work of our negotiations delegation, including additional compensation and greater funding for social services, will help ensure dignity in survivors' final years|"" Claims Conference President Julius Berman said in a statement. ""It remains our moral imperative to keep fighting as long as there are still survivors with us|"" he added.

The Spektr-R stopped responding to ground control in January. Russian space agency Roskosmos could not determine how it lost control of the satellite and formally ended its mission in May. Spektr-RG's launch was postponed twice due to battery issues. Roskosmos said Saturday's launch had gone well. ""Next stage: 3 months after launch — cruise to L2, positioning, calibration and testing, test observations|"" Roskosmos said, referring to the following phases of the mission.

""No telescope has ever taken such a detailed look at the entire sky."" The eROSITA is expected to detect more than 100,000 galaxy clusters in a bid to measure dark energy in the universe. It will be accompanied by a Russian-made instrument, the ART-XC. The Spektr-R and its successor were created to observe black holes and map the cosmos to better understand how the universe is expanding.

More than 200 scientists from 18 countries discovered hundreds of thousands of galaxies that no human has ever seen before. The astronomers created the new map of the northern sky with the radio telescope network LOFAR (Low Frequency Array). The different colors in the radio source B3 0157+406 indicate the presence of large-scale turbulences in the source's magnetic field. Less scientific observers might see faces in the wing-shaped structures. This brightly colored tail belongs to spiral galaxy M106. Researchers believe the flame-looking structures are the result of activity from the galaxy's central supermassive black hole. ""With LOFAR, we want to find out which influence black holes have on the galaxies in which they are located|"" said Marcus Brüggen, an astrophysicist at the University of Hamburg. No, we did not make this nickname up! M51 is known as the ""Whirlpool Galaxy"" among LOFAR-astronomers, and it's not hard to see why. It's between 15 and 35 million light-years away from Earth and has a supermassive black hole at its center as well. This merging galaxy cluster goes by the snappy name of CIZA J2242.8+5301. Among astronomers it's known for its northern arch, dubbed the ""Sausage."" Researchers hope the new LOFAR data will also give them more information on how galaxy clusters evolve. What you see here are supernova explosions in the spiral arms of galaxy IC 342. Pretty awesome, right? ""This is a new window on the universe|"" said Cyril Tasse, an astronomer at the Paris Observatory who was involved in the LOFAR project, said about the newly discovered galaxies. Even LOFAR astronomers will use some trickery to arrive at the most beautiful picture sometimes. For this glittering snapshot, they super-imposed LOFAR images of a galaxy on an optical photo of the night sky. We'd say the effort paid off. The galaxy cluster Abell 1314 is located at a distance of approximately 460 million light-years away from Earth. LOFAR researchers will have mountains of data to look into from Abell 1314 and the roughly 300,000 other galaxies they have now discovered.

"a-49580233"|"https://www.dw.com/en/how-dangerous-is-the-identitarian-movement/a-49580233"|"Peter Hille"|"Speaking by phone from Rostock, Daniel Fiss, the leader of Germany's Identitarian Movement, seems calm and friendly. It's hard to believe this rational sounding man with a north German accent is, in fact, a right-wing extremist. After all, the young student tells me his movement supports the right to asylum, believes in human dignity and the German constitution. And that ""we do not discriminate against anyone based on their ethnicity, religion, sexuality or anything like that."" Fiss (center) said his movement has nothing against people with foreign roots But journalist Andreas Speit, who researched the movement for his book Das Netzwerk der Identitären (The Identitarian Network), said the Identitarians are skilled at concealing their real agenda. ""The Identitarians are keen to portray themselves as a tolerant movement|"" he said, explaining that this runs counter to the cliched image of far-right extremists as violent skinheads clad in black combat boots and wielding baseball bats. Members of the Identitarian Movement neither sound nor look like typical right-wing extremists, but their ideology certainly does. It builds on the notion of ethnopluralism, which according to Speit ""posits that allegedly, every ethnic group has its own historical realm where its distinct culture, traditions and identity emerged."" The Identitarian Movement claims these regions must be preserved and protected. ""But this is faulty reasoning, as it assumes that homogeneous societies exist in the first place|"" said Speit. ""In reality, constant interaction has allowed humankind to progress."" Read more: Far-right Identitarians want to become guardians for refugees Send Facebook Twitter google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/2f8NH Ambiguity with a purpose The Identitarian Movement has been active in Germany since 2012. The group currently has only about 600 members, but they're trying to compensate for this with elaborately staged protests and events. The group first came to national prominence in 2016 when activists occupied the Brandenburg Gate and unrolled huge anti-refugee banners. According to Identitarian ideology, the notion of ethnopluralism creates the need for remigration, a term that refers to the idea that migrants, as well as nationals with foreign roots, should be sent back to their ""home countries."" ""In this respect, they are remorseless|"" said Speit. ""They unequivocally state that anyone who is not of German descent should not be in this country."" Read more: Far-right sticker in German police car raises racism concerns I asked Fiss whether this means they want anyone of Turkish descent holding a German passport to be returned to Turkey. ""Not necessarily|"" he replied, before going on to assure me that his movement has nothing against people with foreign roots. This ambiguity is a ""discursive tactics of the Identitarians|"" said Speit. ""They know what they should say, and when, and in which circumstances, in order to be perceived as moderate."" Otherwise, he added, their radical positions would be plain to see. ""For example, they have for the most part held back on commenting on the question of how migrants should be returned home. Should they be shipped off in trains?"" Identitarians scaled the Brandenburg Gate in 2016 and unfurled banners calling for 'secure borders' 'No tolerance for extremists' Extreme right-wing ideology, slickly packaged in a way to make the ideas socially acceptable — that's what makes the Identitarian Movement so dangerous. For that reason, the German domestic intelligence agency (BfV) decided on Thursday to step up its observation of the far-right group and classify it as ""a verified extreme-right movement."" After two years of investigations, the BfV found that the group's views were not compatible with the German constitution. ""We must not only focus on those extremists with violent tendencies, but also keep an eye on those people who stoke fire with words|"" said BfV President Thomas Haldenwang. He said the Identitarians were questioning equality and human dignity, and deliberately making foreigners out to be the enemy. ""There must be no tolerance for extremists."" The classification of the Identitarians as an extreme right-wing group now enables the BfV to monitor them using secret surveillance methods, and also infiltrate their ranks with undercover investigators. Speit thinks this latest step will be a stumbling block for the movement. ""This marks a societal limit. Some followers will see the classification and think twice about whether they really back the group's views|"" he said. In addition, supporters of other right-wing groups may now hesitate when deciding whether to work together with the Identitarians. Send Facebook Twitter google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/3GcRm The far-right political group, Alternative for Germany (AfD), officially decided back in June 2016 that it wouldn't cooperate with the Identitarian Movement. But this demarcation line hasn't always been so strict: for several months earlier this year, from March to May, Identitarian head Fiss had a part-time job at the Bundestag —working in the office of AfD parliamentarian Siegbert Droese. In the German-speaking world, Austrian Martin Sellner is seen as the most influential leader in the Identitarian Movement. He is currently being investigated for suspected involvement in a terrorist group, for his earlier contact with an Australian right-wing extremist allegedly responsible for the Christchurch mosque attacks in March. ""If we look at Sellner's words, the explicit relationship between the Identitarian Movement and violence is clear|"" said Speit. In training videos, followers can often be seen boxing and practicing combat exercises. In the eastern German city of Halle, where the Identitarians have set up a ""housing project|"" they attacked two police officers with baseball bats and pepper spray in November 2017, apparently mistaking the officers for left-wing extremists. Co-chairman Alexander Gauland said the German national soccer team's defender Jerome Boateng might be appreciated for his performance on the pitch - but people would not want ""someone like Boateng as a neighbor."" He also argued Germany should close its borders and said of an image showing a drowned refugee child: ""We can't be blackmailed by children's eyes."" Alice Weidel generally plays the role of ""voice of reason"" for the far-right populists, but she, too, is hardly immune to verbal miscues. Welt newspaper, for instance, published a 2013 memo allegedly from Weidel in which she called German politicians ""pigs"" and ""puppets of the victorious powers in World War II. Weidel initially claimed the mail was fake, but now admits its authenticity. German border police should shoot at refugees entering the country illegally, the former co-chair of the AfD told a regional newspaper in 2016. Officers must ""use firearms if necessary"" to ""prevent illegal border crossings."" Communist East German leader Erich Honecker was the last German politician who condoned shooting at the border. The head of the AfD in the state of Thuringia made headlines for referring to Berlin's Holocaust memorial as a ""monument of shame"" and calling on the country to stop atoning for its Nazi past. The comments came just as Germany enters an important election year - leading AfD members moved to expel Höcke for his remarks. Initially, the AfD campaigned against the euro and bailouts - but that quickly turned into anti-immigrant rhetoric. ""People who won't accept STOP at our borders are attackers|"" the European lawmaker said. ""And we have to defend ourselves against attackers."" Pretzell, former chairman of the AfD in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia and husband to Frauke Petry, wrote ""These are Merkel's dead|"" shortly after news broke of the deadly attack on the Berlin Christmas market in December 2016. The member of parliament in Germany's eastern state of Saxony made waves in early 2016 with an inquiry into how far the state covers the cost of sterilizing unaccompanied refugee minors. Thousands of unaccompanied minors have sought asylum in Germany, according to the Federal Association for Unaccompanied Minor Refugees (BumF) - the vast majority of them young men. Poggenburg, head of the AfD in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt, has also raised eyebrows with extreme remarks. In February 2017, he urged other lawmakers in the state parliament to join measures against the extreme left-wing in order to ""get rid of, once and for all, this rank growth on the German racial corpus"" - the latter term clearly derived from Nazi terminology. During a campaign speech in Eichsfeld in August 2017, AfD election co-candidate Alexander Gauland said that Social Democrat parliamentarian Aydan Özoguz should be ""disposed of"" back to Anatolia. The German term, ""entsorgen|"" raised obvious parallels to the imprisonment and killings of Jews and prisoners of war under the Nazis. Gauland was roundly criticized for a speech he made to the AfD's youth wing in June 2018. Acknowledging Germany's responsibility for the crimes of the Nazi era, he went on to say Germany had a ""glorious history and one that lasted a lot longer than those damned 12 years. Hitler and the Nazis are just a speck of bird shit in over 1,000 years of successful German history.""

Even the most trivial details — such as my address, my job or my age — must not be disclosed to third parties without my consent. For politicians, however, an entirely different set of rules applies, Germany included. Politicians have to put up with anything (like a close inspection of the footnotes of their university dissertation) and publicly disclose everything (like every last cent of any additional incomes). And if they happen to have a health problem, many in the media would appreciate if the Federal Press Office sent out a medical bulletin containing a comprehensive blood analysis. But as long as this last option isn't standard procedure, charlatans of all kinds are free to submit diagnoses from afar, even if they're utterly and completely detached from reality.

But that's not the case. ""I am doing well|"" Angela Merkel said this week, after a third bout of public tremors. The trouble is, hardly anyone believes her, because everyone has seen those video clips. Images of the chancellor shaking as she stands next to the new Ukrainian president in mid-June, then during a welcome ceremony for the new justice minister a week later and then this week at a public reception for the Finnish prime minister. What, for God's sake, was all that about? Merkel isn't the first German head of government to suffer from health problems. Willy Brandt, chancellor of West Germany from 1969 to 1974, would suffer from depression and, as a result, was at times unable to make decisions. His successor, Helmut Schmidt, lost consciousness almost 100 times during his tenure from 1974 to 1982. That includes a fainting spell at the Elysee Palace in Paris. The difference between then and now is simply that no one took notice at the time. Journalists, even if they had witnessed such events, never published images of ailing politicians. It was Schmidt himself who went public with those delicate details — at age 95, one year before his death in 2015. Merkel entitled to privacy So now Germany has a chancellor who, whenever she deems it appropriate, remains seated during the national anthem. Is that cause for concern? If Wolfgang Schäuble, widely regarded as likely successor to longtime Chancellor Helmut Kohl and left paralyzed in the wake of a 1990 assassination attempt, had become head of government instead of Merkel, Germans would have long been familiar with the sight by now. ""Apart from that, I'm deeply convinced that I'm able to effectively perform my job."" Germans will have to accept Merkel's statement from Wednesday as reassurance for the time being. Is that a problem? No, because the chancellor, too, is entitled to a privilege all other Germans claim for themselves: the right to privacy.

They come for the diverse venues, the quality of the music, the special free atmosphere. Yet, 30 years after the techno scene awakened at the first Love Parade, Berlin club culture is increasingly coming under threat. Among those sounding a warning is one of the world's most prominent DJs and techno producers, Zak Khutoretsky, better known as DVS1. An American with Russian roots who considers Berlin to be his second home, Khutoretsky regularly performs at Berghain, still the most revered techno club in the world. But DVS1 sees a Berlin techno community now struggling for survival. ""At a certain point the bubble will burst|"" he told DW. ""Either you find a solution or the whole thing goes down the drain."" Techno DJ DVS1 is concerned that a thriving club scene is coming under threat Berlin's endangered clubs The DJ's concerns have many potential origins. Are techno tourists destroying the character of Berlin clubs that are falling victim to the global hype? Or are big property investors driving the clubs out of their longstanding locations? Perhaps it's the gentrification that goes hand-in-hand with increasingly unaffordable rents? Or local residents' complaints about noise pollution that have forced some venues to close? Read more: A visit to Cologne's Bootshaus, Germany's top club Of the estimated 100 techno clubs in Berlin, four folded last year, according to the Club Commission of the Berlin Senate. Another nine clubs are considered to be endangered. These include Griessmühle in the south of the city, founded by David Ciura eight years ago. The 30-year-old today can point to a proud record. As it often goes in Berlin, it began with a few people's desire to express themselves in glorious isolation. The grounds of the Griessmühle, a vast former pasta factory, seemed the ideal place to do so. The club now organizes 150 parties a year, employs 70 people and its annual turnover of €2.1 million ($2.4 million) euros continues to rise steeply. Ciura's parties, especially his monthly CockTail d'Amore, have hit a nerve with techno fans. Berlin's KitKatCub is one of 100 techno clubs in Berlin that face testing times But what hardly anyone knows is that Ciura never gets more than half-yearly contracts, making planning difficult. Currently, his rental contract has only been extended until the beginning of 2020. And this is no isolated case in Berlin. The famous Tresor club, for example, is said to have only received rental agreements for a period of three months. ""Long-term leases are no longer available in the inner city ring|"" complains Ciura, who speaks of the ongoing ""fear of being thrown out."" That could happen, for example, if an investor offered so much money for the Griessmuehle location that the owner of the site decided to sell. Fight for the right to party According to Ciura, the techno clubs have helped pull Berlin out of its slumber over the last decade ""And now, after such a short time, it would be a pity to have to sacrifice it all|"" he says. If it were up to Ciura, the Berlin Senate should send a clear message of support for the city's club culture — and not only back prestigous projects such as the €600 million ($680 million) reconstruction of the Berlin City Palace. David Cezar Ciura typically manages Griessmuehle on very short-term rental contracts ""I think it is imperative to fight for every square meter for culture events, for open space in this city, to fight for every club|"" Berlin culture senator Klaus Lederer told DW. But politicians have reacted far too late, he added in a critique of his predecessors. Lederer admits that politicians can do little to fight against the power and influence of billion-dollar investors. At the very least, the Senate now supports the clubs with subsidies for noise reduction measures. But this alone will hardly be enough to ensure the clubs' survival. There's a lot at stake: Berlin arguably possesses the world's most distinctive and lively club scene, not only because of legendary headline clubs such as Berghain, Tresor and Watergate, but also due to the constant emergence of new clubs — some of which spring up illegally.

""In Berlin, you can be freer than anywhere else in the world|"" Ciura gushes. ""It's about people's freedom to feel the way they want, to escape from their office jobs, to open up and simply enjoy their lives|"" adds DVS1. This includes the freedom of the DJ's to play their sets without commercial constraints.

Such freedom extends to the dreaded bouncers who sometimes deny visitors access to the club, which DVS1 believes is also necessary to preserve Berghain's underground bona fides. But Berghain is in a league of its own. The question remains whether other clubs can sustain their character, and economic existence, despite the many threats.

During the new Danish prime minister's visit to Berlin on Thursday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her guest, Mette Frederiksen, were seated in chairs. Merkel sat calmly through military honors and listened to both countries' national anthems without shaking. On Wednesday, Merkel, 64, suffered a third bout of shaking within the space of a few weeks while standing in the courtyard at the Chancellery. But, before long, she seemed her usual self again — the chancellor whom many have long come to know: calm, matter-of-fact, emotionally restrained but with a slight smile. ""I am doing well|"" Merkel said just an hour after she was seen shaking uncontrollably again. ""As I have recently said, since the military honors with [Ukrainian President] Volodymyr Zelenskiy, I have been in a processing phase. That is apparently not yet completely finished, but progress has been made. And I have to live with it for a while now. I am fine."" Is the chancellor unwell? Is she running out of steam? The day following the latest shaking spell, the front page of Germany's mass-circulation Bild newspaper read: ""It just doesn't stop."" 'It just doesn't stop' read the headline of the Bild newspaper Merkel's health began making headlines after she was seen shaking during a reception for Zelenskiy in mid-June in the courtyard of the Chancellery. But, nine days later during a farewell ceremony for the departing justice minister, Merkel was seen shaking again — this time holding her hands in front of her body. But, once moving, she was back to normal. Case of dehydration? For the incident beside the Ukrainian president, the official line was that Merkel was not sufficiently hydrated. Indeed, temperatures in Berlin were scorching that day. After the second spell, German media reported that the shaking might possibly be psychological. Though health issues are a fact of life, German politicians have long treated them as if they were state secrets. Only a few minutes before Merkel publicly commented that she had to live with the occasional shaking, her spokesperson, Ulrike Demmer, went on a reassurance offensive, emphasizing that all is well with the chancellor: ""In the past three weeks, she not only attended all appointments but also made great achievements."" And this is true, Merkel has not canceled a single meeting, and she negotiated well into the night at the G20 summit in Japan after having declared that ""I am fine!"" Read more: What causes uncontrollable cramps or shaking? Germany: Unaccustomed to leaders falling ill The resulting frank discussions on how the chancellor is faring and the fact that Merkel is taking a stand in openly addressing her health are signs of an evolving German political landscape. In the past, reporting on the health of chancellors has been the exception rather than the norm. In the 1970s, Chancellor Willy Brandt, of the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), experienced long periods of depression unbeknownst to the public. Similarly, in 1989, shortly before the fall of the Berlin Wall, Chancellor Helmut Kohl survived an attempt by his fellow Christian Democrats to oust him at a party conference while he was in excruciating pain from a prostate illness. No one knew that Kohl was unwell at the time. Evidently these chancellors knew what they were doing: Germans, who view dependability as a great asset in politicians, do not like it when their leaders show signs of weakness. And, usually, they do not want to know about it either. Send Facebook Twitter google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/3Lr2a Politicians in Germany are also afforded more privacy than in other democracies where the topic of leaders' health is dealt with differently. In France, it is not improper to discuss the president's health; likewise, in the US, the press even reports on the president's bloodwork. But that level of transparency hasn't always been the norm. Presidents such as Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy were seriously ill while in office, but the public were provided few, if any details. Changing times The way that the illnesses of public figures are viewed is changing in Germany, and certain individuals have contributed to this shift. The popular Social Democratic state premier of Rhineland-Palatinate, Malu Dreyer, has always been open about her battle with multiple sclerosis. In the more strictly controlled states around the world, this topic becomes difficult. Dictators and autocrats rarely fall ill — at least not officially. Instead, images such as those of Russian President Vladimir Putin riding a horse shirtless through the wilderness reinforce the perception of a strong leader. Merkel has since diffused some of the drama surrounding her health, telling reporters: ""You don't have to worry about me."" In doing so, she's set about getting on with it."|"When Angela Merkel shakes, the whole of Germany worries.

Miners have worked in Erzgebirge silver mines since the 12th century. Radioactive uranium was also mined there until the early 1990s. The mountain range is known as the Krusnohori in Czech and the Ore Mountains in English. The area grew rich through the extraction of ore, and became a center for the study of mining technology. Famed German polymath Alexander von Humboldt was among those who studied at the Freiberg School of Mines, which was founded in 1765. On graduation, Humboldt provided an expert opinion on the drainage of mining tunnels — just one of many studies that helped change the industry. ""The Saxonian-Bohemian Erzgebirge has served as an impulse generator for the economic and social development in mining regions of the whole continent|"" said Germany's UNESCO Commission chief Maria Böhmer after the organization granted the request. This 16th-century town in the Czech Republic is not just a birthplace of mining and metallurgy science — it also has a rather shiny history. The first official 'Joachimsthaler' — large silver coins — were produced here at the royal mint (picture) in 1520. These 'Thaler' were used as currency over hundreds of years in Europe. The legacy still lives on today — it's how the dollar got its name. Near Jachymov is an industrial site with a dark history. From 1951-1956, this striking red-brick tower and the surrounding area was used to process uranium ore, before being sent to the Soviet Union. It was also part of a forced labor camp for hundreds of political prisoners. Today, this national cultural monument in the Czech Republic serves as a grave reminder to those who suffered here. First used as a grain mill in the 15th century, the Frohnauer Hammer was converted to forge silver in 1621. As the technology developed, the water-powered mill was used to forge copper and iron until the early 20th century. As Germany's oldest blacksmith museum, established in 1910, it is one of the region's most popular tourist destinations. Towering at almost 30 meters (98 ft), these basalt columns in southeastern Saxony serve as a striking backdrop to the mountain town below. Known locally as the 'organ pipes', they were formed millions of years ago, as lava cooled. Around 1800, scientists and scholars took particular interest in these geological formations, as they were debating the formation of the earth and its deposits. After the discovery of rich silver deposits in the area, the mining town of Marienberg came to life in 1521. As this bird's-eye view of the historic town shows, the city was built according to a square plan with a prominent marketplace measuring 1.8 hectares (2.5 acres). Houses surrounding the square and the nearby town hall both prominently feature renaissance style portals. Mining took place on both sides of the German-Czech border in the Tiefen-Bünau-Stollen (picture). This mining area in Altenberg-Zinnwald represents over 600 years of extracting and processing tin ore — amounting to more than 100,000 tonnes! If you're interested in experiencing a mine firsthand, look no further. Since 1992, this 17th-century tunnel and others in the area have been open to visitors. To some, like the noble family of Bünau, the mining industry brought significant wealth. In fact, their relationship to mining is literally set in stone — in the form of an intricate 4-story sandstone altar in the shape of a pyramid. Paid for by their tin and iron ore mining profits, the epitaph depicts the family in lifesize and is decorated with valuable minerals like alabaster and jasper. Over the course of 5.5 kilometers (3.4 mi) the late 14th-century Röhrgraben winds its way through forests and fields. This man-made water channel — used to supply mining machinery like tin works with power — is considered one of the oldest of its kind in the Erzgebirge region. It even supplied power for tin preparation in Ehrenfriedersdorf up until 1990! Author: Evan Woodnorth ""As trained miners moved away, their knowledge was exported. Administrative structures and financial systems that were established in the Erzgebirge had a significant influence on mining operations all over Europe.""

Despite a balaclava, black gloves, zipped-up anorak, and an artificially distorted voice, it didn't take long for antifascist research organization Exif to identify the man they believed was standing in some greenery in the video: Robin Schmiemann. The disguised man believed to be Schmiemann, a leading figure of the group, read out a declaration saying that Combat 18 felt obliged to go public ""due to recent incidents and the media's cannibalizing of our name for the sole purpose of increasing circulation."" ""Germany has arrived at the point where every citizen is forced to protect himself and his family alone|"" he says. ""The citizens' trust in politicians, judiciary, and the media has been completely destroyed."" Schmiemann spent eight years in jail for shooting a Tunisian-born man during an armed robbery in Dortmund, and while behind bars exchanged letters with Beate Zschäpe, a convicted member of the neo-Nazi terrorist cell the National Socialist Underground (NSU). Stephan E. is suspected of murdering pro-migrant politician Walter Lübcke in his garden For some researchers, the fact that the video appeared at all shows that Combat 18 has been rattled by the attention created by the killing of politician Walter Lübcke. Since it emerged that the main suspect, Stephan E., had ties to the group, Germany's Interior Ministry has been under new pressure to outlaw what is considered a terrorist organization. In June, for example, Canada revised its list of terrorist organizations to include Combat 18. Out of sight, but not quite ""The video is new. This group doesn't really communicate in this form|"" said Hendrik Puls, researcher of the far-right scene and an academic advisor to the NSU investigative committee established by the state parliament of North Rhine-Westphalia. ""That shows they feel they're under pressure at the moment because of the new information about the Lübcke case."" For Puls, there is more evidence that Combat 18 is worried about state attention in the fact that one avowed neo-Nazi, Karsten H., came to police of his own accord to identify himself in a photo of a Combat 18 meeting taken in March in the town of Mücka, Saxony. German public broadcaster ARD had previously identified one individual in the photo as Stephan E. The fact that Karsten H. came forward to clear up the misidentification suggests that Combat 18 are keen to disassociate itself from Stephan E. Send Facebook Twitter google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/34Qxw But there is plenty of other evidence indicating that Stephan E. had contact with the group. A photo taken in 2002, also uncovered by Exif, shows the suspect with Stanley Röske, a man known to Germany's domestic security agency as a leading member of Combat 18. Exif has also published what it says are the statements of a bank account run by Röske, which show the monthly C18 membership fees. Read more: Germany records uptick in far-right violence An international network Despite its long history, it is hard to establish facts about Combat 18. It doesn't appear to be a large group. Exif has identified around 50 members, though the power structures among them largely remain a mystery. ""They are certainly armed, and they boast about it|"" said Axel Salheiser, of the center for far-right research at the University of Jena. ""It's a conspiratorial circle, but it's more of a network than a single organization."" The genesis of the group is well-known to observers of Europe's far-right scene. Founded in the UK in the early 1990s (""18"" is code for AH, or Adolf Hitler), Combat 18 took over control of another neo-Nazi network, Blood & Honour, in the mid-1990s. The latter group was then already an international network, with branches in Germany, the US, and elsewhere. Combat 18 spread with the help of this pre-existing network, and according to Exif, there are now at least 21 Combat 18 branches around the world, including in Brazil, Chile, Russia, the US, as well as throughout Europe, all identified by a common ""coat of arms"": a white dragon on the countries' respective national colors. There is much to suggest that the group is careful about its membership. ""It's certainly an elite circle; you can't easily become a member|"" Puls told DW, adding that what distinguishes Combat 18 from other neo-Nazi organizations is that it has always been associated with propagating armed struggle. A list of internal ""directives|"" also unearthed by Exif, suggests that potential members must undergo a six-month trial period to enter the group. Once approved by their neo-Nazi peers, they must pay a monthly membership fee of €15 ($17) ""as emergency money (e.g. for the arrest of a brother)|"" wear specific clothes at meetings (a C18 t-shirt or jacket, black trousers, black shoes), and swear ""absolute silence"" on the group's internal affairs. But all these details must be treated with caution. For his part, Salheiser wonders whether some of the information uncovered by Exif and other research organizations might not be propaganda ""to confuse opponents and investigative authorities."" ""It's very difficult to tell|"" he said. ""We have very little knowledge."" Read more: Neo-Nazi doomsday prepper network 'made kill lists' Send Facebook Twitter google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/348Nz 'Leaderless resistance' But the general activities of the group are relatively clear. As Puls explains, Combat 18 pursues two main activities: on the one hand, it administers what could be described as the neo-Nazi ""music business|"" (mainly organizing rock concerts which double as mass gatherings) while on the other it propagates ""leaderless resistance."" The concept of leaderless resistance is desribed in a number of neo-Nazi documents, many freely available online. ""The strategy of leaderless resistance is that you don't create a hierarchical terror organization, where there is a command structure that passes down orders to people that carry out attacks|"" said Puls. ""Instead, the concept is that you found very small cells that are detached from one another, and they activate without coordinating with each other, and without waiting for orders."" These cells are also not supposed to claim responsibility for these attacks. ""They don't say: 'we did it,' they just kill migrants. That is Combat 18 ideology, and they set it down in writing, in the form of instructions for guerilla warfare, and distribute it|"" said Salheiser. A 'honeypot' to attract the like-minded? Given all these insights, it's a puzzle why Combat 18 remained legal in Germany, while Blood & Honour was outlawed in 2000. Combat 18 was considered by many the more militant arm of B&H, with countless videos of members brandishing guns in circulation. ""It's basically an absurd story, the question of the ban [not being applied to Combat 18 as well]|"" said Puls. ""It's absurd because since its foundation, Combat 18 has described itself as the armed wing of Blood & Honour."" Exif suspects that Combat 18 has been kept legal to act as a ""honeypot"" to attract other neo-Nazis, and that the entire organization, perhaps including its leadership level, is riddled with state-paid informants. But Salheiser is skeptical about this idea, and believes that the informant network kept by Germany's domestic intelligence agency, the BfV, is simply not very effective. ""They could neither prevent crimes being committed by people in these circles, or get us exact knowledge of who we are dealing with or, for example, how big the membership is|"" he said. Either way, the German government is now apparently preparing to outlaw the group, something many say it should have done decades ago. Nine of the 10 victims were of foreign heritage, but they had all made Germany their home when they were killed. The 10th victim was a German police officer. Every one of them was shot in cold blood. On September 9, 2000, the florist Enver Simsek, pictured with his wife, was shot eight times. The 38-year-old father of two sold flowers near a small parking lot in the southern city of Nuremberg. Simsek, who migrated from Turkey to Germany in 1986, is believed to be the first murder victim in the NSU series of racially motivated killings. Also in Nuremberg, Turkish-born tailor Abdurrahim Ozudogru was shot on June 13, 2001 in his alteration shop. He was 49 years old with a daughter who was 19 at the time of his murder. Later that month, on June 27, 2001 Suleyman Taskopru was shot dead in his father's fruit and vegetable shop in Hamburg. He was 31 years old and had a three-year-old daughter. On August 29 of the same year, 38-year-old Habil Kilic, who was also a fruit and vegetable grocer, was killed in his shop in Munich. Like Taskopru, he was shot in the head. His wife and his 12-year-old daughter later left Germany. Mehmet Turgut lived in Hamburg, but was visiting a friend in the eastern German city of Rostock and helping out at a Doner kebab fast food restaurant when he was shot on February 25, 2004. He was killed by three bullets to the head. Ismail Yasar was shot five times in his doner kebab restaurant in Nuremberg on June 9, 2005. A customer found him behind the counter. The 50-year-old had three children. Just a few days later, on June 15, 2005, Theodoros Boulgarides was shot dead in Munich in his lock and key service shop. He was the only victim with Greek heritage. The 41-year-old father of two was the NSU's seventh murder victim. On a busy street at noon on April 4, 2006 in the western city of Dortmund, Turkish-born Mehmet Kubasik was killed by several shots to the head in his small convenience store. The 39-year-old left behind a wife and three children. In Kassel on April 6, 2006, Halit Yozgat was also shot in the head. He was killed in the internet cafe he ran with his father. Twenty-one years old, Turkish-born but with a German passport, Yozgat was taking night school classes to graduate from high school. Michele Kiesewetter, a 22-year-old police officer, was shot dead on April 25, 2007 in the southwestern city of Heilbronn. She was the NSU's 10th and final murder victim.

"a-49516665"|"https://www.dw.com/en/is-socialism-the-future-for-germanys-ailing-spd/a-49516665"|"Austin Davis"|"Silence falls over Munich's Alte Kongresshalle as Kevin Kühnert, the 29-year-old leader of the Young Socialists (Jusos), takes the stage to deliver his keynote address to hundreds of wide-eyed teens and young adults. Sporting his trademark untucked shirt and sneakers, Kühnert opens by drawing parallels between today's Jusos congress and the one that took place in this very hall 50 years ago. In 1969, at a time of civil unrest, his predecessors transformed an insignificant youth organization within the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) into an unapologetic socialist force that would help shape the party's political agenda for the next decade. It helped usher in an era of SPD dominance led by former Chancellors Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt — a period largely seen as the golden age of the SPD in Germany. Past is now present, Kühnert stresses during the congress last Friday. Just like back then, the SPD finds itself in the throes of an identity crisis after a decade of electoral setbacks and rubbing shoulders with conservatives. The exact circumstances may be different, but he believes the path forward is very much the same: Democratic socialism and a return to grassroots politics. ""People like to accuse us of unrealistic, fantastic views — they say our heads are in the clouds|"" Kühnert says calmly of his critics. ""They say we're radical."" He grows louder as he lists off the ills of Germany's current political establishment: Inhumane migration policies, the resurgence of right-wing extremism, ignored societal inequality. ""The circumstances in which we're living are radical!"" he proclaims. The hall erupts in applause. One young man whistles as he throws his fist in the air in a show of solidarity. The 60-year-old leads a coalition of the SPD and the Christian Democrats in his northern state. In the Bundesrat — the council of Germany's 16 states and upper house of parliament — he serves on the Committee on Foreign Affairs and is deputy chairman of the Committee on European Affairs. Many in the SPD have long seen him as a possible new hope to lead the party forward. Schwesig, born and raised in the former East Germany, is the first woman to lead the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. The 45-year-old previously served as minister of family affairs under Chancellor Angela Merkel, a role she used to push for equal opportunities for women and better state childcare facilities. She serves on the Bundesrat's Committee on Foreign Affairs. Scholz, 60, is seen by some of his fellow party members as a technocrat and is considered to belong to the SPD's conservative wing. As finance minister under Merkel, he has been committed to curbing public spending and keeping a lid on new debt. He also served as federal minister of labor and social affairs in Merkel's Cabinet from 2007 to 2009. A reasonably popular figure in the SPD, Dreyer was voted in as deputy party chairwoman in 2017 with 97.5% backing. Despite repeatedly stating she would not want to leave her western state for Berlin, she is still seen as a possible replacement for Nahles. The 58-year-old has served as premier of Rhineland-Palatinate since 2013 and is the first woman to hold the office. The 59-year-old Bundestag member from Cologne is one of the deputy chairs of the SPD's parliamentary group. In that role, he is responsible for foreign affairs, defense and human rights policy. He is well respected within the party and could be tapped as interim SPD leader in the Bundestag. The 60-year-old sociologist leads the SPD in Germany's most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia. He is a deputy chair of the SPD's parliamentary group, overseeing budgetary affairs, finance and Europe. As secretary-general of the Party of European Socialists, he is also considered well connected at the European level. The former president of the European Parliament has been suggested as another possible challenger. The 63-year-old ran as the SPD's candidate for chancellor in 2017 but lost to Merkel. He subsequently stepped down as SPD leader. He has already said he doesn't want the job back, but Germany's Bild am Sonntag newspaper reported last week that he was keen to lead the SPD parliamentary group. Socialism on the rise? Such scenes could lead one to believe that excitement for socialism is growing in Germany, especially among young people, many of whom have recently taken to the streets in protest against climate change, the far right and unaffordable housing. Such assumptions wouldn't be far-fetched. The local, SPD-led government in Berlin recently instituted a five-year freeze on rent hikes to pacify unrest and address skyrocketing costs of living in the German capital. From Europe to the United States, there are examples of socialist thinking gaining traction — from the unlikely resonance of Bernie Sanders among many Americans, to the return of social-democratic parties to power in Portugal, Denmark and Spain. But social democracy around the world is actually in an ""existential crisis|"" according to Klaus Dörre, a sociologist at the University of Jena. Unable to answer pressing questions as far-ranging as digitalization and human rights, he says most of these parties focus on electability over substance. The result is a social-democratic party in Denmark that shares views with the far right on immigration, a broad left coalition in Spain held together by a strong personality, and a lamenting SPD in Germany that's often criticized as unrecognizable from longtime German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats. The SPD has spent 10 of the past 14 years in a coalition with Merkel's conservative party. The SPD won only 15.8% of the vote in May's European Parliament elections, is in the middle of its sixth leadership change since 2008 and is currently polling at an anemic 13% nationally, according to the latest figures from German public broadcaster ARD. ""In Germany, the term social democracy has become meaningless|"" says Dörre. Former Chancellor Willy Brandt oversaw much of the Social Democrats' golden era in the 1970s. Longing for the past It wasn't always like this, says Marianne, 85, at a recent barbecue hosted by the local SPD in the Berlin neighborhood of Schöneberg, a party stronghold. Marianne fondly recalls the solidarity she felt among other SPD members in the late 1950s. When she joined her father in the western city of Solingen in 1953, after fleeing communist East Germany, she quickly internalized his priorities: God, career and the SPD. ""We came together for our fellow man, for the poor. We were completely socially minded|"" she explains, loading another cigarette into her long, black holder. ""I felt a duty to stand up for fairness, to support workers and social equality."" Today's SPD is a shell of what it was in those glory days, she says. Under the leadership of former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder from 1998 until 2005, the SPD adopted a conservative course of strict requirements for welfare recipients and business-friendly policies that jaded its traditional base of workers and the unions that represented them. Read more: Germany: SPD's simmering identity crisis erupts Despite much effort, the SPD hasn't been able to shake off those policy choices. Subsequent leaders favored small, technocratic solutions, such as tweaks to Germany's pension scheme and its minimum wage, over broader, socialism-driven visions. They often capitulated to Merkel's conservatives in an era where Germany became Europe's wealthiest nation, and the vast majority of people report that their lives are going well. Those at the helm of the SPD no longer listen to voters' concerns for the future, says Marianne. ""Their heart's no longer in it. They're not even fighting anymore."" The SPD in the 1960s and 1970s remained close to their base of workers and unions. Crisis the catalyst But Michael Biel, chairman of the SPD in Schöneberg, is optimistic about the future of the party he's called home for the last 15 years. Crisis can be a catalyst for the party to return to its roots, especially as industrial automization, an inevitable transition to renewable energies and a growing disparity between rich and poor make progressive thinking much appealing to voters. ""The SPD can no longer sit in closed rooms and talk about itself — we need to open the windows and develop something together that's good for our districts, our neighborhoods and our society|"" he says. Airing out a room that's become too dusty is the thinking behind the current SPD leadership race. Following the untimely resignation of the party's former leader, Andrea Nahles, after the SPD's abysmal results in the European Parliament election, interim leaders announced an open casting call. Candidates must apply as a male-female team, and anyone can throw their hat in the ring until September, at which time candidates will campaign around the country for member support before a final ballot is cast at a convention of party leaders in December. Former SPD leader Nahles resigned shortly after the party's abysmal showing in the European Parliament elections. Kühnert or bust? The search for the Social Democrats' next superstar, however, has been slow-going. Since the gates opened in the leadership race, only one duo — Christina Kampmann, 38, the former minister of family affairs in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, and Michael Roth, a deputy minister in Germany's Foreign Office — have announced they're running. There was also speculation of a run by Kühnert, with his posturing of expropriating large swaths of German housing stock and key German industries. But his unabashed calls for a socialist revival within the SPD would harm, not help, a party struggling to retain voters, says Gero Neugebauer, a political scientist at Berlin's Free University. Indeed, he believes the party's next leader needs to be an outsider, someone with no connection to the SPD's unpopular coalition governments with Merkel, as well as someone who can drive the party to the left. As a figurehead, Kühnert has breathed a lot of life into discussions about the party finding a niche for itself in a new era of German politics, where both the environmentalist Greens and the far-right Alternative for Germany have gained momentum. Experts question whether Kühnert is the type of leadership figure to return the SPD to prominence ""But a figurehead can't steer a ship|"" Neugebauer says. Only 28% of people responded positively to Kühnert's views on socialism, published in a much-discussed interview in German newspaper Die Zeit in May, according to a Civey survey conducted at the time. ""He doesn't have the qualities a party leader needs to represent the majority of some 400,000 [SPD] members — even if about a fourth of those members are Jusos|"" says Neugebauer. So the new-and-improved SPD needs to be socialist, but not radically so. And it needs to be led by an outsider courageous enough to speak out about the tricky issues Germany faces in the future, but someone who has enough experience to house new ideas within the golden palace of the SPD's traditional value set.

It did not say exactly what form such a measure should take, saying that emissions trading and a CO2 tax were both possible. But the council did recommend that the state should return any revenue gained to citizens, possibly as a lump sum or by lowering taxes on electricity. Money from any CO2 tax should also be used directly to help pay for measures aimed at combating climate change, it said. It said that such national measures should be only temporary, with the final goal being an EU-wide extension of carbon pricing to include heating and transport.

Suggestions regarding the pricing of CO2 have, however, previously met with criticism by a number of German politicians, notably from Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative CDU/CSU bloc. They fear that national measures could negatively impact Germany's competitiveness in international markets. On receiving the experts' recommendations, Merkel herself said they were an encouragement ""to go down the market-based path"" rather than relying solely on edicts.

Deutsche Post chief Frank Appel told the Rheinischen Post that if such measures were taken at a European or global level, it would allow companies to strategically invest in limiting CO2 emissions. The German Association of Energy and Water Industries (BDEW) called the council's report a ""very good basis for the decision to introduce CO2 pricing."" However, the environmentalist organization BUND (Friends of the Earth Germany) criticized the recommendations as not concrete enough, saying the council had simply ""reiterated its well-known ideological stance favoring market self-regulation and against state measures.""

In September, the German government intends to finalize measures aimed at ensuring that its 2030 goal of emitting 55% less greenhouse gases than in 1990 is achieved.

The 149-year-old bank has had a miserable time of late. CEO Christian Sewing, who's been at the helm of the lender for about a year now, has decided to subject Deutsche Bank to an emergency operation. Cosmetic improvements won't cut it anymore. The bank logged a profit in 2018 for the first time in three years. It also boasted some earnings in the first quarter of 2019. But the €200 million ($225 million) in the black pales beside the profits booked by Deutsche Bank's rivals — especially in the United States. DW business editor Henrik Böhme In theory, Deutsche Bank could also have logged a profit for the second quarter of 2019, but a huge restructuring offensive will prevent this. The planned layoffs of 18,000 workers in its investment banking division and elsewhere will initially cost a lot of money — up to €7.4 billion, according to the company's own estimates. This means that Deutsche bank will post a €2.8 billion loss for the second quarter. Outsourcing risks Deutsche Bank is unlikely to log a profit for 2019 overall. Shareholders will have to put up with no dividend payments for this year and 2020, but they will be glad not to see another capital increase that would further decrease the value of their shares. In recent years, Deutsche Bank has issued new shares worth €27 billion — to no avail. Sewing, the CEO, has used core capital to finance such activities, but Deutsche Bank, which is still regulated as a systemically important bank, has to provide a lot more of this core capital than other lenders do. At the same time, risky investments are to be outsourced in the form of a ""bad bank."" We're talking about no less than €74 billion in value. Too many questions The lender will part with a large portion of its former investment banking business to keep only the bits that were at least modestly successful. It will withdraw from interest rate product trading as it has failed to hold a candle to Wall Street in this business segment. That's like a permanent demotion to the finance world's second division. Corporate and retail banking are to become the new focus, with Sewing saying that putting customers first again would be like going back to the lender's roots. What then was Deutsche's main focus before, if I may ask? Had employees forgotten who they were supposed to be there for? And, if so, why did it take so long before anyone noticed? What had the members of the supervisory council been doing all along? Sewing has given his team three years. From 2022 on, Deutsche Bank will have had its glamour restored, according to this concept. Excessive costs will have to be drastically reduced, the IT infrastructure will have to be modernized, and the bank will have a much reduced workforce — at least that's the plan. Becoming competitive again is not going to be easy as Germany's savings banks are increasingly boasting successful business operations. Should the European Central Bank continue its zero-interest-rate policy, Deutsche Bank will find it hard to increase profits. Germany's largest lender is making a radical cut — and it's one that has been overdue. The question is whether the management can motivate employees to carry out the necessary reforms. After all, workers have suffered in recent years as several policy changes haven't yielded their desired effects. And customers have to be convinced, too. Just saying everything will be different will not be enough to win back disenchanted clients who have left Deutsche Bank behind.

The UN will deal with the issue in a summit in New York in September, and at the end of the year we'll have another big climate conference, this time in Chile. How can Germany regain its credibility in this process, which has suffered in the last couple of years? Svenja Schulze: People are watching what's being done in Germany, in terms of climate protection. The fact that we as an industrial nation are completely abandoning nuclear energy and coal is being closely watched, also at the European level. Across Europe alone, we have more than 40 coal districts. And there is a large interest in how Germany came to an agreement on how to phase out coal, and who we included in that discussion. Now it's all about following the recommendations of the coal commission for a structure that's sustainable and directed toward the future. Read more: Lofty goals of German 'climate cabinet' met with skepticism ""Why study, if our future is being destroyed?"" This sign features a sentiment shared by increasing numbers of German students, who have joined young people worldwide in using Friday school strikes to call for action on climate change. The movement was inspired by 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who began her protests alone in front of the Swedish parliament in August 2018. With the 2015 Paris climate accord, nearly all of the world's countries committed to limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, preferably 1.5 degrees (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), by 2100. The hope is that this target will prevent the worst effects of climate disasters. Concerned by the dire predictions from climate scientists, more and more people have called for immediate action. Despite urgent warnings, politicians have dragged their heels on important climate decisions. It's become clear that Germany will miss its targets for 2020. Climate protection was an important factor in the European elections in late May, with the Greens winning more than 20% of the vote in Germany alone, more than double previous results. Among 18-24-year-olds, 34% backed the party. Germany's climate movement is fighting on many fronts. In recent years, activists have fought to preserve Hambach Forest in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, building treehouses to prevent the old-growth forest from being felled to make way for the mining of lignite, or brown coal. Energy giant RWE has launched legal action, and police have cleared the camp several times. In September 2018, a few days after the camp was removed again, a court ruling suspended the clearing of the forest until late 2020, after a lawsuit by environmental group BUND. RWE has argued that the forest has to be cut in order to ensure the coal necessary for Germany's electricity supply. Around 50,000 activists celebrated the victory. Protests organized by groups such as Ende Gelände have increasingly been making headlines. Thousands of young activists have come out to staged events, blocking railway tracks used to deliver coal to power plants near Cologne and occupying huge coal excavators, as seen here in the open-pit mine in the east German town of Welzow in 2016. In January 2019, after seven months of negotiations, a coal commission set up by the federal government to work out Germany's plans to phase out coal power released its findings. It recommended that Germany should continue coal mining until 2038, at the latest —far too late for the country to meet the targets of the 2015 Paris climate accord. An increasing number of young people in Germany are demanding that the government find a way to meet the 1.5-degree target. The emerging Fridays for Future movement has been getting support from longtime environmentalists, teachers, academics and parents. They have called for all German coal-fired power plants to be shut down by 2030, and for renewable energy initiatives to be vastly expanded. Author: Gero Rueter On September 20, Germany's ""climate cabinet""will make some important decisions. Three days later Germany will show its commitment in New York at the UN climate summit on an international stage. The UN climate conference in Chile in December will be all about how international trade with CO2 certificates can work. We already have an emissions trading system in the EU, but we have to avoid double counts when it comes to international emissions trade. That's important, for example when it comes to the question of how to deal with rainforests in Brazil. Read more: Climate emergency: New hope, or just empty words? But so far those are only goals, not agreements for fixed projects. What kind of package does Germany need in its portfolio in New York with in order to be credible? Is it enough to say we will phase out coal by 2038? UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has made it very clear that he expects us to not only hold soapbox speeches, but to clearly define how to achieve our goals. And this is what we are preparing for in the ""climate cabinet."" That's where the ministries are currently working on concrete sets of measures for all sectors. Phasing out coal is only one of the measures — albeit a very important one. Send Facebook Twitter google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/3KvFd But that actually shows that citizens are ready to take on more responsibility. Shouldn't politics say more clearly that everyone will have to pay more for climate protection? It's difficult to just say it like that, because there are a lot of people who simply cannot afford that. It's about giving the right incentives and supporting and enabling climate-friendly behavior. Read more: A German village goes it alone on climate protection If I rent an apartment, I can ask the landlord to refurbish the house so that the utilities costs decrease. But there's no leverage for that. That shows that the political framework has to be right. And there needs to be financial relief for those who cannot afford it. That's why it was so important for me when I suggested a CO2 tax, that politicians create a tax that's fair and won't burden people with a small income. That's possible. We have to charge the people who produce a higher carbon footprint more. People with a small apartment and a small car have the lowest carbon footprint. Those are usually also people who don't travel very far. Is that enforceable in Germany? It has to be enforced; I don't even want to think of the alternative. If we don't manage to make a shift, if our CO2 emissions keep being twice as high as the worldwide average, then it will be difficult for us, our environment, but also the economy, which will lag behind new developments.

"a-49534897"|"https://www.dw.com/en/opinion-are-the-good-years-over-for-german-firms/a-49534897"|"Henrik Böhme (tr)"|"A ""profit warning"" is one of the most misleading economic terms in the book. It does not refer to a warning about a profit that a company could make. It is a warning that a company may bring in less or even no profit; and should actually probably be called a ""loss warning."" Semantics aside, such a profit warning came earlier this week from the German chemical group BASF. This is not just any company, but the largest chemical company in the world, with 122,000 employees spread around the globe. If such a company slashed its forecast for the current fiscal year so drastically — namely a drop in profits up to 30% — alarm bells should ring. Why? Because an internationally networked company like BASF that works in so many industries with so many partners and customers is the first to see when things start to go wrong. The automotive industry, for example, orders a lot of its paints and plastics from BASF. This industry in particular has been hit by sagging global growth. An even bigger problem for the chemical conglomerate are trade conflicts. Those who thought that everything would go back to normal after the next tweet by US President Donald Trump now know better. A real solution is not in sight, and the damage is apparently already enormous. If there is something that companies fear more than the tax man, it is uncertainty. DW business editior Henrik Böhme The ""R"" word As for a recession, you can talk about it long enough until it is actually there. But it's not just BASF. Bad news comes out of the German economy practically every day. Orders for German industry continue to decline. The mood in companies is turning into the negative. The Munich-based Institute for Economic Research (ifo), which regularly feels the pulse of companies, had to spread this bad news the other day, garnished with the bad ""R"" word: Manufacturing for export is already in recession, according to the experts. German engineering, which is the second major pillar of the economy next to car manufacturing, is expected to see a drop of 2% in production this year. Yet even before BASF came on the radar this week, other companies showed up with terrible news. Siemens recorded ""unexpectedly weak new orders."" Analysts expect industrial giant ThyssenKrupp to also soon issue a profit warning. At the same time, there are frequent reports of planned redundancies: BASF wants to cut 6,000 jobs. Competitor Bayer has indicated that 12,000 jobs would have to go. The good years apparently seem over at Siemens, ThyssenKrupp and Volkswagen. They are bracing themselves for a big storm that is on the horizon. Back to normal? And now the good news after all the bad: The German job market is in such a robust condition that it can survive the coming waves. The number of applications to reduce working hours, called short-time work, has increased significantly in recent weeks. This means that many companies are only firing people if there is no other way and are trying to do everything they can to hold on to their skilled workers. If skilled workers are fired, they should be able to find something new elsewhere. By the way, short-time work helped the German economy to quickly find its way back on track following the severe recession in 2009 after the economy plummeted by 5% as a result of the global financial crisis. Today the world economy is far from such a dramatic collapse. After years of boom with a partially overheated German economy, we can expect a phase of normalization in the best-case scenario. This includes cycles of upswings and downswings. Really bad news sounds different.

But today's politics lecture was far from ordinary — the lesson was top secret, and held in a high-security building. Luisa is among the first generation of Germans to be enrolled in the Intelligence and Security Studies (MISS) master's degree program, jointly offered by the Federal University of Applied Administrative Sciences and the Bundeswehr University Munich. And, for obvious security reasons, she must keep her surname secret. Before enrolling, Luisa contributed to various branches of Germany's foreign intelligence agency, working with the counterterrorism analysis team, in operations and with the agency's administration. Now, after 10 years of service, she's decided to take part in the MISS program. Read more: Police informants in Germany: Money, attention and scandal ""I enjoy getting a break from my ordinary work and having time to think about different issues|"" she told DW. ""I'm interested in the relationship between our intelligence agencies and German society."" Her degree will include a range of courses, including one dedicated to intelligence analysis and another on cyber intelligence. The MISS degree program is not open to just any applicant. Only individuals employed either by Germany's foreign intelligence agency, the military counterintelligence service, the domestic intelligence service or the armed forces may enroll. Police officers active in these fields, and civil servants working for ministries whose activities pertain to sensitive political and security issues, may also apply. To be admitted, students must undergo a thorough vetting process — as do lecturers. Decorated with steel palm trees, the new BND headquarters sits right where the Berlin Wall used to bisect the city. The move signals a major symbolic change for Germany, no longer shying away from taking a prominent role on the global stage. The limestone and aluminum-fronted complex covers 10 hectares (25 acres) and cost €1.1 billion ($1.25 billion). It is one of the world's largest secret service bases. A huge monolith called ""The Thing"" (Das Ding) adorns the central courtyard of the new headquarters. The work was created by the Düsseldorf-based artist Stefan Sous, whose massive sculptures can be found in public squares thoughout Germany. There are plans to open a visitors center at the new BND headquarters. This marks a massive shift for a populace that has long been suspicious of intelligence agencies, with memories of the Gestapo and the Stasi still alive. ""A healthy distrust is helpful, but being overly suspicious is a hindrance|"" Chancellor Angela Merkel said at the opening. The clock in the situation room shows the time in New York, London, Berlin, Moscow and Beijing. The building itself, however, did not open on time. A series of delays, mishaps and cost overruns. The inauguration in February 2019 came more than 12 years after construction began. Around 4,000 of the BND's 6,500 secret service agents work in the huge new building. Merkel stressed that Germany ""needs a strong and efficient foreign intelligence service more than ever."" International terrorism, global organized crime structures, as well as cybersecurity and nuclear proliferation are among the challenges the BND is looking to target. Author: Elizabeth Schumacher, Rob Turner Sharing insights The degree program was launched in January, with compulsory introductory courses for anyone without prior experience working for a German intelligence agency. Now that these preliminary courses are over, all students have arrived in Berlin where work on the actual master's program will take place. ""The students form a very heterogeneous group|"" said Jan-Hendrik Dietrich, head of the department. ""There are really young students from the armed forces, just 22 or 23 years old. But there are also some from the intelligence agencies, who are very experienced and have worked on the threat posed by the extreme right-wing and left-wing."" Dietrich said these groups enrich the learning experience by sharing their insights. Read more: The German who went from left-wing terrorist to Salafist sympathizer The degree program was developed over the course of four years. Among other things, it aims to improve Germany's various intelligence services; cyberattacks and numerous fact-finding committees on the neo-Nazi National Socialist Underground (NSU) terror cell had revealed a range of serious weaknesses. ""This degree instills a set of values into students from different backgrounds, which can improve cooperation — especially when fighting terrorism|"" said Dietrich. Nine of the 10 victims were of foreign heritage, but they had all made Germany their home when they were killed. The 10th victim was a German police officer. Every one of them was shot in cold blood. On September 9, 2000, the florist Enver Simsek, pictured with his wife, was shot eight times. The 38-year-old father of two sold flowers near a small parking lot in the southern city of Nuremberg. Simsek, who migrated from Turkey to Germany in 1986, is believed to be the first murder victim in the NSU series of racially motivated killings. Also in Nuremberg, Turkish-born tailor Abdurrahim Ozudogru was shot on June 13, 2001 in his alteration shop. He was 49 years old with a daughter who was 19 at the time of his murder. Later that month, on June 27, 2001 Suleyman Taskopru was shot dead in his father's fruit and vegetable shop in Hamburg. He was 31 years old and had a three-year-old daughter. On August 29 of the same year, 38-year-old Habil Kilic, who was also a fruit and vegetable grocer, was killed in his shop in Munich. Like Taskopru, he was shot in the head. His wife and his 12-year-old daughter later left Germany. Mehmet Turgut lived in Hamburg, but was visiting a friend in the eastern German city of Rostock and helping out at a Doner kebab fast food restaurant when he was shot on February 25, 2004. He was killed by three bullets to the head. Ismail Yasar was shot five times in his doner kebab restaurant in Nuremberg on June 9, 2005. A customer found him behind the counter. The 50-year-old had three children. Just a few days later, on June 15, 2005, Theodoros Boulgarides was shot dead in Munich in his lock and key service shop. He was the only victim with Greek heritage. The 41-year-old father of two was the NSU's seventh murder victim. On a busy street at noon on April 4, 2006 in the western city of Dortmund, Turkish-born Mehmet Kubasik was killed by several shots to the head in his small convenience store. The 39-year-old left behind a wife and three children. In Kassel on April 6, 2006, Halit Yozgat was also shot in the head. He was killed in the internet cafe he ran with his father. Twenty-one years old, Turkish-born but with a German passport, Yozgat was taking night school classes to graduate from high school. Michele Kiesewetter, a 22-year-old police officer, was shot dead on April 25, 2007 in the southwestern city of Heilbronn. She was the NSU's 10th and final murder victim. Author: Iveta Ondruskova Promoting inter-agency cooperation Dietrich and his colleagues relied on international experts to help draw up the program. US and UK universities, after all, have been offering degree programs aimed at intelligence agency staff for decades. Their purpose is to build up a close-knit intelligence community and foster collaboration among different agencies. ""We want to train a cohort of critically thinking, reflective leaders, not yes-men who simply report what the government wants to hear|"" said Dietrich. Once students have completed the degree, Dietrich said they will be able to put their new skill sets to use and promote inter-agency cooperation. Despite her previous experience, Luisa said the degree program's focus on cybersecurity has broadened her horizon. ""I have little experience working in this area, so it's really useful understanding how data used for analysis is generated.” After graduating in two years, she will return to the foreign intelligence agency and be part of Germany's brand new intelligence community. ""So far, I've been a generalist, and that is what I will continue to be — though I will have a different position, and carry greater responsibility.""

It may well be that it's not always able to fully control everything, and may not even be that interested in issues of little political relevance. But this certainly is not the case for Huawei, a company poised to invest billions in Europe to build up its 5G network by installing delicate, high-end technology that will have serious security ramifications. It is hard to believe that German or other European tech companies are unable to roll out a 5G network on their own. Sure, it may take a little longer to develop that capacity domestically, but German engineering is world-renowned for a reason. Good business relations build on mutual satisfaction. But if China continues to block the free flow of information, liberal democratic societies such as our own cannot be satisfied.

So far, just a few million euros have been injected into the scheme— a virtual ledger for EU companies to offset balances, allowing them to exchange goods with Iran without direct transfers of money.

Send Facebook Twitter google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/3D7CF He said that Brussels which normally bows to US pressure would do well to ""maintain European political and economic independence"" but predicted that the plan would require Europe to ""take the heat"" from what Washington would see as a major threat to the US dollar-backed financial system. On Thursday, the EU said it had added seven more member states to the 10 originally signed up to INSTEX, and hinted that non-EU member states would also join the controversial barter scheme.

""A large-cap company will consciously decide whether they can work with Iran in a proper way, or whether it's not worth the effort.

For the individual, it may be ""just one photo"" or ""just a few minutes of video|"" but, taken together, our collective internet traffic contributes enormously to climate change. Everything a computer, tablet or smartphone does requires electricity. And, to generate that electricity, the world still predominantly uses fossil fuels — which produce carbon dioxide and contribute to heat-trapping greenhouse gases. Read more: How hard is a low-carbon lifestyle? A Berlin family tells all Digital technologies have even surpassed the aerospace industry in terms of carbon emissions. While aviation's share of global CO2 emissions is estimated to be around 2.5%, and rising, nearly 4% of all CO2 emissions can now be attributed to global data transfer and the necessary infrastructure, according to a recent study by Paris-based think tank The Shift Project. The NGO is researching ways to redesign the world's economy so that it runs on renewable energy. 'Limited energy resources' The calculations include both the energy costs of creating IT infrastructure and the actual use of that infrastructure — with the latter consuming 10 percentage points more electricity than the production of all equipment and technology combined. According to a projection by IT giant Cisco, by 2022 around 60% of the world's population will be online, with video making up more than 80 percent of all internet traffic. Maxime Efoui-Hess, an energy and environmental expert at The Shift Project and author of the study, said we need to urgently reconsider the future of internet use and think about cutting back. Read more: Swedes switch to trains due to global warming ""We have limited energy resources|"" he said, pointing out that even if we make the shift to renewables now, ""the internet is a worldwide thing, so it would require every country in the world to be powered by renewable energy."" But he said that goal remains impossible in such a short time, meaning we can't let internet usage grow as rapidly as it has to this point. The largest share of that growth is now video traffic: 80% of all data transferred online is video data, with nearly 60% of that being online video, meaning streaming videos stored on a server and viewed remotely, via sites like Netflix, YouTube or Vimeo. ""Why study, if our future is being destroyed?"" This sign features a sentiment shared by increasing numbers of German students, who have joined young people worldwide in using Friday school strikes to call for action on climate change. The movement was inspired by 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who began her protests alone in front of the Swedish parliament in August 2018. With the 2015 Paris climate accord, nearly all of the world's countries committed to limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, preferably 1.5 degrees (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), by 2100. The hope is that this target will prevent the worst effects of climate disasters. Concerned by the dire predictions from climate scientists, more and more people have called for immediate action. Despite urgent warnings, politicians have dragged their heels on important climate decisions. It's become clear that Germany will miss its targets for 2020. Climate protection was an important factor in the European elections in late May, with the Greens winning more than 20% of the vote in Germany alone, more than double previous results. Among 18-24-year-olds, 34% backed the party. Germany's climate movement is fighting on many fronts. In recent years, activists have fought to preserve Hambach Forest in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, building treehouses to prevent the old-growth forest from being felled to make way for the mining of lignite, or brown coal. Energy giant RWE has launched legal action, and police have cleared the camp several times. In September 2018, a few days after the camp was removed again, a court ruling suspended the clearing of the forest until late 2020, after a lawsuit by environmental group BUND. RWE has argued that the forest has to be cut in order to ensure the coal necessary for Germany's electricity supply. Around 50,000 activists celebrated the victory. Protests organized by groups such as Ende Gelände have increasingly been making headlines. Thousands of young activists have come out to staged events, blocking railway tracks used to deliver coal to power plants near Cologne and occupying huge coal excavators, as seen here in the open-pit mine in the east German town of Welzow in 2016. In January 2019, after seven months of negotiations, a coal commission set up by the federal government to work out Germany's plans to phase out coal power released its findings. It recommended that Germany should continue coal mining until 2038, at the latest —far too late for the country to meet the targets of the 2015 Paris climate accord. An increasing number of young people in Germany are demanding that the government find a way to meet the 1.5-degree target. The emerging Fridays for Future movement has been getting support from longtime environmentalists, teachers, academics and parents. They have called for all German coal-fired power plants to be shut down by 2030, and for renewable energy initiatives to be vastly expanded. Author: Gero Rueter The problem: transferring videos online is data-intensive. In 2018, online video traffic was responsible for more than 300 million tons of CO2, equivalent to what a country the size of Spain releases in a year — for all sectors combined. The higher a video's resolution, the more data that's required. Ten hours of high-definition film consumes more bits and bytes than all the English-language articles in Wikipedia put together, according to The Shift Project. The way we consume videos and movies has also changed radically. In the past, films told a story with moving pictures and music; today, online videos are primarily used to hook a person's attention for as long as possible. ""It moves, and there's sound, and that's attractive to our brain|"" said Efoui-Hess. ""But it can lead to addictive behavior."" Platforms like YouTube, Facebook and Netflix have increasingly exploited this biological preference, he said. The autoplay function lets videos start automatically, without sound and with subtitles, making information even easier to consume. ""That's just the way to make you watch the whole video — and it works."" Read more: Climate emergency: New hope, or just empty words? Last mile is crucial Can this growing hunger for videos be satisfied, in a way that spares the climate? Or do we have to go without our favorite streaming TV series and films? Efoui-Hess points out that it would indeed be better to watch something on a standard TV broadcast — analogue broadcasting also consumes electricity, but the data is only transmitted over a limited geographical area, rather than halfway around the world, as is the case with streaming video. Lutz Stobbe, who researches the environmental impact of information and telecommunications technology at the Fraunhofer Institute for Reliability and Microintegration in Berlin, said when it comes to data transfer, the last mile is crucial — as in, what specific technology is used to bring the data to the consumer. Mobile data transfer uses the most electricity. Basic transmission loss, solid structures like buildings, vegetation and atmospheric conditions — in other words, weather — can weaken electromagnetic waves and led to buffering videos. For that reason, the transmission signal needs to be boosted, especially when the signal is being routed over long distances through old copper cables. ""The power amplifiers have a low electrical efficiency, which means that about half of the energy used for data transmission is lost as heat|"" said Stobbe. ""The most efficient transmission technology is fiber-optic cables, which transmit signals by light."" Germans, for example, mainly surf the internet via copper cables; as of 2017, just over 2% of all broadband connections in the country used fiber-optic cables. By contrast, the mobile communication network is being expanded on a massive scale. To help save on energy, Stobbe is currently working on something known as edge computing, in which the desired data is stored locally, closer to the consumer in places like data centers in major cities. That way, it doesn't have to travel as far to get to where it's going. Exhausted tech Stobbe said those hoping for next-generation devices and processes to be more energy-efficient will be disappointed. When it comes to technology, energy efficiency hasn't improved significantly in the last decade. That's why it's best to use your older devices as long as possible, he said. What remains are small tweaks to our daily routine. ""This is what's called digital hygiene|"" said Stobbe. ""Do you really need to upload 25 images of the same thing to the cloud? Every photo, every video is constantly backed up, for safety reasons, and that consumes energy every time. If instead you delete a few things here and there, you can save energy."" Read more: AI art: A game-changer in fighting climate change? Efoui-Hess is also an advocate of small changes. ""Use Wi-Fi, not mobile networks, watch on the smallest screen you can — and high-definition video on a smartphone aren't really necessary|"" he said, pointing out that watching high-definition videos on a smartphone over a mobile network uses the most electricity, and consequently is the worst for the climate. To raise awareness of the impact everyday digital life has on the climate, The Shift Project has developed a CO2 calculator browser add-on that measures the emissions generated by internet activity. Nevertheless, the NGO doesn't place the responsibility solely on the end user; it believes the issue should be an important part of the political agenda. But so far, neither governments nor international institutions have recognized the problem, let alone made any efforts to bring about change.

"a-49541308"|"https://www.dw.com/en/norways-sovereign-wealth-fund-backs-away-from-fossil-fuels/a-49541308"|"Holger Trzeczak (an)"|"The electric car pensioner Rune Faerbjorg parks by a supermarket in Oslo, Norway, is the fourth on the street — a typical scene for a country in which almost half of new cars registered are zero emission. Since buying an electric car, Faerbjorg says, he doesn't need to pay for gasoline. ""Electricity is cheap here in Norway."" Parking is not. The ticket machine in the car park shows half an hour costs €3, an hour €6 and two hours €14 — a deterrent against driving for the weekly shop. Since the early 1990s, the Norwegian capital has used high parking fees to arm its city center against traffic. Oslo showcases what in many European capitals has proved elusive: low-emission traffic. For several car companies, notably Tesla, Oslo has become a test laboratory for a future without fossil fuels. Pragmatism defines Norway — a country that can afford it. It has cheap public transport, low electricity prices and a generous social welfare system. Norwegians, on average, earn €70,000 a year. Germans earn just €36,000. Norway is one of the richest countries in the world. With revenues from oil, gas and electricity from hydropower, the state tries to make the most out of its resources. Electric cars are on the rise in Norway Norway's influential pension fund Look on the website of Norway's State Pension Fund, managed by the Norwegian Central Bank, and this becomes clear. Whether led by conservatives, as it is today, or social democrats, as it was when first founded, the fund is uncontroversial. Right on the first page, the fund presents a monstrous number: 9 314 807 748 613 Norwegian Kroner, or almost one trillion euros. A de facto debt-free and climate-conscious Norway has just one problem: How to spend it? The fluctuating oil price From a spacious office overlooking Oslo's rooftops, Egil Matsen, vice president of Norway's central bank, looks like he is used to solving luxury problems. But after Norway's parliament decided in March to remove another 134 coal and oil companies from the fund's investment list, what should he do with the money? Rather than talk about climate protection, ethical investments, or the central bank's response to previous restrictions, Matsen plays his cards close to his chest. Send Facebook Twitter google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/3LIHJ The price of oil is fluctuating, he says, and so is our yield. Even though the last quarter brought record revenues? That only shows that you can make good money somewhere else, he says. Until recently, Matsen had a well-paid but basically unspectacular job. Now, he realizes that his words are being weighted by the world media as if he were Europe's central bank chief Mario Draghi. Markets move if he says too much. The companies in which he may no longer invest were his cash cows. Exxon, Shell, RWE and Glencore are the best-known ones. He knows some of their bosses personally. We're not definitely pulling out, Matsen says, but we're setting deadlines and urging these companies to invest more in renewable energies. Buying time — somehow — is important to him. Through the state-owned energy firm Equinor, Norway, Western Europe's biggest oil producer, feeds large sums of money into the fund. 170,000 Norwegian jobs depend on it. That is a weighty issue in Norway, a country of 5 million people. For this reason, Matsen does not want to be seen as an actor in the global climate debate. He knows everything is moving too slowly for environmental groups. But his first criterion is not global carbon dioxide emissions. Matsen serves the gigantic number on the fund website. Oslo is reducing cars in the city center by removing parking and promoting alternative transport Hope for the climate? In 1990, the fund started with the equivalent of almost €200 million. By 2008, when the global financial system crashed, the fund had grown to around €200 billion — a thousand-fold increase. While most countries were drowning in debt, Norway had the money to become a political force. They began to withdraw investments from nuclear weapons stocks. Money was taken from environmental polluters, tobacco companies and those accused of child labor. Since the global financial crisis, the fund's value has more than quadrupled. From around 2014, a redistribution of money under the term ""divestment"" gained political relevance. And because the Norwegians have long since demonstrated that the big money from pension funds can have an impact, they have become the hope of activists across the globe. No new Scandinavian climate hero NGOs such as Carbon Tracker in London calculated that Exxon & Co.'s coal and oil reserves must never be allowed to come out of the ground if the 1.5 degree climate target is to be achieved. They launched the campaign term ""stranded assets"" which in a carbon-neutral future may be worthless. And they recognize Norway as a pioneer of divestment. Marianne Eikvag Groth, state secretary at the Norwegian Ministry of Finance, tries to dispel this impression. The parliament's decision on Norway's withdrawal from coal, oil and gas means nothing for the time being, she said. ""We are not aiming to send a message to the world… This fund is not an instrument of environmental policy or foreign policy, it's an instrument to take care of the Norwegian people's savings."" But isn't that a signal to the world? Doesn't that give hope that the targets agreed in the Paris Climate Accord could be implemented? Groth's press spokeswoman, at this point, interjects to say Groth must attend a meeting. ""The Norwegian government is speaking with two tongues here — the ministry of finance can't state often enough this is nothing to do with climate|"" says climate activist Anja Bakken Riise. But in front of climate-striking school kids, said Riise, the Norwegian prime minister Erna Solberg stressed what the government had done to divest from oil companies. But Riise acknowledges that the fund turning its back on fossil fuel companies — whether for financial or climate reasons — still has global appeal."|"Coal and oil have long been sought-after investment targets, but that is changing.

"a-49544177"|"https://www.dw.com/en/final-vw-beetle-drives-off-mexico-factory-floor/a-49544177"|""|"Wednesday's send-off for a car in metallic-blue was the last of 1.7 million ""New Beetles"" produced by Volkswagen in Mexico, and ended more than seven ""very important"" decades of manufacture, said the German car giant. Volkswagen's Puebla works, southeast of Mexico City, would, however, continue producing different VW models, including the Golf and Jetta, while focusing on electric and larger family vehicles for the United States. At Wednesday's ceremony, complete with mariachi band and confetti, VW Mexico CEO Steffen Reiche said the era had ended for a car that had ""conquered the hearts of the people with its special design and quality."" ""Today is the last day. It has been very emotional|"" he said. Volkswagen announced the last of its iconic Beetle compact cars would roll off assembly lines in 2019. While there will be two special models manufactured before production ceases, it's the original ""Bug"" that still generates the most emotion among its fans. DW looks at how views of the ""people's car"" have changed over the decades. In the 1930s, Nazi ruler Adolf Hitler tapped Ferdinand Porsche (L) to design a ""Volkswagen|"" or ""people's car"" — an affordable, mass-market vehicle that could carry a family and luggage. He came up with a two-door, rear-engine vehicle that could cruise at top speeds of 100 km/h (62 m/hr). Initial production of the car remained small. Sales of the car, officially named the Type 1, picked up after the British, one of Germany's post-WWII occupying powers, relaunched Volkswagen factory production. In 1955, the millionth car rolled off the assembly line. It was only then that the rounded car earned its nickname ""the Beetle."" The moniker was then carried over into numerous languages as sales of the car spread around the globe. It took a while for the Beetle to become popular in the US, however, in part due to the car's Nazi roots. But a 1960s marketing rebrand and the car's starring role in the 1968 movie ""The Love Bug"" as Herbie (above), a Beetle with a mind of its own, sealed its place in the hearts of Americans — and in their garages. Beetle sales in the US plummeted in the 1970s and production there ceased in 1979. By that time, the car was being produced around the world, including in Mexico and Latin America. In the 1990s, VW decided to give the car another go in the US. They revamped the design and released the New Beetle (above) in 1998, complete with a built-in flower vase. As the New Beetle took off in the US, global production of the original Type 1 Beetle came to an end. By July 30, 2003, when the last of its kind came off the production belt in Puebla, Mexico, over 21,500,000 had been produced. The final car (above) received a ceremonial sendoff complete with mariachi band. Dubbed ""El Rey"" (""the king""), the car was sent to VW headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany. Despite no longer being made, the original Beetle remained popular and recognizable, often linked to 1960s nostalgia. However, it also made a political statement. While holding the post of Uruguay's president from 2010-2015, Jose Mujica continued to use his 1987 Beetle to get around (above). The old car, part of his personal abstention from luxury, cemented his reputation as a humble politician. The VW entered its third generation in 2012, with the production of a new model in the US. But just six years later VW said it would cease making the car in 2019, instead focusing on electric and family vehicles. VW's CEO left the door open to revive the much beloved Beetle in the future. Until then, however, the iconic car will continue to hold a place in the hearts of old and young alike. Author: Cristina Burack Devised under Hitler The first ""Beetle|"" or Käfer in German, was conceived in the 1930s by a design team led by engineer Ferdinand Porsche, tasked by German dictator Adolf Hitler. During the war, VW used slave labor at what became its headquarters Wolfsburg in northern Germany and documented on site since 1999 in former air raid bunker. Read more: Hitler and 'his Volkswagen' After World War II, in Allied-occupied Germany, the car was rebranded and went into mass production. Exports of the reputedly robust vehicle, with a rear air-cooled motor, began to the United States in 1949. Inspired film character Its headlights resembling eyes inspired even a film series, starring ""Herbie|"" a fictionalized 1963 Beetle with human characteristics. In Mexico City, two-door versions, popularly known as ""vochos|"" became ever-present as taxis. Original terminated in 2003 The original Beetle series was sold in Germany up until 1985, latterly as Beetles imported from Mexico. Assembly in Mexico was terminated in 2003, ending a total run of 21.5 million cars produced. In 1997, Pueblo had already begun production of the successor ""New Beetle|"" emulating the original's round shape. A second-generation ""New Beetle"" followed in 2011. Climbed hills ""without problem' Mexico City locals on Wednesday said the front-engine ""New Beetle"" failed to impress. ""The new ones don't get uphill, and the old ones can climb any incline without a problem|"" said taxi driver Adrian Martinez. Businessman David Alvarez said his 2008 New Beetle with a roll-down top still ""turns a lot of heads in the streets."" Mechanic Juan Jose Fragoso said spare parts to fix older Beetles had become ""very scarce|"" leaving him dependent on a business partner who bought and disassembled broken or abandoned so-called Type 1 Beetles.

DW contacted the Israeli energy ministry for comment but has received no reply. An Israeli soldier patrols near the Gaza Strip border with Israel. Gaza relies on Israel to meet almost all its energy needs The finds The discovery of a large gas field, Tamar, off the coast of Israel in 2009 opened up a new era for the Eastern Mediterranean as an energy hot spot. At the time, the gas field was the most prominent field ever found in the subexplored area of the Levantine Basin, which covers about 83,000 square kilometers. Read more: Gas, pipeline dreams and gunboat diplomacy in Mediterranean Several alternatives are being considered by Egypt, Cyprus and Israel to transport the energy to markets in Europe and one of two options will likely happen: the expensive and technologically complex EastMed pipeline or developing Egypt's LNG facilities. Israel and the US are pushing for the EastMed pipeline. The EU is seeking new sources to diversify away from Russia, as internal production falls and demand is set to spike, and the region is close, gas-rich and relatively cheap — or could be. The Eastern Mediterranean is estimated to have about 2,100 billion cubic meters (bcm) of so far untapped gas. The EU's consumption was 458.5 bcm in 2018 and 465.7 bcm in 2017, according to BP Stats Review 2019. EastMed would be a 2,200-kilometer pipeline that would pass under the sea base of the islands of Cyprus and Crete and connect to Europe in Greece. ""But EastMed is a technically difficult project, and politically it is made more complicated by the role of Turkey and the Cypriot waters through which it would have to go|"" Tim Boersma, director of Global Natural Gas Markets at Columbia University's SIPA Center on Global Energy Policy, told DW. President of Cyprus Nicos Anastasiades (r), Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras (c) and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (l) meeting in May 2018 Palestine at the back of the line There are several large projects in the US' recently unveiled $50 billion plan for Israeli-Palestinian peace, including $1 billion in grants, loans and private sector financing for the development of a natural gas field offshore of Gaza. The gas field, Gaza Marine, is owned by the Palestine Investment Fund (PIF). PIF Chief Executive Officer Mohammad Mustafa told The National in April that it normally takes two to three years to develop it [an offshore gas field]. ""Assuming no political difficulties, we hope to be able to start next year|"" he said. Gaza Marine is estimated to hold up to a trillion cubic feet of gas, equivalent to Spain's consumption in 2016, according to the US Energy Information Administration. The project is expected to generate revenues of around $2.4 billion (€2 billion) in royalties and taxes over its life, estimated to be 15 years. At present, the West Bank and Gaza rely on Israel to meet almost all their energy needs, and the Palestinians pay about $2 billion a year to Israel to cover their energy needs. So the development of the field would be ""transformational|"" according to Robin Mills, chief executive of Qamar Energy. Crossed lines British Gas (BG Group) and its partners had originally been granted oil and gas exploration rights in a 25-year agreement signed in November 1999 with the PA. A precondition of the deal was that surplus gas would be supplied to Israel. Tel Aviv refused to enter into a deal and the problems started, although with relatively small finds at that stage, the issue was just one of many in the ensuing Israel-Gaza conflict. In 2018, Shell relinquished its 55% stake in the field that it took over as part of its acquisition of BG Group in 2016. PIF then became the field's sole owner. It is searching for an operator and buyer for a 45% stake. ""The PA doesn't decide unilaterally on projects like this, and if Israel gets even the slightest whiff of Hamas gaining financially from this kind of precept, it will pull the plug|"" says Boersma. ""As Kushner's plan rightly suggests, there is a huge potential upside to Israel-PA collaboration. But it is conditioned on there being peace, and there is no peace."" Plans for the development of Gaza Marine predate Israel's discovery of its own gas reserves, Baconi says. ""Israel's opposition to the development of the field, now couched in security arguments, predate Hamas's takeover of the Gaza Strip|"" Baconi says. ""Israel has an economic incentive to ensure Palestinians remain reliant on Israeli energy, as a captive market, then develop their own resources|"" Baconi says. Putin in the wings? In January Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas met with Russian President Vladimir Putin to officially sign an investment agreement aiming to develop the Gaza offshore gas field.

The Librem 5 alternative With Android and iOS making up 98.7% of all smartphones in the world, it would be a daunting task for any new company to enter the market and take on the big players. But California-based tech company Purism, backed by a crowdfunding campaign that has totaled $2.5million (€2.2 million) to date, is attempting just that. The Librem 5, due for release in the third quarter of 2019, is a smartphone built on the Linux operating system, which doesn't store user data and promises to deliver an ethical smartphone that does not track or exploit your digital life. While it will offer relatively primitive functionality for calls, text messaging and web browsing, it promises to be a step toward a more ethical mobile future. It seems unlikely that the Librem 5 will occupy anything more than a niche position in the global market, but such projects have been praised for enhancing and broadening the available choices on the market for consumers. ""It is morally and ethically wrong for any company or government to know your every location, everything you do, and everybody you talk to|"" Purism's founder and CEO, Todd Weaver, told DW. ""To have a freedom-respecting digital society we need to make sure that people can protect their location, their data and their communication."" Weaver believes awareness around these issues is growing, and the more people know about the abuses of their data, the less willing they are to accept it and that the foundations are being laid for a digital rights movement.

Deutsche's rapidly disappearing share price has been in line with its shrinking revenues. The bank is also being investigated for alleged money laundering abuses. The past 18 months has surely been the worst period of its 149-year history. The last week has been particularly brutal for many of the bank's rank-and-file workers — 18,000 job losses were announced amid a major restructuring. As the waters have risen around Deutsche over the last year, many underperforming executives have understandably departed. Less understandable is the amount of money they have received on leaving. John Cryan, who presided over some of the bank's biggest failings as CEO from 2015-2018, received $12.2 million when he was forced out in April 2018. That was just the beginning of the payoff splurge. According to research by the Financial Times, six more senior executives who departed between May 2018 and July 2019 — Marcus Schenck, Kim Hammonds, Nicolas Moreau, Garth Ritchie, Frank Strauss and Sylvie Matherat — received $46 million between them. Send Facebook Twitter google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/3Lm6s EU and shareholders struggle to rein it in Deutsche Bank's singular level of failure, combined with the eye-watering sums it has doled out to those who facilitated that failure, makes it a somewhat extreme example. But the issue of extravagant payoffs to departing executives is a problem across the financial sector and in other areas, according to Benoit Lallemand, secretary general of Finance Watch, a Brussels-based NGO that lobbies for greater financial regulation. Following the 2007-08 financial crisis, the European Commission moved to curb excessive banker pay and bonuses through the 2013 Capital Requirements Directive. Lallemand says severance packages or ""golden parachutes"" such as those enjoyed by departing Deutsche Bank executives are ""a sort of loophole"" to that legislation because executives whose pay or bonuses are capped will come in the end anyway. He believes the European Banking Authority (EBA), an EU regulatory agency, should update its guidelines and push for stronger legislation. ""This is not just typical NGO language wanting to punish bankers|"" he says. ""This would ensure good practice and good governance in terms of the incentives you give top management."" The EU directive leaves much of the power in the hands of shareholders. Sean Byrne from the School of Business at the Technological University of Dublin says that ultimately, shareholders are not always the best people to rein in excessive payouts. Deutsche Bank cut 18,000 jobs this week, but seven senior executives at the company received more than €50 million in severance pay over the past year ""There is a big issue about how management's operations are controlled by shareholders|"" he said. ""It hasn't proven possible really. Nobody has really come up with a long-term solution to the problem of getting management to act in the best interests of shareholders."" A spokesperson for the Confederation of German Employers' Associations (BDA) told DW that in Germany, salary structures and remuneration issues in larger companies are almost always decided by the supervisory board. ""We assume that the supervisory board regularly meets its responsibilities appropriately and makes well-balanced decisions for the company|"" the spokesperson said. BaFin on the horizon? A spokesperson for the Association of German Banks (Bundesverband deutscher Banken), a lobby group for the German financial sector, told DW that the group could not comment on individual cases, such as that of Deutsche Bank. The group said banks were bound by EU regulations and by those of BaFin — Germany's financial regulator — which has requirements on severance payments, as part of the so-called ""Supervisory Requirements for Institutions' Remuneration Systems."" ""Severance payments must take into account the person's previous performance. In particular, negative contributions to success or misconduct are to be taken into account|"" the legislation states. However, with multiple exceptions to the legislation requirements, it appears that Deutsche Bank executives' payoffs are not subject to BaFin scrutiny. As mentioned, much of the oversight power lies in the hands of shareholders, rather than regulators. A spokesperson for BaFin told DW that the regulator could not comment on individual banks. The financial crisis of 2007-08 led to mass protests and more stringent regulation, but Benoit Lallemand says ""arrogance"" has crept back into the financial sector Baby, you're a rich man too Despite regular bouts of public outrage at what many deem excessive pay, bonuses and severance packages in the financial sector, Lallemand says the sector itself justifies the figures by saying they are necessary to attract the right kind of ""talent"" to a company. ""I suppose you are sending a signal to potential new recruits that you are well treated even when you are laid off|"" he says. Sean Byrne agrees, and says another major problem is that executive contracts tend to be watertight, as so much is made in the financial sector of the need to secure ""the best talent"" with generous contracts. ""All of these top executives have watertight contracts that specify what they will get|"" he said. ""But the interesting thing is that the evidence doesn't show a close relationship between how high executive pay is and the performance of the company."" Alongside the specific question of high severance payoffs, there is the more general question of how much CEOs and senior executives in large corporations get paid, relative to the average worker in their country. Based on Bloomberg's annual Global CEO Index (see graphic), the disparity between the average earnings of a CEO and an average worker is largest in the United States, although Germany also makes the top 10. Flawed characters Professor Niamh Brennan, Academic Director of the University College Dublin Centre for Corporate Governance, says that in her opinion ""the remuneration of executives is a bit of a racket."" ""One of the reasons why it doesn't work properly is because of the human relationship issues around the board and between the board and the executives. ""For example, if you have somebody who says things like 'company executives get paid too much and they rip off the shareholders '...what would you say your chances of getting onto a listed company board would be if you expressed these kind of views? ""There is a certain kind of self-selection bias and the kind of people that get onto boards of listed companies. They know what the game is. The game certainly isn't standing up the chief executive and telling him you're getting paid far too much."" She believes there is little chance of the industry regulating itself. ""There is an awful lot of self-serving arguments mobilized to protect the establishment situation|"" she said. ""The argument is constantly trotted out that if we don't pay the CEO staggering amounts of money then he will leave and go elsewhere. Send Facebook Twitter google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/38AUK ""That is a very dangerous dynamic because you are getting people for these jobs who have a single metric in mind and that is money. If you have people at the top of organizations for whom their own staggering sums of money is their No.1 objective, they are likely to be flawed characters."" Advocates of greater financial regulation like Lallemand at Finance Watch say legislation is the only way to deal with the issue of excessive payoffs and believes the EBA has the power to significantly beef up their powers on the issue. Regardless of when that happens, if it ever does, it will come too late to deal with the Deutsche Bank executives who left with lucrative payoffs over the last year, and indeed, for the many thousands who lost their jobs this week."|"Public outrage at departing financial executives receiving millions is often palpable.

During the trip, both sides inked a host of agreements, including two deals to provide loans to the Bangladeshi power sector, worth $1.7 billion (€1.52 billion). The countries also expressed interest in accelerating the work related to the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Economic Corridor (BCIM EC) project, an initiative aimed at expanding the economic ties of the four countries that together are home to nearly 3 billion people. Bangladesh and China turned their relationship into a strategic partnership in 2016, and, in recent years, Chinese investment in the South Asian country has risen rapidly. As part of Chinese President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Beijing and Dhaka signed deals worth $21.5 billion covering a raft of power and infrastructure projects. To date, pledged BRI-related investment in Bangladesh stands at around $38 billion, estimates Standard Chartered, a British bank.

""Traditional sources of funding are not adequate for emerging economies like Bangladesh."" Chinese money brings with it other advantages, Mansur said. ""It creates a bit of competitive environment. It prompts countries like Japan and India to also come forward and invest."" Bangladesh has announced an ambitious plan to set up 100 special economic zones by 2030. Many Chinese companies appear interested in investing in these zones. Zhejiang Jindun Pressure Vessel Co Ltd., for instance, has offered to invest $5 billion in one such site near Chittagong. The collapse of the nine-story Rana Plaza garment factory in Dhaka on April 24, 2013, is one of the world's worst industrial accidents. More than 1,100 people were killed and another 2,000 were injured in the tragedy. The disaster shed light on the poor safety conditions in Bangladeshi factories, many of which produce clothing for Western brands. Dozens of people, including Rana Plaza's owner, are standing trial for negligence. Despite some reforms to improve safety in the billion-dollar industry, Bangladeshi textile workers remain some of the lowest paid in the world. Bangladesh's deadliest industrial blaze to date tore through one of Dhaka's most densely populated areas on June 3, 2010, killing 117 people. A number of multi-story apartment buildings and shops in the Nimtoli district went up in flames after an electrical transformer exploded. At least 112 workers were killed in a fire at the nine-story Tazreen Fashion factory in the outskirts of Dhaka on November 24, 2012. An investigation later found it was caused by arson and that managers at the Ashulia district plant had locked the gates to prevent victims from getting out. Above, a soldier inspects a room of charred sewing machines. At least 70 people were killed in a fire that engulfed apartment blocks in a historic Dhaka shopping district on February 20, 2019. The blaze began in a property in Chawkbazar where chemicals for household products were being stored illegally, before quickly spreading to several other buildings. It took almost 12 hours for firefighters to put out the flames. A fire triggered by a boiler explosion at a cigarette packaging factory north of Dhaka on September 10 killed some 31 people. Chemicals stored on the ground floor of the Tongi warehouse are thought to have helped the blaze spread quickly. A boiler explosion was also behind the collapse of garment factory in Gazipur, a city north of the capital, on July 4, 2017. Thirteen people were killed. Fortunately, thousands of workers were away for the Eid holidays. A debt trap? In South Asia, Bangladesh is the second-biggest receiver of Chinese investment, behind Pakistan. But not everyone seems optimistic about the development, with many warning that the growing reliance on Chinese money will make Dhaka beholden to Beijing. Critics point to Sri Lanka's experience, where Colombo had to cede control of its southern port of Hambantota to China on a 99-year lease after it failed to repay its debts. Mansur, however, said it would be more beneficial for Bangladesh to draw direct investment from China rather than debt financing. ""Chinese investment comes in both equity and debt. The infrastructure projects are mostly carried out through debt financing|"" Mansur said. ""So I would rather be interested in equity, not debt."" Read more: China: A loan shark or the good Samaritan? It's too early to say that Bangladesh is falling into a debt trap, some experts argue. Bangladesh's total external debt at the end of 2018 stood at around $33.1 billion, and the share owed to China doesn't seem big, they say. ""The loans granted to Bangladesh by China so far account for just 6% of the total debt|"" Zahid Hussain, lead economist of the World Bank's Dhaka office, told DW. ""There is not enough information as to the grounds on which the loans have been granted|"" Hussain said. However, the analyst didn't want to call the Chinese investment a ""debt trap."" ""It presents both risks and opportunities. The information we have so far doesn't point us to a debt trap scenario."" Skeptics, however, remain worried about China's growing economic influence over Bangladesh. Why is India concerned? But trade and investment may not always have the last word when it comes to international relations. In 2016, Dhaka quietly killed a deep sea port project that China proposed to build at Sonadia, in southeastern Bangladesh. New Delhi expressed concern about the project, which if completed would have brought the Chinese presence closer to India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Nevertheless, China's increasing economic clout in South Asia presents a huge challenge for New Delhi, not for economic reasons, but for political and security reasons, said Siegfried O. Wolf, director of research at the South Asia Democratic Forum (SADF), a Brussels-based think tank.

""So there is a threat for India that China might influence the government of Bangladesh."" This influence may also have an economic dimension, Wolf said.

"a-49532400"|"https://www.dw.com/en/health-insurance-for-worlds-poorest-people/a-49532400"|"Nils Zimmermann"|"Bihar is one of India's poorest states. Situated in the country's northeast, Bihar is neatly bisected by the Ganges river which flows west to east through the state. Its biggest city, Patna, is on the river's south bank. If you set out from Patna and cross the river by way of the five-kilometer-long (3.1-mile-long) Mahatma Gandhi Setu bridge, drive north along Highway 22 for about an hour, and then take a right onto Mahua Road, in another half hour or so you will arrive in the village of Gorigama, in the district of Vaishali. It's a place David Dror knows well. ""I spent 10 years in India, starting in 2005|"" he told DW. ""My team was in Vaishali several days each month for five years. We started the field work for the community-based mutual health insurance fund in Gorigama in 2009, working with an NGO called Nidan. We launched the fund in 2011."" At meetings with rural people in Gorigama and many villages like it, Dror and his colleagues patiently engaged in what he calls ""insurance education|"" answering questions from villagers about how local mutual health microinsurance works, discussing its benefits and costs. Protection against financial disaster In one Bihar village some years ago, a woman named Bimla Devi told her story to a writer accompanying Dror on a field outing. Devi's son and daughter were both very ill, and she knew they needed health care. ""Earlier, if anyone of us got sick, my heart would shake with fear|"" she said. ""What if the doctor wanted some test or medicine that I just could not afford? What would I do then? Do you know how much these things cost? I would have been finished!"" If villagers are uninsured, in an emergency they often either get no medical care, or they borrow money from local money lenders who charge high interest rates. This can generate a downward spiral of permanent indebtedness and hardship, sometimes even forcing them to sell their animals or their land — a disaster for a rural family. ""Attempts to provide health care have been least effective in rural and informal settings where most of the world's poorest people live and work|"" Dror said. By setting up local savings pools — microinsurance funds — members can avoid becoming destitute if they need medical treatment that they could not otherwise afford without borrowing money. David Dror talking to locals in the village of Gorigama, India The amounts involved are surprisingly small: ""Three to five euros a year per person is a typical pay-in|"" Dror said. ""Yet if a few thousand people join, this small amount can save member families from destitution if there's a medical emergency."" Community-based health insurance (CBHI): How it works It takes a long time — at least six weeks, and sometimes nearly a year, Dror said — to organize a CBHI. A group of villagers, prompted and advised by a CBHI facilitator, decide whether to set up a local microinsurance scheme, what medical services to cover, and what the cost of joining should be. It's a grassroots, democratic process. Typically, CBHI schemes cover elements of outpatient care that can have big variations in price, like medical tests and imaging. Health micro-insurance aims to reduce the risk of destitution or dependence on loan sharks. Not covered by CBHI, in general, are hospital stays (because people believe the government covers these, even if in reality they are often not available), medicines (because they're too expensive), and routine consultations whose price is known and stable. Local care delivery Villagers typically do not like to travel long distances to health care centers in town, Dror said, because travel is expensive, stressful, time-consuming and disruptive. The downside is that care-givers in rural areas are often not professionally qualified; they are ""unqualified"" practitioners. Some are better than others, but on the whole, Dror said, ""they're better than nothing|"" and they have the advantage that they deliver ""all included"" doorstep services: Their fee includes services such as diagnosis, setting a broken limb, some medicine or an injection; and if they are uncertain, sometimes they refer a case to a better qualified doctor. ""Even in industrialized countries, there's a shortage of doctors in rural areas|"" Dror pointed out. ""In India or Africa, it's worse. Doctors like living in towns, where their kids can get a good education. So in rural areas, the choice is often between an untrained practitioner or nothing at all."" Dror acknowledged that it would be very good if these informal allopathic practitioners would be given ongoing training in practical nursing by government programs, to improve the quality of the care they deliver. However, doctors' associations tended to oppose this, ostensibly to avoid legitimizing quacks, but in reality, Dror suggested, the real motivation may be to prevent competition. Dror's big challenge now is to scale up the microinsurance approach to encompass millions of people, rather than a few tens of thousands as at present. He says that between 1 and 3 billion people in rural India, Africa, and elsewhere could potentially benefit if it were rolled out on a big scale. After 10 years of field work, he knows what works and what is missing.His next target is to establish a program in Africa.

I offered the WHO help with its activities in support of community-based health insurance|"" Dror said. ""I have discussed with them preparatory steps, notably the need to educate a cadre of persons that could then work in the field. I proposed that Mekele University should launch an MSc in financing and administration of microinsurance."" In early June of this year, Dror was informed that professor Kindeya, president of Mekele University, and Dr. Hagos, head of the Health Bureau, have agreed to develop an MSc program on health financing to help effective implementation of CBHI in Tigray region, which is home to nearly 7 million of Ethiopia's estimated 112 million people. In Ethiopia, Dror explained, the CBHI strategy draws on a traditional Ethiopian practice known as Idir, a long-standing system of pooling savings amongst neighbors to have funds available to pay for funerals when member families have deaths. CBHI proponents proposed redirecting some Idir money to life-saving expenses, including costs of basic health care services delivered at local health care centers. A decade in the field During the first three years of his field work on CBHI, Dror said, he commuted between Delhi and Europe — he had University duties as a professor in Rotterdam. Then he shifted to living full-time in Delhi for seven years, where he founded the Micro-Insurance Academy. Dror is a tall, fit man with a powerful physique; to look at him, you'd say he is about 65 years old. But in fact he is 76. For the past few years, he has lived in Geneva in semiretirement. Yet he keeps working on promoting the adoption of community-based health insurance, because he has seen with his own eyes that it can make a night-and-day difference to thousands of rural families. His goal is to firmly establish this model of health insurance by seeing at least 1 million people enrolled in CBHI. ""I have to get this done during my lifetime|"" he told DW in a tone of firm determination, so given his age, his quest is urgent now."|"David Dror is a driven man.

"a-49556092"|"https://www.dw.com/en/corruption-perceived-to-be-on-the-increase-in-africa/a-49556092"|"Martina Schwikowski"|"To hear more about the findings of 2019's 10th edition of the Global Corruption Barometer — Africa, DW spoke to Paul Banoba, East Africa regional adviser for Transparency International. DW: Mr. Banoba, the latest edition of the Global Corruption Barometer — Africa reveals that most people in Africa feel corruption has increased in their country. At the same, the majority feel that they, as citizens, can make a difference in the fight against corruption. What do you think citizens can contribute? Paul Banoba: The trigger for actors to take action is usually a report. The first step would be that we have an increased number of reports about where corruption is happening. But people need to be safe and encouraged in reporting corruption. Some of the ways in which this can be clear to them are through legal means, the availability of whistleblower protection legislation and mechanisms, and the clarity of the information of this availability. So they know that this exists and they can trust it. Then the number of reports is increasing and the state can take action. We also need to remind citizens that we do have a responsibility as individuals to be of integrity. If everybody acted with integrity, then ideally we are shooting corruption out. It is the responsibility of citizens not to offer a bribe because often bribes are not solicited but instead offered. That would also be a contribution in the fight against corruption. Where does people's optimism to be able to curb corruption come from? It is quite surprising, looking at the data in this regard. Our last report in 2015 indicated that, for example, 79% of Liberians who had to access services had to pay a bribe. That is high, almost eight out of 10 people. The current study indicates a reduction in Liberia to 53%. There would be some interesting discussions as to what actually happened. But we see that it is quite possible to have a reduction in corruption. We do have a rise in few other countries. Only 1% of citizens of Mauritius had to access services through paying bribes. That has gone up this year. The same applies to Botswana. But we do have examples where there is a change for the better, and maybe that is an indication and sign for optimism. Which countries suffer the most from corruption deals and why? Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) featured highest in your survey. This survey indicates that for the DRC eight out of 10 citizens who accessed services had to pay bribes. That is rather high. In Liberia, as we said, it was almost half and that goes also for Sierra Leone at 52%, so half of the citizens have to pay bribes. There are places where the situation with corruption still requires hard work from all of us. Sometimes what explains improvements is the array of anti-corruption measures in place. Where there is good rule of law and good practices with regard to it and well-resourced institutions with clear mandates, it improves the functioning of the state. And, when that happens and leadership is committed, it trickles into social will. Where society trusts, it increases the relationship between the state and its citizens, and then we have a situation that is continuously going up. One of your findings is that the police are most corrupt. How do you explain that? The police were highlighted by citizens as the institution to which they had to pay the most bribes to access services. Police are the law enforcement institution, and there is a high interaction between people and the police to report incidences of crime. They are powerful and where that power does not have accountability and no clear commitment from the top leadership, we would have challenges. Money laundering and foreign bribery also play a large role in corruption. What must be done to curb these practices? There is a lot of infrastructure development going on in Africa right now, and a number of service providers are international actors. We are recommending that laws should be put into place, a number of frameworks for anti-money laundering laws. We are asking that they should be enforced in Africa but also in the home countries of these companies so these companies behave responsibly when they are doing business in Africa. We are also calling for good standards and guidelines for ethical procurement, because a lot of the bribery would speak to the procurement process. In the end, does it not all depend on the goodwill of politicians to be accountable and create this kind of transparency and laws? Yes, largely it depends on the goodwill at the highest levels of our political leaders, so we do call for that. In fact, where political will is clear, we have seen the greatest improvement in the fight against corruption. It always starts at the top level of leadership. Policies have to be made clear and followed consistently, regardless of who is involved. The laws must be applied uniformly without impunity exercised. That builds confidence in society. In reality it seems rather problematic to uphold the laws in place. Members of opposition in parliament have a role to play. Also coalitions of civil society and oversight institutions have to point out the problems. It is a far from easy task. In fact, it is a daunting task. We have to remind our leaders on a daily basis if people are failing to access basic services that they, as leaders, have committed to provide. It means resigning to living in a dire situation and keeping people in poverty. These are the consequences of this type of measure and this is what the report that we are putting out today reflects.

As in John Brunner's ""The Shockwave Rider|"" with its idea of a government and network that's collapsed, and a separate society… It's a very technologist, libertarian view of the world. Absolutely. And Roy Walford was a symbol of that philosophy. He was an extropian fellow-traveler, a doctor, an advocate of changing your diet, taking supplements, and living longer to see these total transformations. Biosphere 2 in Arizona, USA — a testing ground for an autonomous space habitat Walford was also the chief medic on Biosphere 2, a model of technology, engineering and managing ecosystems to try to produce a completely autonomous, parallel world. It was a testing ground for an autonomous space habitat. And if you think about the theme in the book of people wanting to build off-shore political bodies or run a whole society off a platform in international waters, there's a recurring thread of an idea that if you build the right technology, you can unseat the world you were born into and create your own vision of the future.  A cryptocurrency for billions: You know an idea has gone mainstream when Facebook buys into it  It seems a very American ideology that underpins this technology. And yet it has a very real impact for us all. If this idea came from a group of people who wanted a parallel society, how must they feel that governments these days are so keen on their idea of cryptocurrency and blockchain, too? It's a bit ironic, isn't it? Oh, God, yes! And it's significant that Facebook has just formally announced its own cryptocurrency, Libra - working at the scale of billions of people in partnership with enormous corporations [Ed.: like Visa, Mastercard, Paypal, Uber].

How they've become institutionalized. Having laid the foundations for these parallel societies, they've instead been absorbed in large part by the very systems that they were meant to replace. To quote Michael Franti: ""Shining examples of the systems they set out to destroy""… Yes. But with some excepts, such as David Chaum. He developed a model of digital cash that is anonymous, protects privacy, resists the use of money for censorship, but also has a means to anonymize existing money. It's not about creating your own bank or currency or inventing something that is wholly anonymous and useful for money laundering or running drug deals. But instead it's something that works with existing governmental systems and provides a privacy-protecting alternative. And Chaum has going concerns, doesn't he, such as his ""blind signature"" technology for document protection? So that's a real impact for all of us beyond cash. It seems to be an ongoing theme from your last book - perhaps it's even the struggle of our times - this issue of how to protect privacy while moving freely between digital and analog worlds. The question of how to balance an open society that doesn't leave us all vulnerable with a level of protection that isn't abused by criminal actors. And part of the challenge is to prevent the transformation of privacy and personal autonomy and freedom from becoming only the privileges of the wealthy. Read more: Obfuscate yourself! Because the people who need privacy most are already vulnerable and lack power. The people able to opt-out of a privacy-destroying technology and other invasive systems are people who are rich, people who are already in a good place. And what's pertinent about digital cash, and which often gets lost, is the ability to have money that is not being used against you - that's an important component of a free society.

Those benefits are aggressively data managed, and they are only good for certain things and not others. So, you don't really have money, you have tokens. And you can easily imagine dystopian situations where you could use data about money to seize assets belonging to people of certain ethnic or religious communities, or people engaging in practices deemed unacceptable, such as sex workers who are driven back into the hands of pimps when payment systems look for data about their activities and then freeze their assets. We pay a very high social price when we lose the ability for money to be private. And that again turns privacy and assets into something that only belong to the wealthy and leaves everyone else in a vulnerable position. Finn Brunton is an assistant professor in the Department of Media, Culture and Communication at New York University. ""Digital Cash"" is published by Princeton University Press. Introduced in 2009, Bitcoin was the world's first decentralized digital currency. It quickly gained traction amid lingering uncertainty in the wake of financial crisis. Designed to be as rare as gold, Bitcoin was created to have a maximum of 21 million ""coins."" Initially worth just a fraction of a cent, by February 2011 the currency had gained parity with the US dollar, then it really took off. The name Satoshi Nakamoto is synonymous with Bitcoin. It is said to be the alias for an unknown IT whizz who invented the cryptocurrency. But despite claiming to be a 30-something Japanese national, it is generally thought that several computer science experts created the technology behind the digital coin. One rumor even suggested that Tesla chief Elon Musk is the real Satoshi, which he denied. Instead of being printed like dollars and euros, each Bitcoin is created on a global network of computers and verified by the system rather than a bank. There are no transaction fees. The smallest amount you can buy is a ""Satoshi"" or one-hundred-millionth of a Bitcoin. Purchases can be made anonymously and even at digital currency ATMs. When you buy Bitcoin, it is often stored in a digital wallet. To ensure that not too much Bitcoin comes into circulation, a process called mining was created where blocks of transactions could only be processed once a difficult math problem was solved by geeks. The puzzles are becoming so complex that bigger and bigger computers are being utilized to decipher them. That's led to concerns about the amount of electricity used to handle Bitcoin transactions. Due to its anonymous nature, Bitcoin's success is likely being fueled by organized crime, including money laundering and the purchase of illegal goods. The currency is also being targeted by cybercriminals. A recent hack blamed on North Korea forced a South Korean digital currency exchange into bankruptcy. Reports suggest the ""Islamic State"" armed group used Bitcoin to receive funds to buy arms. Bitcoin is the largest of all the cryptocurrencies and its incredible rise has spawned many imitators. Other large digital cash creators include Ethereum, Zcash, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple and Litecoin. As of November 2017, their number had swelled to 1,324. Hundreds of others have attempted and failed to launch their own digital coins. The market is now coming under increasing scrutiny by regulators. 2017 was a stratospheric year for Bitcoin. Worth close to $1,000 in January, some twelve months later it had scaled to an all-time high of $19,784. Despite much skepticism, the currency started to see serious interest from institutional investors. Two exchanges began Bitcoin futures trading, allowing speculators to punt on the incredible volatility in the value of the cryptocurrency. From central banks to respected investors, almost the entire financial establishment warned of a massive Bitcoin bubble, which they said can only end in disaster for holders of the digital currency. Among them was Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz who said Bitcoin ""ought to be outlawed."" Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase labeled those who buy the currency ""stupid."" Just before Christmas 2017, Bitcoin saw a dramatic rally, topping out at nearly $20,000 before losing a third of its value in just five days. More intense volatility followed early in the New Year, only to be reversed when it plummeted by almost half. Are we in for an even bigger rollercoaster ride if Wall Street adopts Bitcoin?

"a-49545631"|"https://www.dw.com/en/male-or-female-is-our-sex-always-clearly-defined/a-49545631"|""|"Swarms of yellow bluehead wrasse females make their way through the coral reefs of the Caribbean. The name of the fish stems from the blue head of the only male in the swarm. As soon as the male dies, the largest female turns into a new male. It can change its behavior in 10 minutes, its sex in 10 days. Without any difference in the genes, it gets a blue head and its ovary becomes a testis. Researchers from Australia, New Zealand and the US have just found out how this works. A chemical signal is emitted activating certain genes and deactivating others, explains researcher Jenny Graves from the Australian La Trobe University in Melbourne. Around 500 other fish species can change their sex in adulthood as well. Some reptiles have been shown to change sex as embryos in the egg. At a certain temperature, females hatch, while males hatch at another. The change in temperature activates or deactivates certain genes. No natural gender change has been detected in mammals. But studies with mice show that when researchers activate certain genes in the testicular, cells can transform into ovarian cells. Send Facebook Twitter google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/2biFd Gender determination is more complicated than expected Even for humans, sex is not always clearly defined. Typically, there is the male XY chromosome pair and the female XX chromosome pair. But chromosomes do not determine sex alone. Scientists assume that there are about 1000 genes that can influence the sex. ""And then there's the regulation of genes, hormones, hormone receptors, testicles, ovaries, and external genitalia|"" says Heinz-Jürgen Voß, biologist and social scientist at Merseburg University of Applied Sciences. These different parameters are not always only female or only male. Biologists speak of a spectrum at the end of which there are only male or only female characteristics. There are people who have male XY chromosomes but still have female sexual characteristics. This can lead to deviations that are often not noticed at all. In the International Journal of Surgery Case Reports, surgeons in Kashmir, India, report the operation of a 70-year old man's hernia in which they found a uterus and fallopian tubes. The father of four was completely unaware of his uterus until then. There are also people with XX chromosomes but external male genitals and testicles. Rare are people with testicles and ovaries, a uterus and a prostate as well as a penis and a vagina. Send Facebook Twitter google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/2mavC Not male, not female - then what? People whose sex-defining parameters are not completely male or female are described as intersexual. Experts say this applies to 0.05 to 1.7 percent of the global population - depending on definition and estimation. To compare, less than two percent of the world's population has red hair. However, intersexuality does not necessarily mean that they are attracted to both sexes. Intersexual also does not mean the same as transsexual. Transsexuals have a distinct biological sex but feel they are not in the ""right"" body. Around 1900 medical operations are performed annually in Germany on intersexual children under the age of 10 in order to assign a clear sex. The number has not decreased since 2005, says sociologist Ulrike Klöppel. ""Later in life, many intersex people who underwent operations as a child struggle with their assigned gender and still cannot fit into one of two categories,” says Voß. Sex is therefore not always clearly male or female. But in many countries intersexuality is not legal. In Germany, a law was passed this year that allowed people for the first time to enter ""diverse"" as their official sex. Since 2013, it has been permitted to leave the gender designation open for a newborn. In 2017, the Federal Constitutional Court decided this situation would violate personality rights and the anti-discrimination law. Now, at the age of 14, all Germans can register their sex as ""diverse."" Hans Jürgen Voß would like for every person to be able to register their gender themselves without a medical proof of intersexuality. This is the case in Argentina and Malta, for example. He says if that many different factors influence gender, the own perceived gender identity would be the strongest parameter. ""Everyone should just be asked so they can decide for themselves,” Voß concludes. ""Hey, I'm the boss here!"" screams the colorful nose of the male Mandrill Ape - dominant males crow with brighter colors than those of inferiors. When a Mandrill gets mad or aroused, the blue parts on its nose glow even stronger. The red color stems from the Mandrill's high blood circulation, the blue results from the light breaking on its skin. Elephants trumpet, smell, grab, fight and even snorkel with their nose. Strictly speaking the elephant's trunk is a fusion of nose and upper lip. It also serves for communication, for example, when flehmening. That's a way to pick up scent or pheromones, which is especially important during mating season for males. Not only can the elephant smell its adored female's odor, but it can also taste it. The sea elephant got its name from its bulging nose, which may remind you of an elephant's trunk. It dangles down over the animal's muzzle. During mating season the male pumps up his mouth with blood and air and gives off a loud noise to chase away its rivals. But both males and females absorb moisture through their noses - especially when fasting during mating season. One of the triggerfish's favorite dishes is sea urchins. So to ensure it doesn't get stung, the triggerfish developed a long ""nose."" To get to the soft and tasty interior of a sea urchin, the fish (the one in the photo is called Picasso) blows a strong jet of water on its prey, or clutches one sting with its mouth, and uses it to lift up the urchin and attack. What looks like a terribly long nose is actually the snout of the Giant Anteater. Its actual nose is at the very tip of it, and snoops in nooks and crannies for food - mostly ants and termites. When it finds a tasty morsel, the anteater stretches out a 90 centimeter-long (35 inches) gluing tongue and sticks its prey to it - 160 times per minute! The plug socket-like nose of a pig may look ugly to some, but it is very sensitive. It senses, feels, and smells scents up to 50 cm deep in the soil. Pigs have even more olfactory cells than the fine-nosed dog. That's why they are great truffle tracers. Sows are especially good at it - the smell of the precious mushrooms is very close to that of male pigs' pheromones. Pug-nosed dogs are a human creation. They're nearly square in shape, and said to have been first reared in China centuries ago as an exclusive privilege of the emperor. Later it accompanied noble ladies in paintings. People have bred pug dogs for entertainment, but the dog suffers - its respiratory organs are highly contracted, giving it its characteristic panting and leading to illness.

"a-47539037"|"https://www.dw.com/en/japanese-space-probe-hayabusa-2-second-touchdown-on-asteroid-ryugu/a-47539037"|""|"Japan's Hayabusa 2 space probe made its second touchdown on a distant asteroid on Thursday June 11, in a bid to collect mineral samples that could reveal more about the solar system's evolution. Already on February 22, the ""Falcon 2"" had touched down on asteroid Ryugu for the first time. Then, Hayabusa 2 touched down briefly on the Ryugu asteroid, fired a bullet into the surface to puff up dust for collection and blasted back to its holding position, said officials from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). Later, in April, the space probe fired another bullet at the asteroid, stirring up more dust and creating a crater. ""We've collected a part of the solar system's history|"" project manager Yuichi Tsuda said at a jubilant press conference hours after the successful landing was confirmed. ""We have never gathered sub-surface material from a celestial body further away than the Moon. We did it, and we succeeded in a world first."" The fridge-sized probe made its second landing on the asteroid at around 10:30 a.m. in Japan (0130 GMT), with officials from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) breaking into applause and cheers as initial data suggested the touchdown had been a success. Confirmation of the landing came only after Hayabusa 2 lifted back up from the asteroid and resumed communications with the control room. Research director Takashi Kubota told reporters that the touchdown operation was ""more than perfect."" And Tsuda, with a grin, said he rated it ""1,000 points out of 100."" ""The probe moved perfectly and the team's preparation work was perfect|"" he said. Hayabusa 2 had blasted off in December 2014 on a 3.2 billion-kilometer journey (equivalent to roughly 80,000 trips around the Earth's circumference) to Ryugu, which is named after a mythical Japanese underwater castle. The probe carried several landers that touched down on the asteroid in 2018 and collected information. Among them: the ""Mobile Asteroid Surface Scout"" (MASCOT) landing vehicle, built by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and the French space agency CNES, that took images, investigated minerals, gauged surface temperatures and measured magnetic fields on the asteroid. Samples from outer space Hayabusa 2's mission is to collect asteroid dust and rocks to bring back to Earth. Researchers hope the information gathered will help them understand more about the origins of our universe. An earlier Hayabusa mission from 2003 to 2010 was unable to collect as many samples as hoped from a different space rock, but still made history by being the first mission to bring back samples from an asteroid. If all goes well, Hayabusa 2 will return to Earth with soil and rock samples in 2020, according to JAXA. cb/fs (AFP, dpa) This twin team travelled through space together for 10 long years. In late summer 2014 spacecraft Rosetta and its lander Philae reached their target - Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. In ever smaller orbits they were circling the celestial object - until the time was ripe for the landing operation. Rosetta's OSIRIS camera took this picture of the landing spot on September 14 from a height of 30 kilometers (19 miles). The place had to be free of rocks, hills and valleys for Philae to land safely. Also, it had to be able to get enough sun for the batteries to recharge with the small solar panels on the lander - in order to maintain radio contact to Rosetta. The original plan was that Philae lands on its three legs, fires a Harpune into the comet and fixes itself with screws into the ice and rock. The engineers from the German Aeronautics and Space Research Center (DLR) knew that this would be a tricky task. The landing was the most vulnerable part of the whole operation. Would it succeed? The great moment came at 11:57 a.m local time in Darmstadt, Germany when European Space Agency (ESA) mission control received the signal from Rosetta. Philae had successfully departed and was on the way down to its final destination. Now the lander was all on its own. Rosetta took this picture shortly after launching Philae. Now the small landing robot is slowly descending towards the comet. Philae took this picture shortly before touchdown with its ROLIS camera - 40 meters above ground. There are rocks and gravel lying around. The big boulder in the upper corner of the picture is about five meters in diameter (15 feet). When ESA received the signal that Philae had landed, the joy was huge. Shortly after that, mission control realized that everything was not just perfect: It became clear, that Philae was not properly standing on its three legs. Nonetheless, Philae generated a wealth of data from the comet - about its chemical composition and atmosphere - and transmitted it back to earth within the first days. Once his original battery charge was used up, Philae fell silent. Then it was up to the scientists to analyze the data and make their conclusions. In the meantime, Rosetta continued circling Chury and from time to time even managed to establish short connections with Philae - and send even more data to earth. The different instruments of Philae and Rosetta discovered all kinds of organic compounds. Most vapor was emitted during the fly-by at the closest proximity to the sun. This picture was taken in July and shows gas emissions. Swiss researchers from the University of Berne even found oxygen which from its nuclear composition indicated that it stemmed from the early times of the solar system. ESA and DLR engineers are continuing their efforts to establish contact with Philae. They're hoping to find more data that is currently stored on Philae. Rosetta is now closing in on Chury again. It will then probably be easier to make radio contact. Throughout the first half of 2016 scientists are hopeful that Philae may be able to get enough sun to charge its batteries again.

NASA selected Shannon Lucid, Margaret Seddon, Kathryn Sullivan, Judith Resnik, Anna Fisher, and Sally Ride as their first female astronaut candidates in January 1978. A number of American women passed the astronaut selection process in the early 1960s but were not eligible to go into space because they had not completed military jet test pilot training — a career that was unavailable to women. The first American woman in space was due to go on a third mission before the infamous Challenger disaster cut short her training in 1986.

"a-49542150"|"https://www.dw.com/en/what-causes-uncontrollable-cramps-or-shaking/a-49542150"|"Alexander Freund"|"Shaking or cramp attacks can be very disturbing. The afflicted person can suddenly lose control of parts or all of his or her body. Sometimes such shaking or cramping can cause the person to fall to the ground and even lose consciousness. Symptoms can vary. Sometimes they appear together, in other cases they may occur in isolation. Attacks can last for seconds or even minutes before they subside, often when a person begins moving. Numerous causes Dehydration, or lack of fluids, is often a possible cause. The human body consists of roughly 70% water, and the brain as much as 90%. Water furnishes our cells with nutrients and oxygen, while at the same time washing away waste through our kidneys. Read more: Does Parkinson's disease develop in the stomach? If a person does not drink enough water, sweats profusely, or loses fluids through vomiting or diarrhea, it disrupts the body's fluid balance. If fluids are not quickly replenished, the blood thickens and the entire body goes into a state of alarm, and thus begins to cramp or shake. Send Facebook Twitter google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/3DRSv The risk of dehydration is especially high among children or elderly people. As the sensation of thirst subsides as we age, older people simply don't realize they lack fluids. Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, can also cause cramps. For instance, an individual that has strained their body, suffers pain, is exhausted, or drinks too much caffeine may suffer violent shaking, a phenomenon known as physiological tremor. When the body is cold, muscles begin to twitch in order to create warmth and keep an individual from going into hypothermia. That is why we shiver as soon as our body temperature sinks below 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit). A possible sign of serious illness Yet the causes of cramping or shaking can also be illness related. Often such fits are a symptom of epilepsy. But they may also be caused by circulatory disturbances or damage to the brain or the cerebral membrane. Epileptic fits are ""unprovoked|"" meaning they have no obvious cause, and are recurring. They may, in part, be caused by brain illness, stroke, or tumors — a phenomenon known as symptomatic epilepsy. Nonepileptic cramp attacks occur when the brain is irritated, for instance by medicine, infection, or fever. Shaking while at rest, or when moving When such tremors occur is also key, that is, whether they happen if a person is still or in motion. If shaking disrupts a person's motor skills, causing them to sway or walk in an unusually broad-legged fashion, it could be an indication of brain damage. Send Facebook Twitter google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/38HuK However, sometimes shaking occurs when a person is at rest, making it impossible to tighten certain muscles in order to keep them still. The most common form of such resting tremors is Parkinson's disease. More common still, are so-called essential tremors. These are likely hereditary, neurological motor disorders that appear between the ages of 20 and 60 and become worse over time. The symptoms of essential tremors are most readily seen when an individual is forced to maintain a stressful body position for a long period of time, or when one wants to make a specific movement. Symptoms often affect the hands or arms, and sometimes the head and even the voice. Comprehensive rather than remote diagnosis Relaxation exercises can often help a person avoid cramps, as stress and tension can make shaking worse. Alcohol and caffeine should also be avoided. However, if a person suffers from illness-related tremors it can be a sign of a more serious disease. Read more: Does nicotine actually help protect against Parkinson's disease? Ultimately, only comprehensive diagnoses, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computer tomography (CT), or electroencephalography (EEG) can provide clarity.

We all know that. We have special sensory cells that react to the cool white light and control the body's day-night rhythm. While the natural light actually becomes weaker and more yellowish in the evening hours, the light from the smartphone delays melatonin production, for example. This means it's more difficult to fall asleep and sleep deeply, and we don't feel as rested the next day. But we have accepted that — and keep staring at our smartphones, tablets and computers. Who needs sleep when you can be online 24/7? In any case, this might apply to the majority of us, right? Send Facebook Twitter google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/2aTwy But let's get to the point. The blue light might trigger something else: a craving for sugar! A new study shows that rats exposed to blue light for an hour in the evening consume more sugar. As a result, their blood sugar levels rise and glucose tolerance changes. Researchers led by Anayanci Masís-Vargas and colleagues from the University of Strasbourg and the University of Amsterdam have demonstrated this correlation in male rats. Read more: Smartphone addiction messes up brain chemistry Annoying blue light The study was presented at the annual conference of the Society for the Study of Ingestive Behavior (SSIB) in the Dutch city of Utrecht. In their study, the team changed the rhythm of the the typical nocturnal laboratory rats in order to better model human light exposure. This means that the animals were awake during the day and slept at night. The researchers exposed the rats to the disturbing white-blue light for an hour at night. The rats were given the opportunity to choose between a balanced midnight snack — their regular rodent food — or to prefer a mixture of water, lard and sugar water. The researchers observed that the male animals drank more sugar during the night when they were exposed to blue light than they did during the nights without blue light. Read here: Is the future of health technology already in our hands? Yummy sugar! In addition, glucose tolerance was altered in male rats, a warning sign of type-2 diabetes. Doctors speak of this when blood sugar levels are too high. Earlier research had already shown a strong connection between obesity and artificial light at night. That's because much of the artificial light we are exposed to today comes from LED lights and LED screens that emit a high level of blue light. The retinal cells of the eye are particularly sensitive to this blue light and transmit information directly to the appetising areas of the brain. Send Facebook Twitter google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/3EZAQ Be consistent This particular study in conjunction with previous work clearly shows that blue light at night is disturbing and that the use of the screen at night can increase our craving for sweet treats — and impair our ability to process this sugar, especially in men. Although the rats were tested after only one night's exposure to light, this could lead to weight gain and diabetes over time, the researchers said. ""Limiting the amount of time that we spend in front of screens at night is, for now, the best measure to protect ourselves from the harmful effects of blue light"", concludes Masís-Vargas. In case it's necessary to be exposed to devices at night, he would recommend the use of apps and night mode features on the devices, which turn the screens more orange and less blue or the use of blue light filtering googles that are already available on the market. Sugar is converted to fat in the body about two to five times more quickly than starches. In other words, when we consume sugar, we’re feeding our fat cells. The fructose in sugar is also metabolized by the liver, which can contribute to fatty liver disease. That can promote insulin resistance and lead to Type 2 diabetes – with a lifelong impact on your health. In small amounts, sugar promotes the release of serotonin, a hormone that boosts mood. But too much sugar can promote depression and anxiety. Sudden shifts in blood sugar levels can also lead to irritability, anxiety and mood swings. We already know that sugar has a variety of health effects, but it also affects the skin. That’s in part due to glycation, the process whereby sugar molecules bind to collagen fibers. As a result, the collagen fibers lose their natural elasticity. Excess sugar also damages microcirculation, which slows cell turnover. That can promote the development of wrinkles, make you look older than your age. The microflora of your gut promote digestion and protect your digestive system from harmful bacteria. Consuming too much sugar gets your gut microflora out of whack. Fungi and parasites love sugar. An excess of the Candida albicans yeast can lead to a host of annoying health symptoms. And sugar also contributes to constipation, diarrhea and gas. In overweight people, the brain responds to sugar by releasing dopamine, in much the same way that it responds to alcohol or other addictive substances. Test it yourself: avoid all sugary foods and beverages for ten days. If you start to get headachy and irritable after a day or two, and start craving sugar, then you could be suffering from sugar withdrawal. People who consume excess sugar are more likely to engage in aggressive behavior. Children with ADHD are also affected by sugar. For these children, too much sugar affects concentration and promotes hyperactivity. That’s why it’s a good idea for children to avoid eating sugar during school hours. Excessive sugar consumption makes it harder for the immune system to ward off disease. After consuming sugar, the immune system’s ability to kill germs is reduced by up to 40 percent. Sugar also saps the body’s store of vitamin C, which white blood cells need to fight off viruses and bacteria. Sugar also promotes the inflammatory response, and even minor inflammation can trigger numerous diseases. Studies have shown that excess sugar consumption increases the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. A 2013 study showed that insulin resistance and high blood sugar values – both of which are common in diabetes – are associated with a higher risk of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s. Cancer cells need sugar to proliferate. An international research team headed by Lewis Cantley of Harvard Medical School is researching how sugar might contribute to the growth of malignant cells. He believes that refined sugar may be what causes cancer cells to develop into tumors. He’s still testing that hypothesis but recommends that even slender people consume as little sugar as possible. Excess sugar consumption may have a negative impact on memory. According to a study carried out by Berlin’s Charité University Hospital, people with high blood sugar levels have a smaller hippocampus – the part of the brain that’s key to long term memory. In the study, people with high blood sugar also performed more poorly on tests of memory than those with low blood sugar levels."|"Are you staring at your smartphone or computer screen for too long?

The American space agency landed six times on the moon. One mission — Apollo 13 — was aborted, with that famous line, ""Houston we've had a problem."" An understatement after an oxygen tank blew up. But all-in-all it was a monumental time for Western politics, science and technology. Rockets got built, flags got waved and astronauts brought 382 kilograms of lunar rocks and other soil samples back to Earth. Read more: From Apollo 11 to the new space race The astronauts will need something to do It's hard to imagine that science almost got overlooked.

Read more: Asteroids and comets: How to tell them apart ""The first step was the technology — beat the Russians, develop rockets and missiles|"" he says. But the scientists, including one Eugene M. Shoemaker, were getting restless. So enter Max Faget, a director of engineering at NASA's Manned Spacecraft Center.

Buzz Aldrin films him on a Hasselblad camera ""So, it evolves through the program|"" Kelley continues. ""But it wasn't until Apollo 17 — the final mission — that someone with a geology background actually went to the moon."" That was Harrison Hagan ""Jack"" Schmitt. Before Schmitt, the astronauts tended to be aeronautical engineers, military men, test pilots. The sort of men — and it was all men, and true to the cliché, white men — who knew the risks of human space flight and didn't mind taking them. Tough guys. Only one other Apollo astronaut had a science background — Richard F. Gordon Jr. Gordon was the Command Module Pilot on Apollo 12. And a chemist. But he never set foot on the moon, so does he even count? Read more: When America landed on the moon, the whole world did Tough guys got good at geology. By Apollo 15 in 1971, they found a sample of the moon's primordial crust. Looks like lunar geology Those who did walk on the moon had to train in geology. And they did that in places like Texas, Hawaii, or Iceland, places of remote geological and volcanic interest. Aldrin and Armstrong examined rock samples in west Texas. They also learned how to document their trip and finds with Hasselblad cameras. The idea was to teach them how to ""see like a geologist|"" understand what the colors of different rocks mean, or how to interpret rock textures. ""And the moon is really, really simple|"" says Kelley. ""There are two main types of rock on the moon."" ""First, there's basalt that flows from volcanoes just like on Earth|"" he says. ""And the other|"" says Kelley, ""is the smashed remnants of that same material, which has been hit by thousands of meteorites and ends up in the sediment, stuck together with glass and other things."" That's called Breccia. Loads of samples The Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, Texas, lists 941 samples of Lunar rock and dust, including basalt, breccia (debris from impact craters), plutonic rocks (coarse, crystalline rocks that cooled slowly), and soil. 5.5 kilos of moon rock, collected in a rockbox of Apollo 11. Scientists can learn a lot about the history of the moon, or any planet, from a single grain of sand. A rounded grain, for instance, shows that it's been moved by water. ""You won't find a lot of rounded grains on the moon because we don't have any history of water there, except the recent history from orbiters that show there may be ice at the polar craters|"" says Robert Anderson, a geoscientist and research supervisor at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ""So, a lot of the particles on the moon are very angular, very sharp|"" Anderson says. ""You can tell they were formed when meteorites hit the moon, and that forms glass. The moon has a lot of these glass beads."" Read more: Our first InSight into the interior of Mars The astronauts practiced to scale. Armstrong sending a rockbox up to the lander. Does this explain the conspiracy theories? They don't only look pretty. They also tell scientists that if we ever want to build a moon base, astronauts will probably have to take water from Earth — for drilling or to make a kind of lunar concrete. ""We understand how hard the rocks are, so if we want to get materials from them, we know how to do that|"" says Kelley. ""There's all this physical data that they brought back during the Apollo landings."" All smiles at NASA: The first Apollo 11 sample return container, containing lunar surface material, arrives at Ellington Air Force Base From the moon to Mars Moon geology during the Apollo era meant hard labor. ""On the moon, the astronauts went down about a meter and they did it by physical quarrying as you would on Earth. It was very difficult, with a spacesuit on and one-sixth gravity and all the laws of Newton acting on it|"" says Anderson. Things are a little different on Mars. Anderson helped develop a drill for NASA's Mars Science Laboratory (MSL), a spacecraft which landed a rover called Curiosity on the Red Planet in 2012. It has delivered useful data, including the apparent presence of clay, which tends to form in water. But it had its geological challenges too. ""One of the problems we had on the MSL drill was that a lot of the drilling on Earth is done with fluids to remove heat and to remove the cutting|"" Anderson says. ""But you can't do that on planetary surfaces, because if you added water it would bubble off like a rocket exhaust."" InSight is a $1 billion international project. It includes a German mechanical mole that will burrow down 16 feet (5 meters) to measure Mars' internal heat. The lander also has a French seismometer for measuring quakes, if they exist on our smaller, geologically calmer neighbor. Because of the distance between Earth and Mars, it took eight minutes for confirmation to arrive. The three-legged InSight landed on the western side of Elysium Planitia, the plain that NASA was aiming for. Project manager Tom Hoffman said the spacecraft landed close to the bull's-eye, but NASA did not have yet have the final calculations. The 800-pound (360-kilogram) InSight is stationary and will operate from the same spot for the next two years. InSight was trailed throughout its six-month 300-million-mile (482-million-kilometer) journey by a pair of tiny satellites. The two experimental satellites not only relayed the good news in almost real time, they sent back InSight's first snapshot of Mars just 4½ minutes after landing. Up to now, the success rate at the red planet was only 40 percent. InSight reached the surface of Mars after going from 12,300 mph (19,800 kph) to zero in six minutes flat, using a parachute and braking engines. ""Landing on Mars is one of the hardest single jobs that people have to do in planetary exploration|"" said InSight's lead scientist, Bruce Banerdt. It was NASA's ninth attempt to land at Mars since the 1976 Viking probes. InSight will remain in one place during the two-year mission. The stationary 800-pound (360-kilogram) lander will use its 6-foot (1.8-meter) robotic arm to place a mechanical mole and seismometer on the ground. The mole will measure the planet's internal heat, while the seismometer listens for possible quakes. InSight has no life-detecting capability, however. That will be left to future rovers. Author: Andy Valvur But Mars does have water. ""It's not like water on Earth. But below the surface in the pores between the grains there is frozen water and perhaps CO2|"" says Kelley. ""So Martian rocks might be easier to fuse [than moon rocks], because water makes rocks fuse at lower temperatures."" More insight into Mars than the moon? Six years after Curiosity, an international team launched the InSight mission to Mars. InSight aims to drill about three meters into the planet to detect heat flows — another sign of planetary life — and tectonic activity. Astronaut? What, me? No, I'm a scientist. Aldrin, Collins and Armstrong view rock samples. It's another ""work in progress"" that occasionally leads people to complain that scientists should rather focus on the moon — it's closer and we've been there before. Plus, Mars missions lack that human touch — they are robotic, so we've never got anything back. But think of Mars as being on a continuum from the Earth to the moon and beyond —starting with the American and Soviet missions of the 1950s and 60s — and it starts to make a little more sense. ""Humankind has sent several sophisticated missions to Mars|"" says Kelley. ""But people still talk about putting astronauts on the planet, even though it takes such a long time to get there, and it's so dangerous, because they learnt so much by having astronauts on the moon."" One day, people may want to live on both. Perhaps. ""Once we understand the technology of getting there|"" says Anderson. And the technology to get back?

In January of the next year, the US army responded by sending up the Explorer 1 satellite (pictured above). And on July 29, 1958, the US Congress approved the creation of the National Aeronautics and Space Agency, or NASA. The agency opened its doors on October 1. NASA managed to land humans on the surface of the moon on July 20, 1969, just 11 years after the association's foundation. The feat was accomplished using less computing power than that possessed by the modern-day smartphone. The photo shows Neil Armstrong and Erwin Aldrin planting the US flag on the lunar surface. On April 14, 1970, an oxygen tank on the Apollo 13 spacecraft exploded, prompting astronaut James Lovell (center) to report back to NASA base in Texas: ""Houston, we've had a problem."" The crew made it back to Earth after a risky repair operation. Lovell's phrase, slightly misquoted, was made famous by a 1995 movie, Apollo 13. The Challenger Space Shuttle was not as fortunate as Apollo 13. It exploded, killing all seven people on board, just minutes after takeoff on January 28, 1986. Famed physicist Richard Feynman eventually determined that the crash was caused by a rubber seal ring that failed in unusually cold temperatures. The Cold War rivalries between Russian and American scientists were finally buried on December 14, 1998, when the US-built Unity module and the Russian-made Zarya module docked in space. The two modules form the basis of what we now know as the International Space Station (ISS). On August 6, 2012, NASA landed the Curiosity rover on the surface of Mars. The mobile laboratory is still sending scientific findings, selfies and even tweets from Mars, albeit with a little help from its Earth-based handlers. Curiosity's data is crucial for NASA's next mission: landing humans on Mars some time in the 2030s. Author: Darko Janjevic"|"The '69 moon landing was science-free.

Read more: The science of migratory birds ""Spontaneous movement to music occurs in every human culture and is a foundation of dance|"" the study, published in Current Biology, said. Such movement ""occurs in parrots, perhaps because they (like humans, and unlike monkeys) are vocal learners whose brains contain strong auditory-motor connections|"" which gives sophisticated processing abilities, the researchers said. Dance may demonstrate 'creativity' Snowball first came to fame on YouTube a decade ago after a video of him dancing to the Backstreet Boys' ""Everybody"" was uploaded. Since then he has boogied to songs such as Cyndi Lauper's ""Girls Just Want to Have Fun"" and Queen's ""Another One Bites the Dust."" Analysis of the videos revealed that Snowball had a diverse repertoire of 14 dance movements and two composite movements. This behavior ""could be a sign of creativity|"" the study found. ""This shows for the first time that another species truly dances to human music, spontaneously and without training, just based on its own development and social interaction with humans|"" the study's senior author, Aniruddh Patel, a psychologist at Tufts University and Harvard University, told French news agency AFP. An earlier study by Patel in the same journal confirmed Snowball could bop along to the beat, but at the time, his moves consisted of head bobbing and lifting his feet, actions that have long been associated with courtship. This bizarre-looking 2-meter-wide fish baffled locals when it washed up on a beach in California in February. It turned out to be the rare hoodwinker sunfish, which wasn't officially identified until 2017 and had only been spotted in the southern hemisphere waters off near New Zealand and Australia. In fact, it's the first time this creature has been seen in the northern hemisphere in 130 years. Yes, you read that right. A deep-sea swimming sea cucumber dubbed the ""headless chicken sea monster"" (real name Enypniastes eximia) was filmed swimming off East Antarctica in 2018. It had previously only been filmed in the Gulf of Mexico. Although most sea cucumbers spend their time on the ocean floor, specimens like this one spend their days floating through the ocean, only landing to feed. This isn't your typical honey bee. Thirty eight years after its last sighting, this 3.8 cm (1.5 inch) behemoth (at least by bee standards) was found by scientists in the Indonesian jungle. It was even on the Global Wildlife Conservation's list of the top 25 ""most wanted"" species. Despite its fearsome-looking jaws, much like its smaller cousins, the bee actually prefers nectar and pollen. This creature of the deep likely inspired the myth of the ""kraken."" But it eluded scientists for decades — the first confirmed photograph of a live giant squid was taken in 2004. The above image is a still from the very first footage of the species in its natural habitat, taken in 2013. It's still not known just how big they can really grow, but the largest recorded specimen measured 13 meters, In 2015, scientists officially confirmed the discovery of a new species of mammal on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. It earned its name thanks to its piglet-like nose, the purpose of which remains a mystery. It also boasts an intimidating set of vampire-like teeth, although its diet mainly revolves around earthworms and beetle larvae. This tiny moth was found in Southern California in 2017. But it only gained media attention thanks to it's orange-tinted mop of 'hair', which bears a striking resemblance to US President Donald Trump's hairstyle. So it was given a name to match. Ironically, the moth's habitat extends through to the state of Baja California in Mexico — which could be divided by Trump's proposed border wall. There's apparently no better place to discover weird-looking creatures than the depths of the ocean. This rarely photographed sea toad was discovered during a 2009 'Deep Down Under' expedition in Australia's Coral Sea. The bottom-dwelling fish is part of the deep-sea anglerfish family, which are probably best known for dangling a bioluminescent lure in front of their mouth to catch their prey. It might not be an animal, but the discovery of this unique plant in Japan 2017 sparked interest around the world. It's one of the very few species of plant which have essentially abandoned the process of photosynthesis, instead feeding off the roots of host fungi, such as mushrooms or even mould. Flora in Japan is very well documented, making this unexpected discovery particularly special. A new species of beetle was found in a cave in Guangxi Province, China in 2018. Its long, compact body, spindly legs and total lack of eyes or wings make it a prime example of a species which has evolved to live its life in complete darkness — also known as convergent evolution. While the microscopic tartigrade has been known to science since 1777, a new species was found in 2018 — in a parking lot in Japan of all places. A researcher plucked a piece of moss from the concrete and took it to the lab for testing. These 'water bears' are known for being practically indestructible and the new species could be descended from an ancient line.

That came close to changing this year. ""We will declare war against [Canada]|"" said Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte in April, telling a news conference he would ship back trash that had been festering for years in Filipino ports. ""I will advise Canada: your garbage is on the way. Prepare a grand reception. Eat it if you want to."" The Philippines sent 69 containers of waste back to Canada at the end of June, after a five-year spat that symbolizes rising anger in Southeast Asia about imports of dirty waste. The shipment arrived weeks after Indonesia and Malaysia sent waste they say was contaminated back to Europe and the US. In all three cases, the country returning the trash said it had been labelled as recyclable — despite containing other rubbish such as used diapers and household waste. ""We will not be bullied by developed countries|"" Malaysian environment minister Yeo Bee Yin told reporters in April. ""We will fight back."" Malaysia is sending back thousands of tonnes of contaminated plastic waste When China stopped importing plastic waste for recycling at the beginning of 2018, several countries in Southeast Asia, as well as Turkey and India, moved to fill the gap. But without China, the industry, whose worth the Bureau of International Recycling estimates at €177 billion ($200 billion), has been overwhelmed. Many countries don't have enough plants to process the hundreds of thousands of metric tons of recyclable waste they receive. This, together with lax international rules around trading waste, and weak enforcement in some countries, has turned Southeast Asia into a ""dumping ground"" for Western waste, NGOs say. Some plastic exports destined for recycling make their way into rivers, oceans and landfill sites, or are burned in open fires that release toxic fumes. Now, some countries are pushing back. Illegal plastic recycling factories have sprung up in southeast Asia Thailand will ban foreign plastic waste by 2021, with Vietnam to follow suit by 2025. Malaysia, which took the largest share of such trash after China's import ban, has cracked down on illegal plants burning plastic without a permit. But environmentalists fear further bans may divert waste elsewhere. ""We welcome efforts by countries to announce import bans|"" said Heng Kiah Chun, a campaigner at Greenpeace Malaysia. ""But if one country announces an import ban, the exporters will still look for an alternative — if you want to solve the problem, you have to cut it at the source."" Here to stay In 1950, the world made about two million metric tons of plastic, a review in 2017 found. By 2015, that had risen to 380 million, with just 20% of the plastic discarded that year being recycled. The rest was either burnt or thrown away. Richer countries often store thrown-away plastic in secure landfills, which reduces the risk of it leaking into waterways. But many low- and middle-income nations lack even this. Some countries across Asia and sub-Saharan Africa fail to properly manage 80% or more of their plastic garbage, the researchers found, leaving rivers and oceans at risk of pollution and endangering wildlife. Environmental campaigners have demanded a global ban on plastics that are used once and then thrown away. They have also called on companies to redesign packaging and take on costs of recycling. Diverting waste exports — instead of reducing it or recycling it at home — runs the risk for businesses of having ""a branded bottle floating past a dead sea turtle|"" said Will Nichols, head of environment at risk analyst Verisk Maplecroft. ""The other options these countries have is investing in waste processing and recycling domestically."" Plastic waste in Southeast Asia has polluted water, damaged lungs and led to crop death Recycling plants have been overwhelmed since China introduced a plastic import ban A report published by Greenpeace in April found that global plastic exports dropped by about half between 2016 and 2018, when China introduced its import ban, leaving former exporters with a surplus of waste. ""The Chinese regulations are painful in the short-term but helpful in the long-term|"" said Arnaud Brunet, director general of the Bureau of International Recycling. ""It's painful because it's very disruptive and everything we see happening today is a consequence of the Chinese regulation changes: The market is very disrupted, it affects the prices, it affects certain countries overwhelmed by quantities."" ""But in the longer term it forces the recycling industry and the exporting countries to invest [in infrastructure]... and reach a higher quality of recycling|"" he said. A tightening of laws may make that more likely. 80 plastic bags were found in the stomach of a whale in Thailand last year In May, 180 countries amended the Basel Convention regulating the global waste trade, forcing companies to get permission from the countries they are exporting to before shipping plastic waste that can't be recycled. The US, the world's biggest plastic exporter, did not sign the amendment. A spokeswoman for the Canadian environment department told DW via email that the amendments to the Basel Convention, which take effect in 2021, will help the environment by limiting exports of non-recyclable plastic waste to countries that can't manage them properly. A 2016 amendment to Canadian regulations means a permit would now be needed to make a shipment like the one that was returned from the Philippines at the end of June. Plastic is lightweight, durable — and wildly popular. We've produced 8.3 billion metric tons of the material since mass production began in the 1950s. Because it doesn't easily biodegrade, much of what we've made now lives in landfills like this one on Nairobi's outskirts. Rubbish pickers there hunt for recyclable plastics to earn a living. But a lot of plastic also ends up in the ocean ... Some 90 percent of plastic enters marine habitats via just 10 rivers: The Yangtze, the Indus, Yellow River, Hai River, the Nile, the Ganges, Pearl River, Amur River, the Niger, and the Mekong. These rivers run through highly populated areas with a lack of adequate waste disposal infrastructure. Here, a fisherman in the Philippines removes a fish and crab trap from plastic-filled waters. Some animals have found uses for plastic waste. This swan nested in garbage on a Copenhagen lake that is popular with tourists. Her cygnets hatched surrounded by waste. It's not the best start to life. But for some animals the consequences are much worse ... Although plastic is highly durable and can be used for products with a long lifespan, such as furniture and piping, about 50 percent goes to disposable products, including single-use cutlery and six pack rings that end up in the natural environment. Animals, like this penguin, are in danger of becoming entangled and dying as a result. Other animals mistake the material for food. This albatross chick was found dead on Sand Island in Hawaii with multiple pieces of plastic in its stomach. According to one study of 34 seabird species in northern Europe, Russia, Iceland, Svalbard, the Faroe Islands, Scandinavia and Greenland, 74 percent had ingested plastic. Eating the material can lead to organ damage and blockages in the gut. Even larger animals aren't immune to the effects of consuming plastic. This whale was found struggling to breathe and swim in a Thai canal. As rescuers attempted to save the animal, it vomited five plastic bags and later died. During the necropsy, vets found 80 shopping bags and other plastic garbage had clogged up the whale's stomach, so the marine creature could no longer digest nutritious food. We're well aware of the large pieces of plastic bobbing on the ocean's surface, as is pictured here off the Hawaiian coast. But did you know, trillions of tiny particles less than 5 millimeters in diameter are also floating around in there? These particles end up in the food chain. Sea plankton, which are an important source of food for fish and other marine animals, have been filmed eating them. Tentative measures to cut down on disposable plastic have already been taken in some African countries with bans on plastic bags, while the European Union is looking into prohibiting single-use plastic products. But if current trends continue, scientists believe there will be 12 billion metric tons of plastic on the planet by 2050.

"a-49556942"|"https://www.dw.com/en/environmental-protection-the-biggest-problem-is-greed-says-conservationist-jane-goodall/a-49556942"|"Sam Baker"|"In 1960, at the age of 26, Jane Goodall ventured to Gombe Stream National Park in Tanzania to study chimpanzees. Her discoveries were groundbreaking and her approach to fieldwork was revolutionary. She immersed herself in the chimps' daily lives and gave them names. Since then, Goodall has become a tireless advocate for conservation, in addition to being one of the world's best-known primatologists. In 1977, she founded the Jane Goodall Institute, which works around the world to protect wildlife and the environment, but also improves the lives of people in order to further conservation efforts. DW: Why do you think it is that some people lack hope or aren't moved to take action to protect the environment? Jane Goodall: The biggest problem is greed. People want more and more and more — more than they need. Companies want to grow bigger and bigger and bigger and gobble up the competition. And the gap between the haves and the have-nots is getting bigger all the time, causing resentment and anger, rightly so. Speaking of that, a lot of your environmental work focuses on lifting people out of poverty. What led you to connect this social justice work with more traditional conservation efforts? It was back in 1986, when I realized that chimpanzees' numbers in Africa were decreasing and habitat was being destroyed. I decided I should go to a different range of countries and learn more about it, which I managed to do. But at the same time, I was learning about the plight of so many people living in and around chimpanzee habitat: the crippling poverty, the lack of good health and education, the destruction of the environment. Read more: 10 facts you probably didn't know about great apes Goodall was the first to discover that like humans, chimps use tools Because when you're very poor, you cut down the last trees to try and desperately grow some more food or make charcoal. It was when I flew over that tiny Gombe National Park and saw what had been part of a great equatorial forest belt stretching from East to West Africa (and that was in 1960). By 1990 when I flew over, it was just a tiny island forest surrounded by completely bare hills and people were struggling to survive. That's when I realized if we don't help the people to find other ways of living than destroying the environment, then we can't even try to help the chimps. And so we began our Jane Goodall Institute TACARE program (take care, T-A-C-A-R-E) and there were a few NGOs at the time sort of handing out bits and pieces to local communities, but we did it rather differently. We selected a small group of local Tanzanians — seven of them — and they went into the villages and asked the people 'What can JGI do to help?' and that's where we began. A lot of your work and the program, Roots & Shoots, focuses on children and young people. Can you give us some examples of projects that students have done throughout the years that give you hope for the future? First let me say that that program that began with 12 high school students, is now in about 60 countries with about 150,000 active groups. We've got members in kindergarten and university and everything in between. Goodall became famous following the National Geographic/CBS special ""Miss Goodall and the Wild Chimpanzees"" in 1965 The students themselves choose three projects: one to help people, one to help animals, one to help the environment. Because we try and bring them together as much as possible, even if usually it's just virtually, they come to understand that we may have different colored skin, come from different cultures and different religions, but actually underneath we're all human beings. We're all one family. So some projects? Well, all around the globe, they're planting trees, which they decide to do. Many of them are working very hard to eliminate plastic and to teach about recycling — huge projects on those things going on in China. They sometimes raise money in very imaginative ways and that can be to help a shelter for stray dogs or it can be to help refugees in another country or the same country and it can be for earthquake victims. It's just as varied as the young people themselves. They choose different projects depending on what country they're in. Sometimes it has to be politically sensitive, what they do. It depends if they're rich or poor, and it depends on their age. What do you wish more people knew about animals? That animals like us have feelings, that they have personalities, that they can feel happy or sad, that they can feel pain and fear and despair. And that they're so much more intelligent than we used to think.

These are the giant forest rats and they've been credited with helping to make Mozambique landmine free. I met so many people from Mozambique who'd lost a leg or a foot from treading on the landmine after the Civil War. Rats are so intelligent. Octopus can make houses for themselves out of empty clam shells. They take them to where they want to go hunting if there are no rocks because they need rocks to hide in. So they take two empty clam shells with them and then get into one half and pull the other over their head. Birds can make tools. You know, all these things we're finding out — it's a very exciting time. How do you think we as humans can regain our connection to the natural world and better understand our place in it? That's what we hope to do through Root and Shoots — give children an opportunity to be out in nature. Once they get out in nature, they love it, especially the little ones. We need the natural world for our good psychological health. We actually need green and to be out in nature. What do you think is the single most important thing people can do to preserve our planet? I think that each day people must understand that their life is making a difference and they should start thinking about the consequences of the little choices they make. Goodall was named a United Nations Messenger of Peace in 2002 Like, what do you buy? Where does it come from? Did it harm the environment? Did it result in animal cruelty, like the factory farms? Is it cheap because of child slave labor? You start making ethical choices — let's not use plastic, let's recycle, let's reuse, let's not throw away, let's not waste food. Yes, the big corporations and governments can make huge differences, but at least in democracies, the people are responsible for who is elected into power. And if you don't like the way a business works, the consumer has a huge responsibility because if you don't like the way it's made, don't buy it. That's another reason for eliminating poverty because if you're really poor, you can't choose. You just have to buy the cheapest. So the most important message is: what do you do each day, and how do you make the most use, and can you go to sleep thinking, 'I made the world a little bit better today'? And people do that in different ways. I should just finally say that if you fly over Gombe today, you wouldn't see bare hills because the people have understood that preserving the environment is for their own future as well as wildlife. The trees have come back. It's nice to see those hopeful situations. That's the only reason I keep going. I meet amazing people and I see incredible projects everywhere. This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity. All seven species of great apes share the following characteristics: no tail, a large skull with a large brain, a curved spine and an opposable or prehensile thumb. Like the chimpanzee, which is at home in central Africa and known for its often aggressive behavior. The Bonobo, or pygmy chimpanzee, is a really peaceable ape. ""Make love, not war"" is its motto. Bonobos use frequent sex to ease tension in the group; they are also into French kissing and oral sex. Bonobos only live in the Democatic Republic of Congo. There are two species of orangutans: one lives on the island of Borneo, the other on Sumatra. Both live on trees, have very long arms and hand-like feet that they use for climbing. Bornean orangutans are squat, they are heavier than their cousins on Sumatra, and their fur is darker and longer. The Sumatra orangutan's fur is more reddish than that of the Borneo orangutan, the males' cheek pads are less pronounced and often covered in white hair. Sumatra orangutans also spend less time on the ground than their Bornean cousins. Experts suspect the reason to stay aloft may be the Sumatra tiger, which also preys on orangutans. Gorillas are subdivided into two subspecies, the Eastern and the Western gorilla. The Eastern gorilla is bigger, its fur is darker, and the species is subdivided even further into the Eastern lowland and the Mountain gorilla (photo). The Western gorilla is also subdivided, into the Western lowland (photo) and the profoundly endangered Cross River gorilla. Almost all gorillas in zoos are Western lowland gorillas. In the wild, there are far more Western gorillas than the Eastern species. The former also live in smaller groups. Is there a great ape missing? Right: We, too are great apes. We humans are more closely related to chimpanzees and bonobos than the chimps are to gorillas. But we're the only great ape species that isn't threatened by extinction.

"a-49293849"|"https://www.dw.com/en/historic-moment-for-indigenous-people-at-climate-talks-new-climate-leader-says/a-49293849"|"Sarah Steffen"|"With a profound understanding of their environmental surroundings, indigenous communities around the world are often cited as being pivotal to tackling climate change. During the 2015 Paris Agreement, the parties agreed to launch a working group to strengthen the knowledge and practices of indigenous groups and to provide a platform for the exchange of experiences and adaptation techniques. Pasang Dolma Sherpa, an indigenous leader from Nepal, has just been voted one of the two co-chairs to head the Facilitative Working Group of the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform. She spoke to DW during the The Bonn Climate Change conference, where negotiators are meeting ahead of the 25th Conference of the Parties (COP) to be held in Chile in December. DW: Pasang Dolma Sherpa, would you say indigenous people now finally have a place at the table? Pasang Dolma Sherpa: Yes, this is a historic moment. When the UNFCCC was established in 1992, indigenous peoples did not have the same forum to interact. Now, the indigenous peoples' continued hard work, their struggle, their work on the ground has been acknowledged and is reflected at the global level. And finally we have the platform, the Facilitative Working Group, at the same level as said parties to present the important role of indigenous peoples. What is the state of rights for indigenous peoples right now? In the Paris Agreement as well as at COP24 [in Katowice], it's explicitly stated that indigenous peoples' rights be enshrined by the UNFCCC, particularly rights for protecting, enhancing and continuing with traditional knowledge and cultural practices in their territories. But these rights are hardly reflected at a national level. There are so many events in the name of conservation, in the name of protection of biodiversity, cultural practices. The role of indigenous peoples has hardly been acknowledged, when in fact indigenous peoples have been contributing to sustaining and managing and protecting the ecosystem's biodiversity. This voice needs to be heard. There was a time when hippos and elephants lived in the Sahara. Today it's a barren landscape where few creatures can survive. A small lake fed by groundwater that fell to earth as rain thousands of years ago, serves to remind of times gone by. As the climate in the region changed, it led to the creation of a vast sandscape. Deserts are still forming today — often as a result of human activity. ""Desertification"" describes the transistion of fertile land to desert. It is often connected to human behavior. When people deplete natural resources — like water sources — in areas with a dry climate, plant life disappears and the soil becomes infertile. This phenomenon can be seen in 70% of the world's arid regions, such as in India, as pictured. Every year, about 70,000 square kilometres (27,000 square miles) of desert are created. That’s equivalent to the size of Ireland. According to the German development agency, GIZ, 40% of Africa's population live in areas threatened by desertification. In Asia and South America it is 39% and 30% respectively. But places such as Germany, the US and Spain are also at risk. One reason for the proliferation of deserts is population growth. In China, for example, the soil is being used to feed more and more people. Farmers crowd their pastures with animals that eat every last plant. The soil is loosened and eventually eroded by wind and rain. This creates some 2,500 square kilometers (965 square miles) of desert in the country every year. The Aral Sea on the border between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan illustrates a failed agricultural policy that led to desertification. In the past, the Aral Sea was the fourth largest lake in the world; today there is little left of it. Since Soviet times, the two neighboring countries have tapped the lake to irrigate cotton fields. Fishing boats are now stranded on land. European countries can also suffer from cracked soil and dried up waterways. In Spain, desertification is accelerating — triggered by the demand to accomodate an influx of tourists from all over the world. Whole forests are often cleared for the construction of hotels. The soil is disrupted and removed, or buried under concrete. The Guadalajara region near Madrid is particularly under threat. Desertification greatly affects lives. Without reliable sources of water and fertile soil, people struggle to survive and often have to leave places they've lived for generations. The GIZ estimates that desertification affects 485 million people in Africa. The UN predicts that more than 60 million people will have been forced to leave the desert regions of Africa by 2020. Some countries have declared war on desertification. For decades, China has been trying to counter this trend by reforesting. Its ""Great Green Wall"" project, which began in 1978, has an ambitious goal — to replenish an area the size of Germany by 2050. On the World Day to Combat Desertification, the United Nations wants to draw attention to this increasingly urgent problem. Author: Patrick Grosse (cs) Which indigenous group do you belong to? What are the most pressing issues for that group? Nepal has acknowledged 59 indigenous groups. I'm Sherpa — Sherpas mostly stay in the mountain area. They are already experiencing melting mountains — you never know when your village or your livelihood will be gone. This is the unpredictability of the consequences of climate change. Melting ice in the Himalayas has had a really severe impact and made them scared about the future. What do they tell you to take to the climate talks? Pasang Dolma Sherpa belongs to Nepal's Sherpa, which have been hit hard by climate change We really emphasize that you need to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases. Developing countries like Nepal who have contributed nothing to the causes of climate change are the ones adversely impacted by it. If someone has been hit by climate change, this is also the responsibility of other countries, especially industrial countries. We want to bring this voice to the negotiators here; why it is very, very important to decide on a minimum reduction of greenhouse gases and protect people on the ground. Almost 40% of the world's remaining intact forests are managed by indigenous people, but many don't have secure land rights or even the support of governments. How can this be changed? Land tenure is one of the very critical issues for indigenous peoples. We have been contributing to the management of resources such as forests. Taro is one of the indigenous groups living in the Terai belt of Nepal. They have been living there for generations — even before we had so-called Nepal. But after the 1950s, their customary institutions were not recognized as official entities. The Taro communities never realized that the forest, their land, had already been taken away. But now, what has happened in the name of conservation? The government's focus is more on wildlife than on the people who have been living there for generations. Are you trying to get land rights for indigenous people? I really do believe that if you want to have climate change resilience in the long term, land rights, land tenure security is the primary focus for the continuation and contribution of indigenous peoples. This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity. Of the 2 million-odd people who visit the Great Barrier Reef annually, a 2016 survey found that 69 percent were coming to see the UNESCO World Heritage site ""before it's too late."" And no wonder. The IPCC says that even if we manage to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, 99 percent of the world's coral will be wiped out. Tourists can hasten their demise by touching or polluting reefs. And what's the carbon cost of flying to remote natural wonders under threat? A 2010 study found that the business of polar-bear safaris in Churchill, Canada, had an annual CO2 footprint of 20 megatons. Most visitors arrived by plane, and while 88 percent of them said humans were responsible for climate change, only 69 percent agreed that air travel was a contributing cause. Along with the polar bear, one of the most iconic images of climate change must be the dramatic curves of an iceberg sculpted by the warming atmosphere. Gliding between the melting giants on a cruise ship is a haunting experience that tourists will pay huge sums for. In the early 1990s just 5,000 people visited Antarctica each year, compared to over 46,000 in 2018. You don't have to go to the poles to see vanishing ice. Kilimanjaro's snowy peaks are a striking sight above the equatorial savannah of the national park, which generates €44 million ($50 million) from tourism annually. Many visitors climb to the Furtwängler Glacier — where 85 percent of the ice has vanished over the last century. The rest is unlikely to survive much beyond mid-century. When Montana's Glacier National Park opened in 1910, it boasted over 100 of the ice features from which it took its name. Now, there are fewer than two dozen. So dramatic is their retreat, that the park has become a center of climate science research. Some 3 million hikers and holidaymakers also visit the ""crown of the continent"" each year, soaking in the dying days of its ice-capped glory. The Maldives are the archetypal tourist paradise: 1,200 coral islands with white beaches rising just 2.5 meters above the turquoise waters. In 2017, the president decided to build new airports and megaresorts to accommodate seven times as many tourists, and use the revenue to build new islands and relocate communities. He has since been voted out of office and faces corruption charges. It's not just islands that are going under as sea levels rise. Wetlands like Florida's Everglades are disappearing too. Over the last century, around half the Everglades have been drained and turned over to agriculture. Now, saltwater is seeping into what's left, making it the only critically endangered World Heritage site in the United States. The Galapagos will be forever associated with Darwin, who realized their unique wildlife had evolved over countless generations in isolation. Today, they are besieged by visitors and environmental changes are happening too fast for species to adapt. Ocean warming has left iconic creatures like the marine iguana starving, while UNESCO lists tourism among the greatest threats to the archipelago.

"a-49258760"|"https://www.dw.com/en/us-scraps-prison-plan-for-abandoned-coal-mine/a-49258760"|"Daniel Moattar"|"Eastern Kentucky's hills are interrupted by jarring flats of bare rock: the aftermath of mountaintop removal mining, which uses explosives to destroy and harvest coal-rich peaks. These hills are also home to four federal prisons — and until this week, an abandoned mountaintop mine in Letcher County, Kentucky, was expected to house a fifth. This week, 21 federal prisoners who had sued the bureau over the site's alleged health hazards won a surprise victory when the US Bureau of Prisons (BOP) abruptly pulled out of the proposed 1,200-bed penitentiary. Read more: As Germany phases out coal, villages still forced to make way for mining The plaintiffs — who are serving sentences ranging from one year to life imprisonment, and are incarcerated across the United States on charges including firearm and drug possession — argued in the suit that the site had been inadequately tested, that it was likely unsafe, and that the BOP had violated federal environmental laws by failing to notify them before making its decision. Mountaintop removal is associated with a wide range of illnesses, including pneumonia, bronchitis, leukemia and tumors of the lung and trachea. The Obama administration had considered using stimulus money to pay for tree planting on former surface coal mines In an email to DW, a BOP spokesperson said more analysis was needed to address ""environmental concerns|"" and declined to discuss the lawsuit's role in its decision. Debbie Chizewer, the Montgomery Foundation Environmental Law Fellow at Northwestern University, called the decision a ""victory for common sense"" and a ""recognition of the serious environmental and economic concerns"" raised by the plan's opponents. Chizewer said state agencies sometimes ""end up merely checking the box, rather than taking a meaningful or substantive analysis"" of environmental impacts and health risks. Prisoner and forest health The suit was filed in November by 14 prisoners and public-interest law firm the Abolitionist Law Center (ALC). In April, the complaint was updated to include seven other prisoner-plaintiffs and local conservationists Friends of the Lilley Cornett Woods. The Lilley Cornett Woods is a forest preserve near the planned prison site, which is home to three species of endangered bats. The group argues on its website and in legal filings that the proposal to build the prison endangered the forest with pollution, traffic and ""massive quantities of sewage and cleaning chemicals."" Central Appalachian forests like the Lilley Cornett Woods are among the world's most biodiverse and threatened, according to a 2010 New York Times report. Dustin McDaniel, ALC's executive director, believes the case is likely the first environmental lawsuit brought by incarcerated people, the first jointly filed by federal prisoners and local conservationists and the first in which US prisoners have sued to prevent construction of a new facility. ""The failure, on the part of the BOP, to perform the required environmental justice analysis was a blatant attempt to circumvent the law at inmates' expense|"" wrote Robert Black, who is incarcerated at a medium-security prison in Colorado, in communications shared by the Abolitionist Law Center.

All were built between 1992 to 2005 in hopes of offsetting the loss of coal industry jobs that once powered this region. The area's rate of labor force participation is 45%, about two-thirds the US average. It now has fewer coal jobs than at any time since 1898. Mountaintop removal has been a boon for mine operators, but generates less employment than conventional mining, and takes a harsher toll on surroundings. Operators detonate mountaintops and shunt the millions of tons of debris into neighboring valleys, forming flat plots like the planned prison site. This so-called ""valley fill"", which can include toxins such as arsenic and selenium, runs ""a high risk of contaminating public water supplies|"" said Alan Lockwood, a neurologist and coal expert with Physicians for Social Responsibility. Streams and rivers run through many valleys in Appalachia, the mountainous region where Letcher County is located. Valley fill from decades of past mining now covers thousands of kilometers of Appalachian waterways. Environmental Protection Agency tests of the proposed site found acceptable levels of heavy metals and water acidification, but ""insufficient"" cleanup of leaking natural gas equipment, and arsenic ""well above"" regional screening levels, the agency's standard for safe long-term exposure. The decline of coal has badly hit Kentucky's economy, and destroyed Appalachian mountaintops Prisons on waste sites The planned prison is not the first to raise environmental concerns. One 2017 analysis, based on work by cartographer Paige Williams, found that over 130 US prisons lie within 1.6 kilometers (about 1 mile) of a Superfund site, areas with hazardous waste or pollution severe enough to require federal government intervention. A further 600 are within 5 kilometers of such sites, and an unknown number of others sit on abandoned mines or dumps. Another Eastern Kentucky prison, USP Big Sandy, is located in a strip mining area, and at least two prisons in neighboring Southwest Virginia are on mountaintop removal sites. Public health studies indicate that residents of mountaintop removal areas suffer higher rates of medical conditions, from clinical depression to tooth loss. They live shorter lives than those living near conventional coalfields — up to 1.5 years shorter on average — are more likely to suffer birth defects and suffer from heart disease and cancer. Exploring green alternatives In place of prisons, some nearby coal-mining communities are eyeing environmentally friendly uses for abandoned mines. In nearby Pike County, the state government has backed a plan to build a 100-megawatt solar farm, Kentucky's largest ever, on mountaintop mine lands. And a wind-power study of a mountaintop removal site in neighboring West Virginia found it could generate enough power to supply 70,000 homes. Though the Bureau of Prisons could restart the testing process, and attempt to develop the site again, advocates and opponents believe that's unlikely to happen. It's been rare for environmental activists to successfully influence major government decisions in Donald Trump's White House. But Black and his fellow plaintiffs have gone some way to demonstrating the growing reach of the US environmental movement, whose activists are increasingly linking questions of emissions and energy to racial and criminal justice. This will be a melancholy and nostalgic Christmas for the people of Bottrop, especially for the last coal miners and their families. Three days before Christmas Eve, the Prosper-Haniel coal mine — the last black coal mine in Germany — is set to close. German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier was gifted the last piece of ""black gold"" to be brought up and see the light of day. The coal was initially stored outside for days, like here with the Prosper-Haniel tower in the background. Then it was usually taken by train to the nearest port where it was loaded onto barges or ships to be taken to consumers; a large portion of it was shipped overseas. German hard coal was in demand worldwide for its quality, as long as the price was right. The work in the coal mine was not only well paid, the miners were also held in high esteem. Their dirty, exhausting and dangerous work welded the miners together. Even now, they all call one another mate (""kumpel""). Their solidarity and camaraderie were always a reason for professional pride as can be seen here in this photo taken in Bottrop's Prosper-Haniel mine. The miner operators built housing for the miners in the immediate vicinity of the pits. In the gardens, workers often kept chickens and pigs. Sometimes they'd even find room for a pigeon coop. Meanwhile, these houses have become very popular. Having a garden in the city is no small luxury. After World War II, many so-called guest workers from southern Europe and Turkey came to work in the mines alongside colleagues from Silesia and Masuria, both in today's Poland. Many of them decided to stay. The 1950s and 60s were the highpoint of the Ruhr mining industry. And yet, the first cracks in the mining business model were becoming apparent. The coal, which was initially near the surface, soon had to be dug out deeper and deeper — up to 1,500 meters underground. That was very expensive and German coal gradually became less competitive on the international market. For decades the Ruhr area was notorious for its bad air. If you lived near a coking plant, freshly laundered sheets would turn dirty if you hung them out on the washing line. The image here depicts a skyline of coal, smokestacks, and smoke in Oberhausen — not far from Bottrop. Today, few people in the area miss these consequences of the coal business. Even after coal mining is discontinued, it will continue to play an important role in the lives of the people of Ruhr Valley. Time and again, the earth opens up and houses, roads or railway lines are badly damaged by the notoriously unstable ground. In the last 150 years, the Ruhr area has sunk in places by up to 25 meters (82 feet). Without intervention, the groundwater would rise again, transforming the area into a huge lake. So the water has to be pumped out — continuously. This legacy is sometimes referred to as an ""eternal cost"" for the more-than-five million people who live in the Ruhr area.

For Lorenz Keysser, 23, and Giulia Fontana, 27, it required six months of planning, 200 hours on trains and a fortnight on a cargo ship. From visiting Moscow's Red Square and hiking China's Laoshan mountain, to chugging across the Central Asian steppes, the journey felt like a privilege as well as, at times, a test of their principles. The couple don't drive or eat meat. And three years ago they decided they couldn't justify the emissions involved in flying. Lorenz was particularly surprised to discover that 60% of greenhouse gas emissions at ETH Zurich, the university where they both studied environmental science, came from business trips by air. Read more: Could eco-friendly flying be on the horizon? Giulia visited her family in Italy, and Lorenz his in Germany, by train. When Lorenz took a semester at Leeds University in the UK, he moved by train and Giulia visited him there the same way. Their vacations were to places accessible without taking to the air. ""We were only traveling in Europe, doing hikes, and so it was not a problem at all|"" Giulia says. Read more: Trains vs. planes: What's the real cost of travel? But when Giulia's best friend, who lives in Sydney, asked her to be maid of honor at her wedding, she was caught in a dilemma. On top of the world: One of the highlights of their trip was hiking China's Laoshan mountain Sharing recipes and shooting stars The couple pondered the journey and decided the time it would take meant if they went, they would stay Down Under a full year. For Giulia, that meant finding a new job in Australia, while Lorenz would work remotely on his studies. As they researched train routes and discovered it was possible to travel by cargo ship, it became clear that Giulia really could be there for her friend's special day. Lorenz says the scale of their undertaking crept up on him: ""It was a slow realization that now everything we had planned over the last months will become reality."" They set off last June, with Giulia traveling from Zurich to meet Lorenz in Berlin. They left Germany by train and traveled through Europe — from the German capital to Moscow via Poland and Belarus — then through Russia, Mongolia and China to Beijing before heading to Qingdao to catch a cargo ship to Brisbane, where they arrived six weeks later. A cargo ship docks at Qingdao, where the couple began their sea crossing to Brisbane ""Probably the most remarkable moments for us were on the cargo ship|"" Lorenz recalls. ""We got to know the crew, and the engineer showed us around in the machine room. With him and one officer we learned how to 'shoot' stars with a sextant. We celebrated birthdays with the crew, helped in the kitchen — and sang a lot of karaoke."" Giulia taught the ship's chef to make tiramisu, and Lorenz made potato salad for an onboard party from his grandmother's recipe. Members of the crew later visited them in Sydney. Another highlight was breaking their journey across Russia in Irkutsk, Siberia where they hiked along the shores of Lake Baikal. ""The forest was just so thick and luxuriant, and full of insects and butterflies|"" Lorenz says. Read more: Are cruise ships climate killers? Like any adventure to far-flung locations, the trip also meant exchanges with people with very different life experiences, such as when a group of 20-odd army recruits piled into their train carriage. ""They were very keen to get our opinions on many tricky political issues connected to Russia|"" Lorenz says. The soldiers even gave the couple a gift of coffee, chocolate and, despite protestations, tinned meat. It wasn't the only time their vegetarianism mystified locals. Struggling to understand the concept, the cook at one restaurant in China ended up taking them to the kitchen and pointing out each ingredient in the fridge in turn to check if they could eat it. The train journey between Irkutsk in Siberia and Ulaan Bataar in Mongolia was a monotony of grassy steppes A growing movement All in all, the trip cost the couple around €4,000 ($4,560) per person, most of which went to boat tickets and visas. Lorenz has calculated that the outward leg produced just over 370 kilos (816 pounds) of CO2 each. According to Lorenz's estimates using the website Atmosfair, a single economy flight from Zurich to Sydney produces 5.2 metric tons. Read more: Paying for climate protection: How CO2 offsetting for flights works But keeping their carbon budget in check took discipline. ""When we arrived in Brisbane, the cargo ship arrived directly beside the local airport|"" Lorenz says. ""We saw airplanes landing every few minutes — it was a bit like a fist in the face, saying, 'you could have done all this in less than 24 hours.'"" Now, the couple are preparing to do it all over again. Their homeward journey will begin soon with a cargo ship from Brisbane to Japan, before they take a different route back through China and Russia. Lorenz and Giulia are among 360 people who have committed to stop or limit their flying over the last two years with the No Fly Climate Sci movement. And many more people are making the same decision independently. Read more: 'Climate scientists should cut back on air travel' Since Greta Thunberg made the 32-hour train journey to Davos last year, Sweden's national rail company has upped its service to three trains a day on the Stockholm–Copenhagen–Hamburg line, and German rail company Deutsche Bahn has announced it expects train passengers on its intercity and international lines to top 150 million for the first time this year. The freighter from China to Australia offered a very different pace of travel, the claustrophobic confines of an airplane cabin exchanged for wide-open views to the horizon The privilege of tough choices Still, Giulia and Lorenz are well aware that this shift isn't happening fast enough, and are keen to communicate that the urgency of the climate crisis demands much more profound rethinking of how we run our economies. ""Although individual action is important, it's not going to be enough. We really need systemic change|"" Lorenz says. They also stress that being able to travel the way they do is a huge privilege. Just as only a tiny minority of people have the luxury of choosing to pollute our planet with airplane emissions — less than 20% of the global population have ever been on a plane — Giulia and Lorenz's trip made them realize how lucky they are, due to accidents of race, citizenship, ability, sexual orientation and class, to be able to travel freely and safely across the globe, through one national border after another. Journeys like theirs may not be the ""new normal|"" but the couple say the conversations they had with fellow travelers along the way suggest those who are able to explore the world are becoming increasingly aware of the impact they have on it. ""We are in a minority, obviously, but there are a lot of people thinking about our way of traveling|"" Giulia says. Planes powered with renewable energy don't produce CO2 or other climate-damaging emissions such as nitrogen oxide and particles. They are smaller, lighter and more efficient than planes powered by kerosene. The Alpha Electro from the Slovenian start-up Pipistrel is already proving this since 2015, when it had its maiden flight. Most companies and scientists see the future of electric planes in regional transport. The Israeli start-up Eviation plans to revolutionize commuting with their nine-seater. The prototype Alice can fly for up to 650 miles (1,000 kilometers), and will take to the sky in 2019 for the first time, according to the company. The flying taxi of the German company Lilium had its first successful flight in April 2017. The five-seater can take off and land vertically, has a reach of 190 miles and travels from London to Paris in just an hour. The goal of the company is for people to one day be able to order their flying cab via app for the price of a regular taxi ride. Some plane manufacturers don't dare go all-electric just yet. In November 2017, Airbus, Rolls-Royce and Siemens announced they will jointly develop a commercial hybrid-electric prototype. The e-Fan X will be powered by three gas turbines and one electric motor. The companies aim to replace a second gas turbine with another electric motor at a later stage. A prototype is anticipated to fly in 2020. As part of British budget airliner EasyJet's plans to become more climate-friendly, it has entered into a cooperation with the United States startup Wright Electric. The goal is to develop a completely electric-powered plane for up to 150 passengers. It's not known yet when we can expect to see a first prototype. Experts believe that we could be flying in electric planes within 20 years. Various prototypes companies are working on have a range of a 155 to 650 miles. But technology is developing at an ever-faster pace. Who knows? One day, we might be able to travel around the world in emission-free planes completely powered by renewable energy. There's hope for all environmentally conscious travel addicts!

Now one of his most famous works, The Night Watch was commissioned as a group portrait of an Amsterdam city militia. Read more: Rembrandt collector counteracts isolationism with art More than 2 million people visit the Rijksmuseum, which houses the world's largest collection of Rembrandt's works, each year. An old friend of Rembrandt's, Lievens captured the painter known for his impressive self-portraiture. The two artists, friends since childhood, shared a studio in Amsterdam until 1631, when Lievens began to travel for his career. Rembrandt, in contrast, never went abroad, although he is said to have been inspired by the Italian masters A growing middle class made portraiture a dominant style of the era, as their wealth and desire to be documented led to the commissions that supported artists. Rembrandt often used his brush to capture the likeness of family members, including his wife Saskia Uylenburgh. Her family made up a large part of his social and financial life. With marketing done mainly via word of mouth, Rembrandt had to rely on friends and collectors to drum up interest in his talent. It must have been his friend, the collector Jan Six, who led to this commission featuring the well-known physician, Arnold Tholinx. Six's brother-in-law, Tholinx was the focus of other works by Rembrandt, including a sketch that is part of the Rijksmuseum's collection. Hendrickje Stoffels moved in with the artist after the death of his wife, Saskia. After Rembrandt lost his house due to debts in 1658, his son, Titus, and Hendrickje banded together to sell the artist's paintings, a move that kept debt collectors at bay. Unable to marry Hendrickje without losing the inheritance Saskia left him, the couple simply lived together until her death in 1663. While his son, Titus, seen here at 19, worked for his father throughout his life. It wasn’t until Rembrandt went bankrupt in 1656 that Titus, together with Hendrickje Stoffels, started a gallery of the artist's work to pay off creditors. The painting, on loan for the first time for an exhibition in Europe, reflects Rembrandt's approach to portraying family and friends: informal, personal, relaxed.

Rejoiced the world has, most especially at Kaufmann's fame and glory. Flashy, high-profile and with a pervasive media presence, Kaufmann has brains and brawn, technique and charisma — and a characteristic husky tenor that goes to the heart. His 50th birthday on July 10 is being marked in more than 200 movie theaters in Germany, Austria and Switzerland with ""An Italian Night – Live from the Waldbühne|"" the film documentation of an enthusiastically-received performance Kaufmann gave at that Berlin venue in the summer of 2018.

And on July 18, Kaufmann is scheduled to sing at the Palace Festival in Regensburg — for which fans have been trading tickets priced up to €600 ($670). The busy schedule is nothing new for the star tenor. Twenty-five years on the stage and counting, Jonas Kaufmann mentioned in an interview with Der Spiegel: ""If I didn't believe that deep down inside of me, I wanted to make an impact somewhere, I would not have worked so hard all those years.

Born in Munich in 1969, the Bavarian native initially studied mathematics but eventually found himself at the Munich Academy for Music and Theater. After graduating in 1994, he sang at the Saarland State Theater in Saarbrücken for two years, gaining extended experience in lyric tenor roles. In the new millennium, Kaufmann gradually conquered the world's major opera stages, from Paris, Brussels, Milan and Munich to Salzburg, New York, London, Vienna and Berlin. Beginning with lyrical roles, he gradually progressed to the heroic tenor category: from Mozart and Verdi to Wagner — notably in his premiere at the Bayreuth Festival 2010 in the title role of Lohengrin.

Their dances celebrated fertility, but in the northeastern Brazilian state of Bahia, where most slaves ended up, the dances developed into an integral part of religious ceremonies. The Brazilian samba originated in Rio de Janeiro, a mixture of African and European musical traditions. The first samba, ""Pelo Telefone"" (""By Phone""), was officially registered on November 27, 1916, in Brazil's National Library. The carnival hit was attributed to Brazilian musician Ernesto Joaquim Maria dos Santos, known as Donga. The piano score, seen here, was written by Pixinguinha, the famous Brazilian saxophonist, singer and composer. This 1925 oil painting, by well-known Brazilian artist Emiliano Di Cavalcanti, is entitled ""Samba."" Di Cavalcanti was seen as the leader of Brazilian Modernism, and his work expressed the self-confidence of black Brazilian art. This piece was destroyed by fire in August 2012. Brazilian poet and diplomat Vinicius de Moraes (1913-1980) came up with perhaps one of the most beautiful definitions of samba. In ""Samba da Benção|"" which he composed with guitarist Baden Powell, he sang: ""A good samba is like a prayer. A good samba needs a bit of suffering, because suffering is always accompanied by a bit of hope."" De Moraes was also behind the 1959 film ""Orfeu Negro"" (""Black Orpheus""), in which he transposed the ancient Greek drama of Orpheus and Eurydice to Rio's world-famous Carnival. The film, for which director Marcel Camus was awarded the top Palme d'Or prize at the Cannes Film Festival, features music by Antônio Carlos Jobim and Luiz Bonfá, a classic soundscape of samba and bossa nova. Carmen Miranda (1909-1955) was known for her tutti-frutti hat, but it was samba that made her famous. A milliner and the daughter of Portuguese immigrants, she came to prominence with her 1929 hit ""Samba não vá sim'bora"" (""Samba, Please Don't Go""), before heading to Hollywood a decade later. In film and on TV, she was known as the Brazilian Bombshell. Martinho da Vila, a composer, singer and devoted member of the Unidos de Vila Isabel samba school in Rio de Janeiro, is considered one of the leading figures in the samba world. His 1974 song ""Canta Canta, Minha Gente"" (""Sing, Sing My People"") was an international hit. At the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro in August, he performed along with his daughters at the closing ceremony. Every Monday, musicians meet for a round of samba music at the Pedra do Sal, a historical place in the center of Rio de Janeiro. Anyone can join in, and everyone is welcome. Samba is the common cultural denominator that brings the city's inhabitants together, even if they come from different social backgrounds. In this photo, children from Rio's poor district of Cantagalo rehearse at their samba school. The rhythms, lyrics and melodies of the famous samba schools characterize Rio's favela communities. Many children dream of a career in the samba business, making TV shows and traveling abroad. From Brazil to the world: the global triumph of samba hasn't left Germany untouched.

You call it decay, caused by the Western concept of a policy of inevitability — which means, the future is conceived as an extension of the present. Is liberal democracy a thing of the past? I hope liberal democracy is a thing of the past, because if it's not a thing of the past it can't be a thing of the future. For me the big problem and the big challenge of contemporary politics is that we're all living in a permanent now. And if you live in a permanent now, democracy doesn't make any sense, because democracy involves looking at the past to make decisions in the present, which then affect the future. If we want democracy to work, we have to make sure that we have education and media policies that keep people living in a world where time flows forward. Those are basic preconditions for democracy. So I don't think democracy is dead. I think democracy is having a hard time right now. Read more: Opinion: Istanbul and Hong Kong – a double victory for democracy The French historian Emile Chabal proposed we should stop using the term populism, because it means too many different things. Would you agree? The people we call populists have the following things in common: First, they deny climate change. Second, they use digital means more than the other side, and often they're helped by foreign countries who are carrying out digital campaigns on their behalf. And third, they tend to deny factuality, they tend to push into question the idea that there's a real world or that facts matter. Those are the things that they tend to have in common. Timothy Snyder says a blurring of the line between fact and fiction, especially in regard to climate change, has typified the rise of a populism that is testing democracy A lot of the people we now call populists I don't think actually have any relationship to the people that's meaningful. A lot of them represent foreign oligarchical interests, or the interests of American or Russian energy companies, which is not the same thing as representing the interests of the people. Another thing which unites these people is, none of them has any idea about the future. They're all trying to keep us in this permanent now of ""us and them"" where the migrants or the Chinese, or the Mexicans or the Jews, or the gays or whoever are a permanent enemy. They're trying to keep us in a kind of cyclical politics. So personally I don't think populism is the best name for it. And the other problem with populism is that often people say ""populist"" when they just mean somebody who challenges the status quo. Since I personally think the status quo is untenable, I don't want a negative connotation attached to anybody who's challenging the status quo. That said, I mean we do have to take seriously that there are an awful lot of people who are trying to undo the status quo in the sense of undoing the rule of law, and undoing democratic procedures, and perhaps most importantly undoing factuality, and that this is a very serious problem. Read more: Vladimir Putin interview: Liberal idea has 'outlived its purpose' How can we strive for truth in an increasingly complex world? I can think of two answers. The first is ethical. You have to take an ethical position and say that truth is worth striving for. And you have to take an ethical position and say, professions that pursue facts are good professions. The truth is good, and even though we never attain perfect truth, just like we never attain perfect health, pursuing it is a good thing. And professions that pursue it, especially investigative journalists, are doing good. You cannot do without ethics here. Because if you try to do without ethics, immediately you get pushed back into the position of, well, your opinion is one thing, my opinion is another thing and let's just all have our opinions — which is the dominant mode now in Western discourse. And the left by the way bears a certain amount of responsibility for this. Once you're there, then it's very hard to have democracy. Master of 'alternative fact' populism: President Trump is said to have made over 10,000 false or misleading statements during his time in office But if we also have different facts, then we can't have democracy, because facts are the things which allow us to say, 'You care more about clean water. I care more about, let's say, cultural continuity. But we can both agree that the water under the church is polluted.' But if we can't agree about that, if we have different facts, then we can't act together. There can't be civil society, there can't be democracy. The second answer is that there has to be public policy to support the fact creators. Fiction is free, facts have a cost. And the facts are good, like clean water is good, or clean air is good, or access to energy is good. If it's a public good, then you have to make policy that supports that public good, whether that means subsidizing public radio or public television, or creating the equivalent of public internet. Whether it means subsidizing investigative journalism, whether it means messing around with the algorithms so that actual investigative journalism has some kind of advantage, you have to have public policy which brings the facts to the fore. Should we have laws against trolls, hate speech and fake news, especially on the internet? Free speech is based on the principle that you know who's speaking. I think the Austrians have a point when they say that people who represent themselves on the internet should be able to identify themselves (Editor’s note: Austria has proposed banning anonymous online comments to fight hate speech). That's not a violation of free speech, that actually enables free speech, because we can't really have a conversation if you don't know who I am, and I don't know who you are. Or if I'm a bot pretending to be a person, or I'm a Russian pretending to be a German.

So, I think it would be reasonable to have a law which said, bots should be identified as bots, and people should be identified as people. Another thing to think about is competition. We recognize that there's fair and unfair competition. In the profession of journalism, fiction is unfair competition because it's free. It's much easier to just make something up. It is reasonable to legislate about things like that.

People should have the freedom to say, I would like to have the choice — today I would like the stupid internet, but maybe tomorrow I'd like the smarter internet. Those things can actually be regulated. Timothy Snyder is Professor of History at Yale University and a permanent fellow at the Institute for Human Sciences in Vienna. Published in 40 languages, Snyder's work has received the literature award of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the Ralph Waldo Emerson Award and the Hannah Arendt Prize for Political Thought, among other honors. His recent books are Black Earth: The Holocaust as History and Warning (2015); On Tyranny: Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century (2017); and The Road to Unfreedom: Russia, Europe, America (2018). The interview was conducted by Sabine Peschel during the ""Cultural Symposium 2019 in Weimar - Recalculating the Route|"" organized by the Goethe-Institut. The legislative body known as the Bundesrat, or Federal Council, had its primary seat in this building in Bonn until the body moved to Berlin in 2000. Plenary sessions took place in the assembly hall of the adjoining Pedagogical Academy, where laws were drafted, discussed and voted. The Basic Law, the constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany, also has its origins there. This plenary chamber in the former Bundesrat building is where the Parliamentary Council negotiated a provisional constitution for the young Federal Republic of Germany just after WWII. The council consisted of 65 members — 61 men and four women. After lengthy negotiations, the Basic Law was passed in May 1949 by a vote of 53 to 12. The Federal Council also met in this room from 1949 to 2000. A new exhibition called ""The German Basic Law|"" held in the former Bundesrat building, focuses on the historic hall that was central to the process of drafting the Basic Law. The exhibition organized by the Haus der Geschichte, Bonn's German history museum, includes several items from the Bonn Republic, the era from 1949 to 1990 when Germany was divided into East and West. A one-story, simple and bright space designed to represent the values of the new Federal Republic of Germany, the bungalow served as the chancellor's residence starting in 1964. Many historic meetings also took place there, including one in June 1989 with the last leader of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev. A protected monument since 2001, the building now hosts events and concerts. It was the control center of the Bonn Republic: the chancellor's office in the Federal Chancellery. Helmut Schmidt, chancellor from 1974-1982, is seen here leafing through files in 1976. Gerhard Schröder, in office from 1998-2005, was the last to use it has his primary office for a year before moving to Berlin in 1999. Today, the study in the former Federal Chancellery is open to visitors. This palace, completed in 1860, was named after its second owner, Prince of Schaumburg-Lippe. Surrounded by a large park with historic trees, the white neoclassical-style building served from 1949-1976 as the primary seat of the Federal Chancellery; the chancellor's bungalow was also later built on the park grounds. Many treaties were signed there. It's called the ""White House of Bonn|"" since it looks a bit like the one in Washington, DC. The Villa Hammerschmidt is another symbol of the Bonn Republic's young democracy, as it housed the first president of the Federal Republic of Germany and his successors until Berlin's Bellevue Palace took on that role in 1994. Hammerschmidt still serves as a secondary official seat for the president. Politicians regularly answered journalists' questions here in the historic hall of the Federal Press Conference, an association of full-time journalists. Known in German as the Bundespressekonferenz (BPK), it was created in the autumn of 1949. Foreign state representatives also made a stop here; pictured above is a press conference with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko in 1979. The Hotel Petersberg is an impressive building with a special history. It was here that in November 1949, the allied high commissioners and the Federal Republic's first post-war chancellor, Konrad Adenauer, signed the Petersberg Agreement, a treaty that extended the rights of the Federal Republic. The Occupation statute was relaxed, which meant more sovereignty for the young democracy. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the lawn in front of today's university building was a magnificent ornamental garden; it was later used for agriculture. Today it is a space where students can relax, but the Bonn Hofgarten also witnessed turbulent times: In the 1960s, 70s and 80s, several demonstrations took place here — among other things against nuclear armament during the Cold War.

The prize, given to a German-language author ""who has made a significant contribution to contemporary German cultural life|"" is worth €50,000 ($56,000) and is considered the most important literary award in Germany.

""With great stylistic assurance and a wealth of formal variations, his dramas and novels always find new and different ways to explore the fundamental existential condition of modern life|"" the jury statement continued. The stack is high: There are now some 3,500 titles in Reclam's Universal Library (""Universal-Bibliothek"") series of literary classics, including many by famous German writers and artists (above). But let's not kid ourselves: Who honestly managed to read more than 100 during their studies? Each German household probably holds more of these little books than meets the eye. They're so small that they easily disappear behind larger volumes. Along with the yellow booklets in German, there are the orange bilingual volumes, while the red ones are in a foreign language, and the the blue ones offer study guides to accompany the literary works. Scribbled and stained covers can be found on many well-loved, or at least well-used, Reclam volumes. It's more proof that these books didn't just sit on a shelf. Some authors' names might trigger nostalgia or chills, but they all have a home in the Reclam format. Reclam publishes more than just the classics of literature. Speeches, theories and other essays are also included in the series, such as this book of three speeches by contemporary German political activist Jan Philipp Reemtsma. Reclam includes books that every student should read, including ""The Diary of Anne Frank."" Scribble, doodle and scrawl: Whatever helps when a class is really boring. The notes of long ago can make for interesting reads on top of the book — literally. Penguin Classics were first created 80 year ago. Acclaimed graphic designer Willy Fleckhaus definitely drew on the original Reclam model for the covers he designed for German publisher Suhrkamp (above right). If thick, expensive tomes can turn off prospective readers, the Reclam books' low cost added to their enduring popularity. Author: Sabine Peschel (db) Those are qualities that also characterize Bärfuss' essays, in which he fearlessly scrutinizes today's world while offering a curious and appreciative perspective. Among the award-winning writer's best-known works are the novels One Hundred Days (2012), about the genocide in Rwanda; Koala (2014), the harowing story of his brother's suicide; and the stage plays The Sexual Neuroses of Our Parents (2003) and Oil (2009), about the global dependence on fossil fuel that premiered at the Deutsches Theater Berlin. An illustrious legacy The namesake for the Georg Büchner Prize is the dramatist and revolutionary who was born in the German state of Hesse, and whose most famous work, Woyzeck, was still unfinished when he died aged 23 in Zurich in 1837. The first prize in Georg Büchner's honor was awarded in 1923, but has been bestowed by the Academy to an author writing in German every year since 1951. Former winners include German-language literary greats such as Erich Kästner(1957), Günter Grass (1965) and Thomas Bernhard (1979), while more recent recipients include Sibylle Lewitscharoff (2013), Jan Wagner (2017) and, last year, the writer Terézia Mora. sb/als (with dpa) Send Facebook Twitter google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/345rX"|"German's most esteemed literary prize has been awarded to the prodigious Swiss author, playright and essayist, who was praised for examining the ""fundamental existential condition of modern life.""

The selection is limited anyway: bratwurst, currywurst and french fries. And only mustard, ketchup or mayonnaise to go along with it. The classic ""imbiss"" was ubiquitous in Germany for decades, but, just like the classic ""kneipe|"" or corner pub, the snack bars are slowly dying out. They're being replaced by modern, bright eateries with flair that offer a ""burger of the week"" with grilled antipasti vegetables, basil pesto, hazelnut mayo and grilled scamorza cheese. Truffle-Parmesan french fries are served with it. But the journey from sausage to vegetable burger has been an odyssey. Chance brought Sharon Schael from her homeland across Mexico and Spain to the German capital. As a DJ, she came to the right place. But she grew tired of Berlin's relentless nightlife and dreamt of opening a cafe. Settling instead on a food truck, Schael initially nicknamed it ""El Carrito|"" or small car, a name that's stuck until today. When Sharon Schael explains what arepas are, she describes them as bread pockets that can be filled with anything that tastes good, meaning diverse fillings that brim with her own signature flavors. The pockets are baked exclusively from cornmeal and are thus practically gluten-free. Sharon Schael actually focuses on six homemade fillings for her arepas. It's never easy to decide between, for example, the ""Con Todo"" with black beans, beef, avocado and cheese; or the ""La Reina"" with chicken avocado salad. One way or the other, Schael's homemade salsa, a souvenir from her time in Mexico, will be the crowning glory. From medieval carts to 'rubble' stalls The snack is nothing new. Mobile snack stalls came about in the Middle Ages in Germany, with food offered for sale from carts at markets. But on days where the outdoor markets were closed, getting food on the go was by no means the norm. ""Since Germany, like all of Central Europe, was a society of scarcity for centuries, there was only just enough to eat|"" Gunther Hirschfelder, cultural anthropologist at the University of Regensburg, told DW. This resulted in a fixed meal schedule. Food was eaten according to fixed rules, at fixed times and at home. ""It was considered indecent to trot through the countryside and munch on something."" Read more: Berlin 24/7: What's the currywurst cult all about? This rigid system only relaxed in Germany after the Second World War. During reconstruction, a new form of out-of-home consumption was created in the ruins of German cities: the so-called ""rubble stalls."" In Cologne, for example, there was the ""Puszta Hütte"" in the late 1940s, where goulash was served from pots. Eating outside of the home was still generally frowned upon, but the foundation was laid for a change in habits. US soldiers were simultaneously setting a new standard in the country. Not only had they brought along with them their casual manner, their chewing gum and their chocolate, but also their own food culture. Germans were becoming more familiar with eating on the road from the ""diners"" depicted in the US films of the time as well. Send Facebook Twitter google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/1GQMV Mass motorization and the snack boom Another stone for modern German snack culture was laid in the mining towns of the Ruhr area as early as the 19th century. Clean mineral water was offered in so-called ""drinking halls"" because normal drinking water was unpalatable. Later, coffee, tea and magazines were added to the selection. After the war, workers would stop as such places for a cigarette and a beer on their way to or from work. Soon, sandwiches were on offer to go along with it. The actual triumph of the snack bars finally began in the 1960s with the economic upswing. Meat consumption became the norm, and the trend toward french fries was spreading from England and the Netherlands to Germany. The demand for a quick snack too grew dramatically. The mass motorization and new desire to travel that accompanied the postwar ""economic miracle"" in Germany were doing their bit as well. Guest workers from Italy, Greece and Turkey opened their first fast food restaurants and stalls in large German cities and industrial centers. The bratwurst soon faced competition from pizza and gyros, later from the popular döner kebab. In 1971, the first German McDonald's restaurant opened in Munich. Fast food culture was at its peak in the 1970s and 80s, a time when speed of service subsumed flavor, and sustainability. Read more: Record for biggest kebab in the world set in Berlin A classic ""drinking hall"" in western Germany Slow food, health and environmental consciousness At the turn of the millennium, snack culture changed noticeably. Classic greasy and salty fast food was considered unhealthy and got a bad rap. A demand for vegetarian and vegan food grew and the stalls and snack bars adapted, with a lot more falafel or tofu on the menu. Nowadays snacks run the gamut of classic bratwurst at the soccer stadium stall, to vegan Indian food at a music festival, to insect burgers from the food truck. ""In our lifestyle society, one's individual lifestyle is expressed in their nutritional style|"" said Gunther Hirschfelder. In his opinion, the ""permanent snacking"" and eating out trend will continue due to new forms of mobility and the growing number of single households. But he adds that the trend is moving away from exoticism and toward an ""apolitical re-nationalization"" and regionalization of German snack bar culture. Pretzels from the local bakery are cool again, as are french fries, though cooked in clean, saturated fat-free oil. Though food trends are fickle, snacks have found a permanent place in a fast-evolving culinary culture. ikea restaurants made them famous all over the world: Köttbullar, or Swedish meatballs. Sweden has now revealed that the recipe for its iconic dish actually came from Turkey. It was brought to the Scandinavian country by King Charles XII, who lived in exile in the Ottoman Empire in the early 18th-century. Unlike in Turkey, Swedes — and Ikea — often dish up meatballs with gravy and ligonberry jam. The English muffin actually doesn't come from England, though its creator did. Samuel Bath Thomas moved to the United States from England in 1874. It was only after crossing the Atlantic that he created the popular breakfast food that was baked on a griddle rather than in an oven. English muffins were imported for years into the UK from the US before British producers started making their own. Döner Kebab can be found worldwide, and many say the popular grab-and-go meal originated in Germany. Kadir Nurman, a Turkish-born restaurateur who lived in Berlin, is said to have been the first person to take traditional Turkish spit-roasted meat and stuff it into a flatbread. While many contest his 1972 ""invention|"" Nurman definitely helped make the meal a German — and a global — culinary hit. What reputable French bakery would dare to not offer croissants? After all, the buttery, crescent-shaped pastry is practically synonymous with French baked goods. But the croissant actually comes from the Austrian ""kipferl."" This was brought to Paris by an Austrian artillery officer who adapted it into the croissant. And the ""kipferl""? Its origins supposedly lie with the Ottomans. The Spanish word ""faja"" means belt or sash, and ""fajita"" refers to the strips of beef skirt steak used in this dish. While prevalent on menus at Mexican restaurants today, the sizzling meal can actually be traced to West Texas cattle ranchers. The Tex-Mex chimichanga (above), a deep-fried burrito, has a similar story, though it is neither Texas nor Mexican — it was invented in Arizona. Round with a hole in the middle; boiled, then baked: that's the bagel we know today. For many, it's a New York City specialty, or an American one at least. But the bagel actually traces its roots to Jewish communities in Poland. The name ""bagel"" comes from Yiddish, which was influenced by German dialects. Bagels were a mainstay of Polish cuisine before Polish Jews brought them to the US. These crisp, hollow cookies that contain lucky numbers, words of wisdom or prophecies are served after a meal in Chinese restaurants in nearly every country — except for China, that is. They are not a tradition there. The sugary oracle is thought to have been first made by Japanese immigrants in California in the late 19th or early 20th century. A similar cookie is served in parts of Japan. While hummus' ingredients are easy enough to identify (chickpeas, tahini, olive oil, lemon, garlic, salt), its origins are anything but clear. In fact, they can be downright controversial. Tension over the dip's origins even spiraled into a ""Hummus war"" after Lebanese and Israel both laid claim to it. The fact remains that hummus can be found widely across the Middle East and Mediterranean.

Nazi Germany is teetering as Western Allies move in across the Rhine and the Soviet Red Army sweeps into the country from the east, with stories of its war atrocities preceding it. On April 30, Nazi leader Adolf Hitler commits suicide, putting a bullet to his head. Other high-ranking Nazi leaders do the same. But they aren't the only ones to take their own lives. By May 8, the day Nazi Germany unconditionally surrenders, thousands of ordinary German men, women and children had killed themselves in a national wave of suicides. It's a story that German author and documentary historian Florian Huber detailed in his bestselling 2015 German-language book, which was released Thursday in English as Promise Me You'll Shoot Yourself: The Downfall of Ordinary Germans, 1945 by British publisher Allen Lane. The translation, by Imogen Taylor, was also released by Text Publishing in Australia one month ago. The Soviet Red Army captured the German Reichtags building (above) and the capital on May 2, 1945 ""What drove whole families, who in many cases had already withstood years of deprivation, aerial bombing and deaths in battle, to do this?"" Allen Lane's description of the book asks. This is the question that Huber sets out to answer through eyewitness testimony and archival research. Germany's biggest mass suicide The book zooms in on the small northeastern German town of Demmin, where up to 1,000 Germans, out of a population of roughly 15,000, killed themselves — including children whose parents admonished them to do so. Some parents even took the lives of their own children before killing themselves. ""Over years, people had been indoctrinated by German propaganda about what was bound to happen should the [Soviet] enemy set foot on German soil|"" Huber said in a 2015 interview with DW. Rumors of pillaging, rape, and barbaric disfiguration committed by the Red Army terrified the German populace. ""People believed that the only way to escape these horrors was to commit suicide|"" the author added. Drownings, shootings, hangings and ingesting poison were the common means of taking one's life. Read more: Anonymous: 'A Woman in Berlin' US forces fought several fierce battles against the German Wehrmacht in Hürtigen Forest near Aachen. Lasting several months from fall 1944 until early 1945, the battles would also be remembered as some of the longest and most significant fought on German soil. Hürtigen Forest is now part of the ""Liberation Route Europe|"" a remembrance trail along the advance of the Western Allied forces. Surprised it was still standing, US forces captured the railway bridge at Remagen, south of Cologne, on March 7, 1945. Thousands of US soldiers were able to cross the Rhine for the first time in what became known as the ""Miracle of Remagen."" German bombing runs eventually led to the bridge’s collapse 10 days after it was captured. Today there is a peace museum in the remains of the bridge towers. While the US forces generally transported their fallen soldiers back to America, the British soldiers who died found their final resting place in 15 cemeteries in Germany. The biggest of these is the Commonwealth War Cemetery in Reichswald, close to the Dutch border. Amongst the 7,654 dead there are some 4,000 pilots and crews of fighter planes, of whom many were Canadian. In the east, the Soviet Red Army launched the last big offensive on April 16, 1945. The Battle of the Seelow Heights began at dawn with bombardments to aid the push towards Berlin. Some 900,000 Soviet soldiers faced 90,000 Wehrmacht soldiers. The largest World War II battle on German soil - as well as the thousands of dead that resulted from it - are commemorated by the memorial there today. Soviet and US forces meet for the first time on German soil in Torgau on the Elbe River on April 25, 1945. The event effectively closed the gap between Eastern and Western fronts. The war's end moved within reach and the soldiers' handshake in Torgau became an iconic image. The meeting of Allied troops is remembered in the Saxon town every year on Elbe Day. German armed forces signed the unconditional surrender in the night of May 8-9, 1945, in the officers' mess in Berlin-Karlhorst. Today the original Act of Surrender, which was written in English, German and Russian, is the main feature in the museum's surrender room. Another permanent exhibition focuses on the Nazi war of annihilation against the Soviet Union, which began in 1941. The sheer size of the memorial in Treptower Park is impressive. The memorial, including the military cemetery, covers an area of some 100,000 square meters. It was built after the Second World War to commemorate the Red Army soldiers who fell in the Battle of Berlin. A pair of stylized Soviet flags made of red granite serves as the portal to the memorial. After Nazi Germany's surrender, the heads of government from the three main Allied forces met at Cecilienhof Palace in Potsdam in the summer of 1945. Joseph Stalin, Harry S. Truman and Winston Churchill led the delegations at what became known as the Potsdam Conference, called to establish post-war order in Europe. It ultimately decided on the division of Germany into four occupation zones. Berlin was also divided into four sectors. The district Zehlendorf became the American sector. Here the former US Army cinema ""Outpost"" has been turned into part of the Allied Museum. It documents the political history and the military commitments of the Western Allies in Berlin - detailing the occupation of West Berlin in 1945, the airlift to the city and the withdrawal of US troops in 1994. This Prussian Baroque palace was the location of the ""Two Plus Four Agreement"" talks in 1990 among both Germanys and the powers that occupied Germany at the end of the war: the USA, Great Britain, France and the Soviet Union. The four powers renounced all rights they held in Germany, paving the way for German Unification. Several plaques commemorate that this is where World War II finally ended. Author: Frederike Müller (sc) While Demmin is considered to be the largest mass suicide in German history, Huber underlines that the town was not a singular case, and that fear and panic was not limited to the Soviet Army's advance. ""Many people felt a sense of guilt and entanglement. They were afraid of what might come next. Many could not even imagine what the world might be like after these twelve years in a state of emergency|"" he said. ""This sense of being doomed was not limited to the East German population. It prevailed throughout the country … Entire families committed suicide all over Germany."" Taboo under communism While the English publishers have described the book as a ""suppressed"" story and ""one of the last untold stories of the Third Reich|"" the British daily The Guardian pointed out that European historian Christian Goeschel explored the topic in his 2009 book Suicide in Nazi Germany. In Demmin's cemetary stands a monument to those who committed mass suicide at the end of WWII. The topic was taboo and suppressed during the GDR years. But Huber explained in 2015 — when his book was originally published — that the topic was taboo in Germany for so long because, in his estimation, the communist former GDR took a hardline stance against anything casting a bad light on the Soviet Union and its Red Army. Moreover, many of those who were liberated from Nazi rule after the war saw this time as one of relief, and sometimes celebration. ""But what many others saw was quite the opposite|"" Huber said. ""So much so that they believed they had no choice but to kill themselves."" Promise Me You'll Shoot Yourself: The Downfall of Ordinary Germans, 1945 by Florian Huber (translated by Imogen Taylor) is available starting July 4 from Allen Lane publishers. DW often elects either not to report on suicide, or to report only in brief, because there are indiciations that some forms of journalism concerning suicide can prompt others to imitate the acts.

The performance in Eberbach Monastery on July 7 was ""probably the highlight of the orchestra's existence|"" said Peter Guy, the orchestra's founder and director. To him personally, it also meant coming full circle. Pleased with the results: Peter Guy Thirty-five years ago, the double bassist from the US state of Montana found himself seeking a musical career in Germany, in nearby Wiesbaden. From there, he proceeded to South Africa to perform in various orchestras and teach. After Apartheid unraveled in the 1990s, Guy sought ways to give children in impoverished townships access to music education. Bochabela was the name of the elementary school where the musician pursued his initiative in 1997, at first with 18 children. It eventually developed into the Manguang String Programme, in which over 700 schoolchildren currently receive musical instruction. ""Appropriately|"" says Guy, ""Bochabela translates as 'Place where the sun rises.' And our current instructors are role models for the kids. They themselves are products of the system and can speak the three or four languages you need in order to operate in a 100 kilometer radius in the townships."" Imbued in light at the rehearsal and sharing radiance in music making: the Chamber Chorus Vocal Neuberg and the Bochabela String Orchestra In its 22 years of existence, the program has produced individual success stories: After earning his master's degree in South Africa, one musician is now enrolled at the Juilliard School in New York while others perform in various South African orchestras. Partly funded by donations and sponsorships, the program seeks to engage children after school hours; a boarding school, says Guy, ""remains one of my big dreams."" Is classical music a growing enterprise there? ""Definitely|"" said Guy. ""In the whole horrible history of Apartheid, the government told people that if you were white, you could play cricket, but if you were black, soccer. Classical music was for whites, and jazz for blacks. Now more and more young people are choosing classical instruments, and they don't limit them to a particular genre or style."" Performing with courage The non-academic approach to musical instruction was suggested in the musicians' body language during their performance in the Eberbach Monastery. Arms, heads and bodies moved to the musical flow — movements that transferred to the musicians from other countries who'd joined them. And to audience members in the church pews, who during the African songs nodded their heads to the beat. The concert began with a long procession of musicians, singing softly For the political hymn and national anthem ""Nkosi Sikelel' I Afrika"" (Lord, Bless Africa), the audience stood up; and in a series of encores after the Haydn mass, one woman got up and danced to the music. In ""Weeping|"" the song interpolated before the end of the Haydn Mass, the final lines go, ""The threat is under firm control / As long as peace and order reign. / I'll be damned if I can see a reason to explain / Why the fear and the fire and the guns remain."" That message fits the Rheingau Music Festival's motto this year, ""Courage"" — which partly stands for the life and achievements of South Africa's freedom fighter and later president, Nelson Mendela. And it seemed to sum up the feeling in a country where enormous problems remain, yet where agonizingly slow progress gives way to moments of hope. Matched by energetic and enthusiastic music making, it's an upbeat tone needed everywhere.

Published in 2018, the Australian writer who is also one of the world's leading scientists in the field of artificial intelligence, chose the year 2062 because his daughter would have been as old that year as he was when he wrote the book. Walsh makes clear how AI will change our lives, our work, but also have effects on politics and society in general. He also sets out to answer important questions: Will robots develop consciousness? Will we end up becoming machines ourselves? And how will we wage wars in the future? The author and researcher was recently in Germany to speak at ""Recalculating the Route|"" a cultural symposium themed around the future held at the Goethe Institute in Weimar in June. DW talked further with Walsh about his visions for the future. Read more: Artificial intelligence: The EU's 7 steps for trusty AI DW: People have long been scared of machines. Is there a growing justification for this fear in 2019? Toby Walsh: There's a deep psychological fear in our psyche that goes back millennia, one in which people think that machines might actually take over. Actually, I think the things we should be fearful of are actually not the intelligent machines, but the stupidity of machines. And that we'll be giving responsibility to machines that don't have the appropriate intelligence. Certainly machines have no consciousness, no sentience, no desires of their own. Machines do only what we tell them to do; they're not going to suddenly wake up and decide to take over the planet. The problem with machines is is that they do exactly what we tell them to do. And sometimes we haven't thought carefully through what we're telling them to do. Send Facebook Twitter google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/3JnTl Part of the intention of my book is to prompt people not to be so worried about these sorts of Terminator scenarios in which machines rise up and take over the world. However, they should realize that it's actually much more insidious that we are already handing over decisions to machines that might be biased, might be racist or sexist, and all these sorts of things that we've been trying to get out of a society for the last hundred years. How might AI actually serve to improve our future? To live in the world in a more sustainable way, we have to embrace technology. If we think of all the challenges facing the world, the only hope we have to deal with all these stresses is what we've done for the last hundred years, which is to embrace technology. Read more: Can AI create real art? People forget that since the Industrial Revolution, in a wealthy country like Germany, life expectancy has nearly doubled — because of the fact that we have used technologies. We have used science to live healthier lives, to understand disease and to invent things like penicillin that have allowed us to live much longer. Politics have completely failed us, so our only hope now is to deal with things like climate change by looking for technical fixes. Toby Walsh says artificial intelligence can bring great benefits, but also pitfalls Do you think AI will become our new God? I think the risk is that we won't be gods ourselves. There'll be an underclass of people who are unemployed and unemployable because the machines are doing all the work and the wealth is owned by a very few small number of individuals who are the owners of the robots. So, we'll be far from God. We'll be living a very low-quality life. At the end of the day, technology is to be used for us. And it will hopefully amplify our humanity. After all, it's all those very human things — our empathy, our social intelligence, our emotional intelligence, our creativity — that machines don't have today. Read more: Resistance to killer robots growing And it's not clear if they ever will have those things. We are ultimately going to appreciate things that are touched or made by the human hand. We pay much more for handcrafted breads and homemade beer — and all those things that only humans make — than for the mass-produced things the machines make. A woman looks at a work of art created by an algorithm in 2018. It was produced by a French collective ""Obvious|"" which produces art using artificial intelligence. What should we do now to better control the way we utilize machines in the future? People need to be better educated about the risks. We need regulation; we need governments. We're discovering that we have to properly regulate the tech sector, just like we regulated big oil and big pharma and big tobacco. All of those companies had to be regulated so that they worked for the public good. Europe is leading the way. The General Data Protection Regulation is a beginning, an example of how to get appropriate privacy, and to get the tech companies behaving with our data more appropriately. And the interesting thing is, my friends and colleagues working in the tech sector will tell you in private they need to be regulated.

It was his fourth book, the 1995 novel The Reader, that catapulted the German state constitutional court judge to international literary fame. The story of a love affair between a young high school student and an older woman who turns out to to be an illiterate former concentration camp guard, it became a bestseller in Germany soon after publication. Global bestseller The Reader has been translated into at least 50 languages and, a first for a German novel, made it to the top of The New York Times bestseller list. The novel has become standard reading material in German schools and book clubs, and in 2008 was adapted by Hollywood into an Oscar-winning film starring Kate Winslet and Ralph Fiennes — its five nominations included best film, with Winslet winning best actress. Few books by German authors have enjoyed such international success. But it didn't come without controversy. The film adaptation was heavily criticized by the likes of Explaining Hitler author Ron Rosenbaum who, writing in Slate, said it asked ""us to empathize with an unrepentant mass murderer and intimates that 'ordinary Germans' were ignorant of the extermination until after the war."" Send Facebook Twitter google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/346QZ Before hitting on the top-seller, Schlink had already published a trilogy — also successful — about a German private eye by the name of Gerhard Selb (Selb is German for ""self""). Despite his literary prowess and accomplishments, however, Schlink's main profession was not novelist but law professor and judge. He might have also become a priest. Born on July 6, 1944 in the German city of Bielefeld, the youngest of four children, Schlink was the son of a German theology professor and a Swiss mother and moved to Heidelberg at a young age after his father became a pastor. In interviews, he has recalled the nightly family ritual of reading the bible out loud after dinner. Legal career Schlink studied law in Heidelberg and Berlin, where he graduated from the Free University in 1968. He taught constitutional and administration law in Bonn and was a judge at the North Rhine-Westphalia constitutional court from 1987 to 2006. Co-author of a tome on constitutional law that is a standard read for law students in Germany, he moved on to teach at Frankfurt's Wolfgang Goethe University in 1991, and to Humboldt University in Berlin a year later. A scene from film adaptation of ""The Reader"" that was not without controversy The young professor had a law degree and a doctorate but was restless and felt something was missing, he told the Frankfurter Rundschau in an interview in 2013. He signed up for a goldsmith workshop to try his hand at making jewelry and enrolled at the California Massage Institute — only to realize that neither were what he was looking for. 'Perceptive narrator' Eventually Schlink found his second calling — ""I always enjoyed writing as a student, and in a way, I returned to it"" — and launched what was to become a successful writing career with the Selb books in 1987. Thirty-one years and many books and essays later, he published Olga, his most recent novel, in 2018. Time and again, Schlink explores Germany's historical legacies, from the Nazi era to the far left Red Army Faction terrorist group of the 1970s that is the focus of 2008's, The Weekend. ""Bernhard Schlink is one of the biggest talents in contemporary German literature|"" commentator Michael Kluger once wrote in the Frankfurter Neue Presse daily.

The curators of ""Very British — A German Point of View"" dove deep into the British-German relationship to find the objects that have brought the two nations together over the past six decades. They even managed to find the famous tiger skin from the British New Year's Eve sketch ""Dinner for One"" in a private collection. In Great Britain the mention of this strange TV piece draws blank faces, but in Germany it has a cult following. Presented in eight unique sections, the exhibition begins with the German dismay at the Brexit vote, which is reflected in Jacques Tilly’s ""Brexit gun"" design for a Carnival parade float in Düsseldorf in 2018. A model-sized version of the Jacques Tilly float caricaturing Theresa May's suicidal Brexit policy. The exhibition especially focuses on how the Germans saw their English neighbors and their cultural quirks — particularly up until German reunification in 1990. The headline ""Spinnen die Briten?"" (Are the British crazy?) on the front page of an old newspaper could also be from today in the context of Brexit. Passing the football Britain's imminent exit from the EU also had exhibition organizers in Bonn wondering if the show would go ahead. There were concerns that the shipments of the exhibition pieces might have problems reaching Germany. A hard Brexit could have been a death knell for the exhibition project that was conceived in 2016. This led the director of the National Football Museum in Manchester, Tim Desmond, to transport the precious leather football used in the legendary 1966 World Cup final between Germany and England in his own private luggage. The day before the opening of the exhibition, he himself placed it in the display cabinet at the Haus der Geschichte. After the 1966 World Cup final — won by England 4:2 — German player Helmut Haller took the precious ball with him and secretly brought it to Germany as a souvenir, a move that was not exactly beneficial to the German-British friendship. It wasn't until 1996 that England's Football Association officially received the trophy back from Germany. Britain is only allowing the football from the 1966 World Cup final to be kept in Germany for two weeks Precious exhibits: King George I's crown Other valuable exhibits were lent to Germany with special permission from Queen Elizabeth II. An entire exhibition room is dedicated to the Royal Family. In the center sits the royal crown of George I, who came from the northern German city of Hanover. His reign represents the German roots of the British royal family. The valuable headdress is one of the crown jewels and is kept in the Tower of London. It is not allowed to leave the country without the Queen's permission. The admiration for the British monarchy is unbroken in Germany, as the exhibition in Bonn shows. Conveying how Germany's interest in the royal family has evolved over time, the exhibition especially focuses on the new generation of royals, including kitschy souvenirs such as plates and key rings featuring portraits of Prince William and Kate Middleton, as well as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. Read more: 5 things you probably never would have guessed were presents to Queen Elizabeth II Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, Prince Philip, started their visit in Berlin on Tuesday evening, with the British monarch welcomed by a 21-gun salute and military jets flying overhead. Fans of British royalty took to the streets of Berlin to try and catch a glimpse of the queen on her way to the Hotel Adlon. Here the royal Bentley passes the famous Brandenburg Gate. After arriving to Berlin on Tuesday evening, the queen's entourage probably didn't have a difficult time finding their rooms overlooking the Brandenburg Gate. The Hotel Adlon flew the royal standard the queen's suite. Berlin police said it would deploy close to 1,500 officers to keep the queen safe, during her first visit to Germany in a decade. Wednesday's first meeting saw Queen Elizabeth be received by German head of state Joachim Gauck in the president's residence, Bellevue Castle. After meeting President Gauck, the queen and her husband took a cruise down Berlin's Spree River in an open-topped boat. Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, Prince Philip, have been married since 1947, six years before the queen's coronation. The Duke of Edinburgh turned 94 in June. German Chancellor Angela Merkel welcomed the queen on at the Chancellery. Merkel also had a meeting scheduled with British Prime Minister David Cameron. The queen laid a wreath at Neue Wache, the Berlin's memorial site for the victims of war and violence. On Thursday, the Queen and her husband will visit the former Nazi concentration camp Bergen-Belsen, which was liberated by British troops in April 1945. Post-war reconciliation The exhibition explores how German-British relations were given a new political foundation after the end of World War Two. During a speech in Zurich in 1946, then-British Prime Minister Winston Churchill spoke for the first time of the ""Iron Curtain"" dividing the Soviet-controlled Eastern Bloc from the rest of Europe. In 1956, Churchill was awarded the Charlemagne Prize in Germany for his political foresight. The 1948-49 Berlin Airlift that wrote another chapter in British-German history is a central part of the broad history presented in ""Very British."" During the Cold War, the Soviets blocked the Western Allies' railway, road, and canal access to the parts of Berlin under Western control. In addition to the Americans, the so-called ""raisin bombers"" of the British Royal Air Force flew in food and essential supplies for the starving Berlin population. This helped to force Stalin to lift the blockade in May, 1949. In 1956 then-British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was awarded the Charlemagne Prize for his political foresight Berlin spy stories told by Brits The heavily bombed city of Berlin that sat on the frontline of the Cold War became a playground for espionage services from all over the world. British writers such as John le Carré and later Timothy Garton Ash who spent time with Germany were targeted by the Stasi and KGB, the German Democratic Republic and Soviet secret services. Spy novels became bestsellers in post-war Germany and many were turned into successful films, as the exhibition's extensive display of book and film artifacts show. Every Friday, BBC Radio would read out letters from critical GDR citizens that were smuggled out of East Germany using secret mailboxes — a largely unknown chapter that the exhibition sheds light on. The British soldier broadcaster BFN thrilled young people in Germany with its popular culture and music programs. DJ and presenter Chris Howland, known as ""Mr. Pumpernickel|"" became a star in West Germany. Read more: You say you want a revolution? - The decade of the rebels Bands like the Beatles and the Rolling Stones became Britain's greatest musical exports in the 1960s and fans in Germany worshiped them like gods. Pop culture from the ""Swinging Sixties"" cultural revolution in London dramatically changed the German cultural landscape. British music — from Elton John to Sting, from Ed Sheeran to Adele — continues to shape the German-British cultural exchange to this day, and the exhibits at the Haus der Geschichte in Bonn help to tell this evolving cross-cultural story. ""Very British — A German Point of View"" runs July 10, 2019 to March 8, 2020 at the Haus der Geschichte in Bonn. A fashion buff in the 1960s, Mary Quant got her first taste of the fashion design life by trimming her grandmother's knee-length skirts. Then she took on the boutique, Bazaar, in London's Chelsea neighborhood, where sold her own tailor-made skirts. These were much shorter than the modest skirts her mother and grandmother had worn — ending at least ten centimeters above the knee. Outrageous! ""I liked my skirts short because I wanted to run and catch the bus for work|"" Quant once said. The young designer sold not only hip designs in her boutique, she changed the image of the young, modern woman forever with her mini-skirts. But she didn't stop at mini-skirts — always inventing new looks and trying out new materials, like PVC: ""Fashion is a very ongoing, renewing thing|"" she said. The mini skirt became a symbol of London's ""Swinging Sixties."" Twiggy, the young model with the thin legs, androgynous figure and pixie haircut, wore the short skirts on the catwalks of the world. Members of The Beatles also frequented Quant's boutique to find dresses for their girlfriends; the store was, at that time, on King's Road: the epi-center of ""Swinging London."" Mary Quant never wanted to be the sole recipient of the fame her mini-skirt creation flamed. ""The King's Road girls invented the mini-skirt. I had already made the skirts short, but the customers always wanted them shorter|"" she once said. Yet the style was christened mini, after Quant's preference for the car of the same name. When the first young ladies stepped out in public wearing the short skirts, they were issued warnings by stern-faced police officers. Some even had to make sure that such a skirt length was allowed at all. The Vatican condemned the style as lewd, but Queen Elizabeth, seen here in 1965 on her visit to Germany, awarded Mary Quant a medal for her services to the fashion industry the following year. The daring idea caught on among designers and the media took a fancy to it. In 1962, ""Vogue"" showed Quant's designs. By 1964, the mini-skirt had arrived in Germany; a year later, the trend had established itself worldwide. Yet it was not until the end of the 60s that such short skirts also appeared in the collections of renowned French fashion houses such as Yves Saint Laurent and Christian Dior. The trend didn't end, even as Mary Quant discontinued her fashion line in 1969 to concentrate on a line of accessories, cosmetics and lingerie. She attributed her getting into the make-up business to an interest in designing ""a complete look, from head to toe."" Although the designer herself retired in 2000, the eponymous label is still around. Her contributions are on display in London's V&A.

It is virtually impossible not to enter into dialogue with one's own shadow, with partially hidden reflections or perhaps with a breathing wall of moss. Eliasson seems to effortlessly create what many artists strive very hard for in their works. Yet his often playful installations are also imbued with a great deal of conviction. ""Although there are objects that can be exhibited in a gallery and that may also be collected, it's actually about the encounter itself|"" the Danish-Icelandic artist told DW in Berlin in 2010. The Tate Modern in London is now giving visitors the chance to engage in these encounters in a special Eliasson show that draws from 30 years of artistry. Read more: Architect Daniel Libeskind comments on climate change through sculptures Art and nature When a young Eliasson relocated to Berlin in 1994 after studying art in Copenhagen, he quickly decided to jettison his theoretical training and go in search of his own true calling as an artist. He partly did this though hiking tours in his native Iceland. ""I perceived every stone, every smell, every bit of water, every type of light and every hole in the ground, but it was different every single day|"" he said in an interview with Der Spiegel magazine in 2000. He had hit upon a theme: The interrelationship between humans and nature. This artistic awakening is prevalent throughout the Eliasson works that make up the ""In Real Life"" show in London. Moss Wall 1994, for example, is a 20 meter (66 foot) long wall made of Finnish reindeer moss. Eliasson's vast moss wall serves to amplify the majesty of nature You can smell this huge living organism before you even enter the room. Are you permitted to touch it? Absolutely. Eliasson has faith in museum goers to be responsible and have awareness about their interaction with the work. This is the way to discover art; not through written explanations on panels. An Eliasson art show is about subjective perception, about experiencing art with all one's senses. Read more: Art connecting the Amazon rainforest and Greenland's glaciers Among the essential elements that are ever-present in these works, water is a recurring motif. Beauty 1993, for example, is a simple yet powerful water installation that evokes a rainbow via spotlights. Meanwhile, Big Bang Fountain 2014, which was created some 20 years later, is a fountain in a darkened room that only becomes visible when a brief pulse of light hits the water at its highest point. Eliasson designed an 11 meter high waterfall with the help of scaffolding for this version of the installation. Big Bang Fountain, 2014 Different perspectives Viewers are not only forced to contemplate the wonders of nature in the climate crisis age, but take a good, hard look at themselves. Your Spiral View from 2002 features a huge, walk-in kaleidoscope of mirrors that helps to twist one's self-perception. A borderline experience can also be had in the installation Dein Blinder Passagier 2010 (""Stowaway"" 2010), a 39 meter fog corridor (see top image) in which visitors can only see their feet and have to feel their way along the walls. The show seems timeless. Without text panels, it is difficult to determine the years in which the works were created. They are just as relevant today as they were 30 years ago, Eliasson told the German Press Agency a day before the opening. Yet today's visitors would ""view them with a different perspective|"" he added. That is why he does not want the exhibition to be considered a retrospective. ""I hope to work for another 30 years|"" said the 52-year-old. The Tate Modern is a special place for the Scandinavian artist. For the gigantic turbine hall of the former Tate power plant, he created a glowing illusory sun under a mirrored ceiling in the 2003 work, Weather Project. This was a milestone in contemporary art that was visited by two million people, giving his career a massive boost. It is fitting then that ""In Real Life"" ends with Little Sun, a small solar lamp he created in 2012 that provides light for five hours and is intended for use by the many family households in sub-Saharan Africa that are not connected to the power grid. Read more: Eliasson: Europe needs a unified position on refugees Inspired by his legendary ""sun"" that showed at the Tate in 2003, Eliasson and engineer Frederik Ottesen started the ""Little Sun"" project in 2012 that aimed to bring sustainable solar lamps to people who need them most. Low emission art Based in Berlin since the early 1990s, Eliasson runs a studio in a former factory building in Prenzlauer Berg in which around 100 employees implement his designs. They, too, are part of the exhibition: Every two weeks, some of them are brought virtually from Berlin to London for conversation via a live broadcast. To contribute to the good vibe at the Eliasson art studio, the artist treats himself and his crew to their very own canteen. For Eliasson, it's a place where all employees can meet in a relaxed atmosphere — and eat excellent organic food. Otherwise inaccessible to outsiders, visitors can get a taste of Eliasson cuisine during the solo show. At the Terrace Bar of the Tate Modern, his chefs will offer regional vegetarian food just like in his Berlin studio. Eliasson's commitment to protecting the environment is also evident in the exhibition. For example, in 2018, he had chunks of Greenland's glacier ice brought to the entrance of the Tate Modern so that the Londoners could directly experience the melting caused by climate change. Photos of this, as well as the glaciers in Iceland taken by the artist, can be seen in the current show. ""Faces of climate change:"" Olafur Eliasson first put people face to face with melting ice outside the landmark 2015 Paris Climate Conference The London museum itself is also climate-conscious: All the works in the solo exhibition were brought to London by land or sea. In an interview with German public broadcaster ARD, Eliasson said that visitors to the show need to make a similar effort. ""Sometimes it's also a bit of hard work going to a museum. It's not like going to a supermarket|"" he said. ""We are here to question ourselves, to examine ourselves, to see ourselves in the context of the world."" Olaf Eliasson: In Real Life runs July 11, 2019 through January 5, 2020 at London's Tate Modern. Every year the Tate Modern in London attracts five million visitors. The new extension, known as the Switch House, costs upwards of 260 million pounds (329 million euros, $368 million) and is set to help the museum house not only scores of guests, but also a greater variety of artwork. The new Switch House is a modern, pyramid-shaped extension to the main museum building, which was constructed out of a disused power station. It increases the Tate Modern's exhibition space by 60 percent. Just like the original Tate Modern, the Switch House was designed by the Swiss Architects of Herzog & de Meuron. The concrete, wood and brick construction was supervised by German architect Ascan Mergenthaler, who is a partner at Herzog & de Meuron. Some 336,000 bricks were used for the Tate Modern extension. For the new building, the architects did away with rigid walls, envisioning a unique texture with a perforated pattern of tiles. Seven double-decker buses could fit on top of each other in the Turbine Hall of the Tate Modern. The massive space is currently home to the seven-meter-high (23-foot) tree sculpture by the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei. Visitors at the Tate Modern will get closer to the exhibits than ever before - by participating in some of them themselves. Performance art is planned for in the new building, inviting guests to be part of interactive installations. This year, Frances Morris became the first woman to join the Tate Modern's panel of directors.

"a-49568780"|"https://www.dw.com/en/rediscovering-a-jewish-cultural-legacy-at-the-weimar-republic-of-yiddishland/a-49568780"|"Stuart Braun"|"For 20 years, Yiddish Summer Weimar (YSW) has served to restore the vibrancy of Yiddish culture, and especially music, that was once a key part of European cultural life. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Berlin developed into the capital of a kind of unofficial Yiddish cultural republic that stretched from Russia to France. This network of Yiddish-speaking cabarets, theaters, literature circles, educational institutions and even workers' organizations often seamlessly assimilated into broader culture and society. The Holocaust tried, but failed, to put an end to that. Yiddishland is roaring back to life in the city most often associated with icons of German Romanticism. 1000 years of culture ""The Weimar Republic of Yiddishland|"" the 2019 theme for YSW that runs July 12 through August 17, celebrates a Yiddish creative heyday as secular Jewish culture peaked in Germany and Europe before Hitler rose to power. ""Jewish artists were prominent in all fields of Weimar era culture, including literature, classical and popular music, theater, film, cabaret, fine arts and even modern dance|"" YSW festival director Alan Bern told DW. Born in Prague in 1894, Erwin Schulhoff was a protege of Antonin Dvorak. ""He saw in Schulhoff the next big promise of the European musical scene|"" said Amit Weiner, who founded the project ""Music in Times of Tragedy."" His music combined many avant-garde styles with jazz."" Schulhoff was a professor of music in Prague before he was murdered in 1942 in a concentration camp. The youngest Jewish composer murdered during the Holocaust, Gideon Klein was only 26 when he perished in the Fürstengrube sub-camp near Auschwitz. His oeuvre fuses Jewish themes with modern composition techniques. In 1940, he was offered a scholarship at the Royal Academy of Music in London. ""This could have saved his life, but he was not allowed to travel from Prague|"" explained Weiner. ""I find it very interesting that Krasa's music is always so happy and optimistic. Even the music he wrote in Theresienstadt is very lively|"" said Weiner about the Czech composer and author of the children's opera ""Brundibar|"" who died in 1944 in Auschwitz. ""Even in such dark times and horrible conditions, he saw hope and was optimistic about the future."" The Czech poet had published several books of fairy tales in German before being transported to Theresienstadt in 1942. Weber started writing songs when she worked in the camp's children's hospital, and her music survived only thanks to her husband Willi, who discovered her songs after the war. Ilse and their son, Tommy, were murdered in Auschwitz in 1944. ""He was not a professional musician — in fact, he was a carpenter who did not even know how to read notes. All the songs he composed were written down by his friend, a clockmaker|"" said Weiner about Gebertig, who, despite being just an avid amateur, remains one of the most popular singer-songwriters in Israel. The Polish composer died in the Cracow ghetto in 1942. Prior to his deportation to Theresienstadt, Pavel Haas had written film scores and orchestrations but also destroyed much of his work. ""He was very depressed at first, but composers such as Klein or Krasa encouraged him to keep on writing|"" said Weiner. Paradoxically, the work he created in Theresienstadt surpassed what he had done before the war. He was murdered in Auschwitz in 1944. ""If he hadn't been imprisoned and later murdered in Auschwitz in 1944, I am sure he would have become one of the most important musical forces of the 20th century|"" said Weiner about the Austrian Jewish composer who had been appointed conductor of the Prague State Opera before the war. The three years he spent in Theresienestadt were paradoxically the most prolific years of his career. Author: Jan Tomes So too in architecture and philosophy. Names like Walter Gropius, founder of the Bauhaus school in Weimar that turned 100 this year, and thinkers Hannah Arendt — a student of Yiddish — and Theodor Adorno of Frankfurt School fame are examples of the impact that German Jews had on global culture. The numerous Yiddish-language literature and music publishers located in Berlin during the Weimar Republic — including the Yiddish-language chapter of the international P.E.N. writer's association known as ""Yiddishland"" — were the outgrowth of 1000 years of Yiddish language in Germany. ""In fact, the Jewish presence in Weimar-era culture was so strong that it notoriously led to a reaction by the Nazis|"" notes Bern, a composer, accordionist and cultural activist from the US who has been based in Berlin since 1987. The Nazis railed against Jewish cultural cosmopolitanism and ""made it a major point of their nationalistic, anti-Semitic propaganda|"" he added. After coming to power in 1933, Hitler soon enacted policies that ""excluded Jews from broader German cultural life."" But to highlight the fact that Jewish and Yiddish culture survived, and is indeed undergoing a significant global revival, YSW's Weimar Republic of Yiddishland event will premiere ten new international music and theater productions that go far beyond performances by traditional klezmer bands. Alan Bern's mission to revive Yiddish culture is bearing fruit A cabaret revolution These include the world premiere of the orchestral version of Bas-Sheve, the sole surviving European Yiddish opera. Composed by Henech Kon, the work premiered in a chamber version in Warsaw in 1924 and will be performed nearly a century later by the ""Triangle Orchestra"" consisting of thirty young musicians from across Europe. They accompany a libretto based on the biblical tale of King David and Bathsheba, with the performance coming to the Weimar Republic of Yiddishland on August 16. Another attraction is the ""Café Cosmopole|"" a musical theater pastiche with original music by the Yiddish songwriting duo ""Tsvey Brider"" — Yiddish for ""Two Brothers."" Together, Anthony Mordechai Tzvi Russell on vocals and Dmitri Gaskin on accordion, piano and synthesizers create music set to the words of Yiddish poets and writers who embodied the between-the-wars café scenes of Berlin, Odessa, and Warsaw, where Jewish communists, socialists, zionists, emigrés and bohemians held sway. Sasha Lurje Sasha Lurje, a regular performer at YSW, co-founded the annual ""Shtetl Neukoelln"" festival in Berlin that showcases the capital's thriving klezmer community while celebrating ""the vibrancy and diversity of contemporary Yiddish music, language, culture, art, and life."" This year, the singer participates in several Yiddish music workshops at YSW and performs in the premiere of Baym Kabaret Yitesh, a reprise of the iconoclastic Warsaw Yiddish cabarets of the 1920s. New York Times bestselling author and Yiddish expert Michael Wex is behind the revival of the revolutionary and avant-garde ""expressionist experiments"" that marked Yiddish cabaret in Poland and spread Europe-wide. On July 30 in Weimar, attendees can again experience music, song, stand-up routines, monologues and sketches performed by an international cast. Yiddish Summer Weimar is regarded as the world's most prominent annual Yiddish culture event Rising above the past This Jewish cultural revival is ironically going on not far from the Buchenwald concentration camp built by the Nazis in 1937. 11,000 Jews were among more than 56,000 prisoners murdered there. ""That we are located only a few miles from Buchenwald reminds us every day of the importance of our mission|"" says Alan Bern. ""The systematic murder of millions of Yiddish-speaking Jews in the Shoah meant that the living cultural base from which contemporary Yiddish culture grew was gone|"" he adds, noting also that millennia-old Yiddish culture was also rejected by the State of Israel founded on a ""new cultural identity for Jews."" A part of what was lost will be revived at the YSW by Yiddish rapper Josh Dolgin in Arestantnlider: Hearing Unheard Voices. Dolgin's work was inspired by ethnographic recordings of Eastern European Jewish prisoners in German POW camps during World War Two. Bern believes that with the contribution made by Yiddish-speaking Jewish artists to broader cultural and artistic life, such a cultural revival is even more important. YSW, he says, is ultimately dedicated to ensuring that this rich creative tradition can again be ""a source of inspiration and ideas for all contemporary artists, Jewish or not."" Yiddish Summer Weimar runs July 12 through August 17 in venues throughout Weimar. In 1919, Walter Gropius became the director of a new institution, the Staatliches Bauhaus, also simply known as the Bauhaus, which merged the former Grand Ducal School of Arts and Crafts and the Weimar Academy of Fine Art. Even though Gropius was an architect and the term Bauhaus literally translates as ""construction house|"" the school of design did not have an architecture department until 1927. In a pamphlet for an April 1919 exhibition, Gropius stated that his goal was ""to create a new guild of craftsmen, without the class distinctions which raise an arrogant barrier between craftsman and artist."" Combining influences from modernism, the English Arts and Crafts movement, and Constructivism, Gropius promoted the idea that design was to serve the community. The most basic principle of the movement of the Bauhaus school was ""form follows function."" According to this idea, simple but elegant geometric shapes were designed based on the intended function or purpose of a building or an object. Illustrating this concept, the pieces of this chess game designed by Josef Hartwig (1923-24) are stylized to suggest how each of them moves and its rank of power. The interdisciplinary approach of the school's professors and students meant that visual arts, graphic design, architecture as well as product and furniture design all came into conversation with how people lived in the modern world. They thereby actualized the concept of the ""Gesamtkunstwerk|"" or complete work of art. This photo shows the interior of the Bauhaus school in Dessau. The school had many major artists among its teachers. This photo from 1926 features, from left to right, Josef Albers, Hinnerk Scheper, Georg Muche, Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, Herbert Bayer, Joost Schmidt, Walter Gropius, Marcel Breuer, Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, Lyonel Feininger, Gunta Stölzl and Oskar Schlemmer. Hannes Meyer and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe were also directors of the school. Although the Bauhaus is associated with minimalist design, students and teachers invested an unsuspected amount of energy in creating surreal costumes for parties, as reported by Farkas Molnar in his 1925 essay, ""Life at the Bauhaus."" The parties began as improvised events but were later turned into large-scale productions, such as Oskar Schlemmer's ""Triadic Ballet"" from 1922 (photo). Political tensions led to different closures of the school. After being based in Weimar from 1919 to 1925, the Bauhaus moved to Dessau (picture). When the Nazis gained control of the city council there, the school closed again in 1932 and was reopened in Berlin. It was closed permanently in April 1933, pressured by the Nazi regime, which criticized the institution for producing ""degenerate art."" Even though the Bauhaus school was closed, different members of its staff kept spreading its idealistic concepts after they fled Germany. For example, many Jewish architects of the Bauhaus school contributed to the White City of Tel Aviv (picture), where a collection of 4,000 buildings were designed in the Bauhaus style. It is a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage site. Though today people might most commonly associate modern, affordable, modular furniture with Ikea, the concept wasn't born in Sweden, but rather inspired by the classic works of Bauhaus designers. This photo shows tubular furniture designed by Marcel Breuer and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe from 1927 to 1930. The Bauhaus school turns 100 in 2019. Germany's major celebratory program involves not only the three museums housed in the former schools in Weimar, Dessau and Berlin (picture), but also at least 10 of the country's 16 federal states will participate. Expect several exhibitions, events, publications — and even new museums.

This can be really refreshing in summer. In the old town, visitors will find numerous fountains that remind them that the bubbling cool water is really drinking water. In addition, the numerous canals in the old town are fed cold water from the river Lech and provide a pleasant climate. Outside the Augsburg Town Hall, itself a magnificent Renaissance palace, visitors also get an idea of the Bavarian city's special appeal. The Augustus Fountain from the 16th century on the Rathausplatz (Town Hall Square) points to a past history as a Roman settlement under Emperor Augustus. Directly below the figure of the emperor, the monumental fountain depicts four water deities representing the rivers Lech, Wertach, Brunnenbach and Singold, which all shaped Augsburg. The 16th century Augustus Fountain in Rathausplatz Water as a source of life and wealth The abundance of water is a major reason for the early economic boom of the city. Augsburg's citizens quickly understood how to make use of water. This applied to the craftsmen who used water mills to generate energy, as much as to the drinking water supply and food processing. Visitors can, for example, discover these facts on the ""Around the Old Town"" tour which follows the trail of water through nine stages. The tour also leads to the former town butchery, only a few steps away from the town hall. The central slaughterhouse, completed in 1609, was designed by Elias Holl, a famous Augsburg master builder, to have an open channel under the building to cool the meat and dispose of any waste. Waterworks at the Red Gate Waterworks at the Red Gate - one of three water towers was used solely to supply water for the magnificent fountains on Maximilianstrasse Augsburg has a long history revolving around water. Above all, the city still has many buildings that testify to this culture that evolved over centuries. A central component of this heritage is the waterworks at the Red Gate, a 15th century building complex with a viaduct, three water towers and two houses for fountain masters. For almost 500 years, the complex was used to supply Augsburg with drinking water. The entrance to the waterworks is adorned with two dolphins spouting water. ""Nobody needs these dolphins. But people in Augsburg have always exalted the subject of water through art|"" says Martin Kluger, one of the initiators of Augsburg's application to have its waterworks added to the UNESCO World Heritage list. ""This waterworks ensemble is probably unique in Europe. The special thing is that the architecture is completely preserved."" Augsburgers also liked to decorate functional buildings — water-spouting dolphin at the entrance to the waterworks The Romans built the city center on a hill for fear of flooding, so the drinking water had to overcome a difference in altitude. In the waterworks at the Red Gate, the flow velocity of the Lech was used to bring drinking water from the Brunnenbach into the towers by means of scoops. From there, pipes led the water down to the city's public wells. From the 16th century onwards, rich Augsburgers could even have a private connection made for their own courtyard well. ""But until the 19th century, only a few could afford that, it was really a luxury|"" says Martin Kluger. A water connection like this was three times as expensive as a house in a simple district of Augsburg. Water management as a UNESCO World Heritage Site Back then, Augsburg's water supply technology was regarded as exemplary throughout Europe and was an early attraction for travelers. In 1580, the French philosopher and politician Michel de Montaigne remarked in his travel diary that Augsburg was ""richly blessed with public fountains"". Mercury Fountain — one of three magnificent fountains on Augsburg's Maximilianstrasse On Saturday Augsburg has been listed another UNESCO World Heritage Site for its diverse and preserved architectural evidence of a more than 500-year-old history of water management. ""This is about the whole complex, there is a story here — half a millennium in which each technological step can be traced|"" says Kluger. Moreover, access to fresh drinking water remains a vital issue for people all over the world. Row, row, row your boat A final example of how you can enjoy water in Augsburg leads to the outer city moat. As a former part of the medieval city fortifications, it actually no longer serves a purpose. But as a lake it is a natural idyll where mallard ducks, carp and beavers feel at home. Idyll at the former city wall, the Augsburg Kahnfahrt boat hire In summer, after work or on weekends, you can see people rowing across the water. Rowboats have been available for hire at the Augsburg Kahnfahrt since 1876. Bela Balogh, who is the fourth generation to run the family business, emphasizes that relationships are also developed during a boat trip like this. His great-grandfather took his wife rowing for their wedding. And Bertolt Brecht, the Augsburg-born poet and playwright, was also known to have taken his first love across the town moat in a rowing boat."|"In the Middle Ages bankers like Jakob Fugger made Augsburg an important city.

The 82-year-old farmer from the northeastern state of Pennsylvania knows that a decades-old family tradition is coming to an end. He once bred cattle here, but he's retired now and knows his children are unlikely to follow in his footsteps. Like many in Berk County, Sunday is the descendant of German immigrants who came from the Palatinate region of southwest Germany in the 18th century to find a new home. They were farmers who worked hard, believed in God, and cultivated their German culture. While the farmer himself has never been to Germany, his parents spoke Pennsilfaanisch Deitsch (""Pennsylvania Dutch""), a German dialect spoken by the rural population for 300 years that is still alive today. ""Ich kann's ned gud schwätze, aber ich verstehe"" (""I can't speak it well, but I can understand it""), said Sunday in the local dialect. Read more: Why 'Little Germany' disappeared from NYC and other little-known events of German-US history Bratwurst on sale at a yearly festival in the Pennsylvanian town of Kutztown that celebrates its strong German heritage German dialect born in the USA Patrick Donmoyer of the University of Pennsylvania wants to preserve this German heritage for future generations. At the German Cultural Heritage Center in Kutztown in Berks County, he teaches Pennsylvania Deitsch in a former German school from 1870 that is now a museum. On an old school slate board in the cultural center, one can see ""deitsche Sprichwadde"" (German adages) written down such as ""Schpaar die Geld"" (""saving money""), and the unusual phrase ""gut gwetzt ist halwer gmeht"" (""well-sharpened is half mown""), which literally refers to the mowing of fields with a scyth. The language is not at risk of extinction, says Donmoyer. Around 40,000 people speak the dialect in Pennsylvania alone, and around 400,000 across America. The number is rising since many Amish and Mennonites faith communities who speak Pennsylvania German as their mother tongue traditionally have large families. Some 30% of Pennsylvanians have German ancestors, and many of the descendants still speak some form of German at home. Donmoyer says a Pennsylvanian German dialect has developed into its own language across 300 years. Her real name is Diane Heidkrüger and she was born in Germany in 1976. The film ""Troy"" with Orlando Bloom made her famous in 2004. She became a US citizen in 2013. Other influential Germans in the US film industry today include ""Troy"" director Wolfgang Petersen, and Roland Emmerich, who shot ""Independence Day|"" the ultimate in patriotic blockbusters. It was also thanks to the former Prussian officer Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben that the militarily inexperienced Colonist army was able to defeat the world power Great Britain in the Revolutionary War. With discipline, drill and order he made a powerful troop out of the guerrillas. He described his training methods in a book which became a standard military work. The painting ""Washington Crossing the Delaware"" is located at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. It depicts a decisive moment in the American Revolutionary War (1775-1783), when the Colonists under General Washington, who had so far been unsuccessful, launched a counterattack on the British. It was painted by Emanuel Leutze (1816-1868), who emigrated to the US from Germany as a child. His descendants founded the world-famous Waldorf Astoria Hotel, but this was still unfathomable to the butcher's son Johann Jakob Astor from Walldorf near Heidelberg when he moved to the US in 1784. He became America's first multimillionaire through fur trading and real estate sales — and was the inspiration for literary legends Ebenezer Scrooge and Scrooge McDuck. With her husband Fritz, Mathilde Franziska Anneke fled Westphalia to Milwaukee, Wisconsin after the democratic revolution in the German states failed in 1848. She worked as a journalist, published a women's magazine and fought for women's suffrage and equal educational opportunities — and thus became one of the leading US feminists. Löb Strauss, a young Jew from Buttenheim near Bamberg, emigrated to the USA in 1847 at the age of 18 with his mother and sisters. The Gold Rush drew him west, where he wanted to sell tent tarpaulins to gold prospectors — and saw that they needed robust trousers. Thus were ""jeans"" born — making Levi Strauss, as he was then called, and his business partner, Jacob Davis, rich. Born in 1867 as the son of a Jewish cattle dealer in Laupheim, Germany, Karl Lämmle emigrated to the US at the age of 17. For 20 years he survived by doing odd jobs. In 1906 he visited a small movie theater — and it sparked an idea. He opened his own cinema, started a successful film distribution company and founded Universal Studios in 1915 — one of Hollywood's first big dream factories. The 1930 movie ""The Blue Angel"" made Marlene Dietrich a world star, catapulting her to Hollywood with director Wilhelm von Sternburg, where she ended up staying. When the Nazis seized power in Germany in 1933, she supported Jews who had fled and other exiled Germans. She also sang ""Lili Marleen"" to cheer up US troops — probably the most famous song of the Second World War. Arrested and expatriated by the Nazis, Hannah Arendt fled to New York in 1941. The 35-year-old journalist and philosopher quickly learned English and became an American citizen in 1951. As a writer, she reported on the Eichmann trial and coined the much-discussed term ""banality of evil."" One of her goals in life was to explain how the Holocaust could occur. Engineer Wernher von Braun constructed the V-2 rocket, which was built by forced laborers for the Nazis. After World War II, Americans had him come to the US. He was among over 1,000 German scientists who were never held accountable for their work for the Nazi regime. As the father of rocket technology, Wernher von Braun became a space travel idol in the US when NASA astronauts landed on the moon. Born in Fürth, Franconia in 1923 as Heinz Alfred Kissinger, he emigrated to New York in 1938. During the Second World War he returned to Germany as a soldier — then as an American. After studying and teaching at Harvard, he advised politicians. The highlight of his career: Under President Nixon, the Nobel Peace Prize winner was US Secretary of State from 1973 to 1977. Author: Susanne Spröer (als) 'Barn stars' from the old country Another German cultural import that is still typical across Pennsylvania and beyond is the famous ""barn star"" or ""hex sign"" seen fixed to farmhouses and barns. Ranging from decorative five-pointed stars to colorfully painted twelve-point compasses, the signature emblems were brought across the Atlantic by the Palatinate immigrants and have developed into a distinct regional art form. At the Kutztown Folk Festival, Donmoyer demonstrates how to paint the barn stars. Contrasting colors like yellow and black give the impression that the stars are turning, he says. The emblems should not be mixed up with pagan symbols, he adds, noting that the sun, moon and stars have always played an important role for people on the land. These Pennsylvania Germans simply continued to draw what was important to them. Decorative ""barn stars"" in Pennsylvania have 300-year-old German origins Old customs reborn The popular Kutztown Folk Festival attracts 130,000 annual visitors who come to experience the lifestyles of German immigrants who have shaped Berks County to this day. In the Wursthaus, one can get their fill of German-style Pennsylvanian sausages with sauerkraut, while a brass band plays music that would not be out of place in the southern German state of Bavaria. The band's trumpet player, Leon Moll, regularly spoke Pennsylvania Deitsch with his parents as a child. Since their death, however, he rarely speaks the language, while his children ""tun es nid mehr schwätze"" (""don't speak it anymore""), he explains. For many, it is only during the nine days of the annual festival that their old country customs come to life.

When director Jan-Ole Gerster presented his graduate film starring Tom Shilling (Generation War, Brecht) at the Munich Film Festival seven years ago, nobody suspected what was to come, least of all Gerster. International arthouse hit It was like a fairy tale, Gerster told DW, adding that Oh Boy (also released internationally as a A Coffee in Berlin) was a low-budget film school production that struggled to find a distributor. ""It would never have seen the light of the screen but would have been broadcast on TV sometime after midnight|"" the director said, still amazed at how the film so suddenly took off. When a distributor finally snapped up Oh Boy, the film toured festivals worldwide, collected dozens of prizes and was shown in movie theaters in about 40 countries, including the US, Canada, Japan, Russia and Australia. The crowning glory was the European Film Award for the Best Debut. ""I'm very grateful that I once had this great experience and I don't think that it can be repeated with every film|"" Gerster cautioned as his sophomore film ""Lara"" finally made it to the big screen. Hard act to follow: Tom Schilling in the low-budget hit, ""Oh Boy"" Feeling the pressure Lara celebrated its world premiere at the festival in Karlovy Vary in the Czech Republic, followed two days later by its German premiere at the Munich Film Festival. The audience's and critics' expectations were high. ""Saying I hadn't felt the pressure after my debut film would have been a lie|"" Gerster said. ""Of course, there are expectations — your own and other people's."" Read more: 37th Munich Film Festival: The power of reality Oh Boy is an impressionistic film set across a single day in which Tom Schilling plays a melancholic young college drop-out and drifter who wanders bohemian Berlin. Lara too is set over the course of a day, but is a complex drama that has little resemblance to Gerster's breakout black and white film with strong French New Wave influences. Set on the 60th birthday of Lara (Corinna Harfouch, Downfall), the film's opening scene sees the title character standing by the open window of her apartment. She climbs onto a chair and seems about to jump — but then, the doorbell rings. Lara opens the door and the story takes a different turn. That same evening, Lara's son, a talented young pianist (Tom Schilling), is about to give his first big solo concert, where he plans to perform his own composition. Lara decides to visit the concert, buys all the remaining tickets and gives them to friends and acquaintances. ""Go for it, Baby"" (Zur Sache Schätzchen) was one of the most successful comedies of the New German Cinema era, with German actors Uschi Glas and Werner Enke starring in May Spil's humorous 1960s movie. The charming and amorous couple represented the social conflicts found in Munich at the time. ""Go for it, Baby"" was as popular as it was revolutionary, and is filled with a lot of Munich charm. Herbert Achterbusch without Munich — that is virtually unimaginable. Hardly any other German director is so closely linked with the city as he is. And what do outsiders think of when they think of Munich? Oktoberfest, of course! Achternbusch filmed his movie ""Bierkampf"" at the beer festival in 1977. He also starred in it, donning a police uniform and relishing in this rather absurd character. With ""Fear Eats the Soul"" (Angst essen Seele auf), legendary Munich-based director Rainer Werner Fassbinder shot one of his most beautiful and emotional films in his hometown in 1973. Focused on an unlikely romance between a 50-something Emma (Brigitte Mira) and her much young lover Ali (El Hedi Ben Salem), the film explores the underbelly of the Bavarian capital — and its discrimination. Whereas Fassbinder focuses on the seedy side of Munich, film director Helmut Dietl prefers exploring the city's famous glamorous exterior. In his 1997 film ""Rossini|"" a famous pub turns out to be the protagonist in the film, shining in all its evening glory. In addition to Spain, the great Orson Welles shot part of his Cold War thriller ""Mr. Arkadin"" in Munich. Welles (right) plays the title role, a mysterious billionaire who hires an American smuggler played by Robert Arden to uncover his forgotten past. Partly shot in December 1954 at Jacobsplatz in Munich, the film — which is actually also set in Berlin — had numerous European locations. A few months after Welles' filming, German-French director Max Ophüls shot his last film, the historical romance ""Lola Montez|"" in the Bavarian metropolis. Centered around the celebrated dancer and courtesan Lola Montez, also mistress to King Ludwig I of Bavaria, locations included Munich's English Garten and Circus Krone's tent. Lola was played by celebrated French actress Martine Carol. French director Alain Resnais shot his 1961 masterpiece, not in the Czech city of Marienbad referenced in the title, but in Munich. The director and his cinematographer, Sacha Vierny, captured beautiful images of the castles and parks at Nymphenburg and Schleißheim. ""Last Year in Marienbad|"" one of the most aesthetically impressive films in cinema history, turns out to a Munich film in disguise. One of the most beautiful Munich films can neither be classified as a feature film nor as a documentary. Shot in 2000 by director Dominik Graf and critic Michael Althen, ""München — Geheimnisse einer Stadt"" (Munich — Secrets of a City) is a poetically playful film essay with both documentary and staged sequences. If you want to get to the heart of this city, this film reveals a few of its secrets. Director Edgar Reitz explored the Munich of the 1960s in the second series in his groundbreaking ""Heimat"" trilogy exploring German history and culture. Reitz showcased the Bavarian city via an enchanting mixture of nostalgia and avant-garde, of delight and melancholy. Rarely has one seen a Munich so open, likeable and friendly than in Reitz' ""Second Home"" (Die Zweite Heimat). Author: Jochen Kürten (ad) Art, dreams and failed expectations It soon becomes evident that Lara has always been envious of her son's efforts to embark on a professional music career, it turning out that she herself once had similar aspirations. Lara is henceforth revealed to be highly resentful and insecure about her humdrum office job career — to the point of being suicidal. Gerster was intrigued by the script that was written by Slovenian author and director, Blaz Kutin, who is also a friend. ""I read it, and in a strange, peculiar way I was enthusiastic, fascinated and touched by this woman's story."" The protagonist stands for ""a conflict and a fear that are not alien to me|"" the director says. ""As a film student ... I remember thinking if I fail now it will be a bad experience forever."" Such empathy for the fact that Lara ""has to realize she made the wrong decision|"" amounted to ""a great tragedy"" that Gerster wanted to explore more deeply. ""As is often the case with people who act like that, there is usually great pain and disappointment at the bottom."" Time will tell where Gerster's career is headed after Lara. His second film has already been invited to other festivals and worldwide distribution is in the works. The director just may be in for yet another surprising cinematic success. What makes a real man? This is the question ""The Art of Self-Defense"" ironically asks at the beginning of the Munich Film Festival. Hollywood star Jesse Eisenberg (right) is trying to increase his testosterone level at a karate club. But will it work? Director Riley Stearns provides some surprising answers. The festival opens its program this year with a generous dose of black humor. With the cinema landscape facing hurdles such as US blockbusters, Netflix and the death of cinemas and theaters, film festivals present the treasures of cinema, somewhat like an exhibition at a museum. A film like ""Bacurau|"" which was awarded the Jury Prize in Cannes, celebrates its German premiere in Munich. Whether the film will then make the leap into movie theaters is uncertain. A good festival always provides viewers with a glimpse into new developments. As a consequence of globalization, more and more co-productions are clearly emerging worldwide — so the Munich Festival added a new category in 2019: ""CineCoPro."" Shown this year is the documentary ""Gaza|"" a German-Irish-Canadian-British production. In the ""CineVision"" category, organizers look at new talents from all over. What questions are asked by the next generation of directors? Often the questions focus on the role of family, tradition and loss of control. One example is ""Angelo"" by Austrian film maker Markus Schleinzer, who uses an authentic story to help trace the fate of a young slave in Europe at the beginning of the 18th century. Second only to the Berlinale, the Munich Film Festival is an important showcase of German film. In the ""New German Cinema"" section this year, ""Golden Twenties"" with German actress Henriette Confurius will face the competition. Director and script writer Sophie Kluge created a sensitive film about a young woman searching for her place in life. In recent years, the sharp boundaries between cinema, television and the offerings of streaming providers have blurred. The Munich Film Festival has long been presenting quality television and situating it in the ""Netflix"" age. The category ""Neues Deutsches Fernsehen"" (New German Television) presents the film ""Play:"" director Philip Koch shows a young woman retreating into the virtual world. Festivals nowadays have special sections devoted to series. Marking this year's Bauhaus anniversary, the festival presents the premiere of the six-part series ""'A New Era."" Set in 1963, the episodes revolve around the 80-year-old Walter Gropius, who faces accusations by a young journalist of having oppressed women. The film stars Anna Maria Mühe (shown here), August Diehl and Trine Dyrholm. Every festival likes to present celebrities and will often have honorary awards for the respective star's life's work. In 2019, the Munich Film Festival will be handing out two ""CineMerit"" awards. One goes to Spanish actor Antonio Banderas. The festival will be showing his new film, Pedro Almodovar's ""Pain and Glory"" as well as an old Banderas classic, ""The Mask of Zorro."" The second honorary award goes to British actor Ralph Fiennes. In this case, it is not all about his merits as an actor, but also about the premiere of the third film directed by Fiennes, ""Nurejev - The White Crow."" It focuses on an episode from the life of Soviet ballet star Rudolf Nurejev (portrayed in the film by Oleg Ivenko) during the Cold War. The festival's 2019 retrospective is dedicated to South Korean director Bong Joon Ho. South Korean cinema is currently on an upswing, and several directors have gained international fame. In May, Bong Joon Ho won the ""Palme D'Or"" in Cannes for his new film ""Parasite."""|"Following his hit Berlin-set debut ""Oh Boy|"" director Jan-Ole Gerster presents his new film ""Lara|"" an unsettling portrait of a desperate woman, at the Munich Film Festival.

Some decisive episodes of common history have been nearly forgotten. Here are a few. 1904 — The end of a community: The tragic journey of the General Slocum Whether it's Little Italy or Chinatown, the roots of the inhabitants of these lively New York neighborhoods are still evident today. Those areas actually used to be a hub of German life, with German street signs, beer gardens and pubs, yet virtually nothing can be seen of that today, other than perhaps the trendy Loreley pub and restaurant. Back at the beginning of the 20th century, however, ""Little Germany"" was the name given to the district on the Lower East Side that was home to around 50,000 people, most of them with German roots. The General Slocum sank in 1904 New York's East River, with over 1,000 people (mainly women and children) dying in the incident The more than 1,300 passengers who boarded the paddle wheel steamer General Slocum on June 15, 1904 were also from Little Germany. That was a Wednesday, a working day, so it was mainly women and children of the Protestant congregation who sailed off on the East River, heading to Long Island for a picnic. But the cheerful trip turned into a tragedy. The ship caught fire, and panic broke out. The lifeboats could not be detached; the life jackets were worthless. When the General Slocum finally ran aground, it was in flames. By then, countless corpses were floating around in the river, with 1,021 people ultimately dying in the event. To this day, it is the biggest civilian shipwreck in the history of the US. Nearly every inhabitant of Little Germany lost relatives in the catastrophe. Most of the families ended up leaving the city district as it reminded them too much of the disaster. By 1910, only a few German families had remained. Lower East Side in New York: ""Little Germany"" became Chinatown Italians and Chinese took over the streets. Little Germany had disappeared — like so many German vestiges in the US. But a look back to history can help us rediscover them... 1683 — Escape to the West: The 'Original 13' wanted freedom of religion For over two months, the three-masted Concord had sailed across the stormy Atlantic before arriving at the port of Philadelphia on October 6, 1683. On board were 13 German families, Mennonites from near Krefeld. They came to the ""New World"" attracted by the proposal of colony founder William Penn. The English Quaker had made land available to religious refugees for colonization. Quaker William Penn founded Pennsylvania as a colony for religious refugees After all, in the German principalities and kingdoms of the 17th century, only the Catholic, Lutheran and Reformed Churches were permitted. Other religious communities were persecuted. In Penn's colony, the ""Original 13|"" as the German families were called, ended up founding ""Deitschesteddel"": the first German settlement in the US. A hundred years later, 200,000 people were living in Pennsylvania, a third of them with German roots. Their antiquated-sounding ""Pennsylvania Dutch"" — a reference to the term Deutsch, or the dialect they used, Deitsch — is still spoken in some communities today, such as among the Amish. The Amish in Pennsylvania still speak ""Pennsylvania Dutch"" today The former ""Deitschesteddel"" is now called ""Germantown"" and is part of Philadelphia. The influence of Germans was also marked in other parts of the Midwest, such as in the states of Ohio, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin: Most of the Americans with German ancestry live in this region, and many major breweries were founded by Germans. Commemorating the arrival of the first German settler group back in 1683, German-American Day is now celebrated every year on October 6. Independence and the Civil War: German military organized American troops It was due to a Prussian that the American colonialists were able to win the Revolutionary War (1775 - 1783) against the British colonial power: Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben was his name. Born in 1730, the offspring of a soldier family had served under Prussian King Frederick the Great before meeting Benjamin Franklin in Paris. Franklin recommended Steuben to the commanding general of the overseas colonialists, George Washington. In 1778, Steuben arrived at the winter camp of the Continental Army. His task: to form an army out of the irregular forces, who consisted of farmers, merchants and politicians, that could stand up to the British professional soldiers. With typical Prussian discipline and drill, Steuben organized the training of the soldiers so thoroughly that they defeated the British. German soldiers also fought alongside George Washington in the Revolutionary War Since 1957, the annual Steuben Parade in New York has commemorated one of the most important German-Americans of the founding period. Members of the German military also fought in the American Civil War (1861-1865). Among them was Franz Sigel, originally from the Heidelberg region. The German lieutenant made it to the rank of major general and was one of the highest-ranking commanders of the North's army. The then popular civil war song ""I Goes to Fight Mit Sigel|"" with its German-English smattering of lyrics, recalls him and the around half a million German soldiers or those of German descent who took part on both sides of the war between the North and South. 1848 Women's rights activist Mathilde Franziska Anneke and the 'Forty-Eighters' Franz Sigel had also been one of those in Europe who had rebelled against the princes and kings in 1848. After the failure of the revolution, he fled to the US. Fritz Anneke from Westphalia (who later fought for the Northern states during the Civil War) and his wife Mathilde Franziska Anneke did the same. Mathilde Franziska Anneke was one of the leading women's right activists in the US She had already been working as a journalist in Europe, among others, for a newspaper for which poet Heinrich Heine had also written. In the US, she was then allowed to do what had been forbidden in the German states: She gave lectures on educational opportunities, gender equality and spoke out against slavery. In 1852, she founded the German-language Frauen-Zeitung (Women's Newspaper). In 1869, she became the first vice-president of the National Woman Suffrage Association — and thus one of the most important activists of the American women's movement. Other ""Forty-Eighters|"" as the people who emigrated from Europe after participating in the 1848 revolutions became known, also pursued careers in the US: Revolutionary Friedrich Hecker got involved with the newly founded Republican Party and Carl Schurz became interior minister and adviser to US President Abraham Lincoln. But all in all, the former German revolutionaries numbered few among the emigrants. Most of those who emigrated fled from hunger and poverty to the West. And the numbers grew: By the middle of the 19th century, one million Germans had arrived in the US. Only towards the end of the century did the numbers decline. 1917 — Sauerkraut becomes 'liberty cabbage' World War I began in 1914. When the US entered the war in 1917, the relationship to German-Americans in the US also changed. German-Americans Americanized their names, while authorities called for a boycott of German goods. German terms disappeared from linguistic usage. Even the popular ""Sauerkraut"" was renamed into ""liberty cabbage."" In the state of Illinois, a mob ambushed German-American Robert Prager, forcing him to hoist the American flag and sing the national anthem. He was ultimately hanged. Funny name for German Sauerkraut: ""liberty cabbage|"" shown here with juniper berries and parsley Even between the world wars, much of what was typically German had disappeared from everyday American life. And the people who fled to the US after the National Socialists seized power in Germany in 1933 wanted nothing more to do with the country that persecuted Jews and other unpopular minorities and murdered millions of people. Many quickly became Americans — like Henry Kissinger, the later US Secretary of State, who fled Germany with his Jewish family in 1938 as a teenager. He assumed American citizenship in 1943 and fought as a GI against his country of birth. US President Richard Nixon (l) with Henry Kissinger in 1973 Unlike the Italians or Chinese who immigrated later, the traces of Germans are markedly more hidden — and yet so closely interwoven with American culture that the two can hardly be separated. Interestingly, the US even owes its title to a German: Cartographer Martin Waldseemüller. Waldseemüller gave the newly discovered country in the West a name on his world map of 1507: ""America|"" after navigator Amerigo Vespucci. He, however, was not German, but Italian."|"Some 45 million Americans have German roots, but not much can be seen beyond the Brauhaus and Oktoberfest. Why? For German-American Day, we tracked down what led Germans to land in the US — and how they left their mark."|"04.07.2019"|"Culture"
"a-49554212"|"https://www.dw.com/en/james-simon-gallery-opens-on-berlins-museum-island/a-49554212"|"Sabine Peschel (dg)"|"Since Ieoh Ming Pei's glass pyramid for the Louvre in Paris, no entrance building for a museum has attracted as much attention as the new James Simon Gallery in Berlin. When the building flanking Berlin's central culture hub was officially opened on Friday in the presence of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the vexed issue of creating a fitting gateway to the world-famous Museum Island finally had an impressive architectural fix. The Berlin office of David Chipperfield Architects took their time to create the best solution: The James Simon Gallery is the product of a 20-year planning process and decade-long construction phase. Serving as a visitor center, and in the future providing direct access to the Pergamon and the Neues Museum, the James Simon Gallery is situated on the fringe of Museum Island on the River Spree. From the gallery, an underground Archaeological Promenade will at some point lead to four of Museum Island's five museum buildings. Gateway to Museum Island It was ""exciting and difficult to understand what it was|"" legendary architect David Chipperfield told DW of his office's attempts to conceive the complex project. It wasn't simply another museum, but ""a collection of different concerns and requirements the Museum Island needs|"" he said. In the end, the gallery is ""an orientation and an assembly place for larger visitor groups|"" he added, as well as a ""connector"" that directly links visitors to the island's museums. The James Simon Gallery also contains a changing exhibition space, and an auditorium designed to present lectures and films. The building is also a bridge to the city, Chipperfield said. A cafe with a large terrace is to stay open at night after the museum closes. In Berlin's historic center, which is rich in cultural buildings, the view from the terrace alone could make the gallery a new favorite among Berliners. Stairs lead to the large auditorium where visitor groups will gather Role models The new gateway to Museum Island, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, was built on the narrow strip of land where an entrance building by famed local architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel stood until 1938. The latter was typical of the classicist architectural language that still shapes the appearance of Museum Island, and which Chipperfield and his chief designer Alexander Schwarz have drawn upon, and inevitably updated. ""The gallery's tall, extremely slender columns show respect for their historical role models|"" said Hermann Parzinger, Director of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation. At the opening ceremony of the gallery on Friday, Chancellor Merkel agreed that it well-complemented the existing historic buildings on Museum Island, which she described as a ""universal museum of human history."" She added that this gateway to five museums would facilitate access to exhibits from different cultures that prove ""we are far more united than separated."" Read more: Berlin's Treasure Trove Chipperfield is not an advocate of the ""form follows function"" school, and it shows in the approach to the two-decade project. ""The purpose of the building is presumably to complete Museum Island as a public space|"" said Alexander Schwarz, director of the David Chipperfield Berlin office. ""Developing architecture from this — not directly from function, but from the place, from the sanctuary for art and science, was certainly a process that was not easy|"" he added, referring to the long consultation process with the museum representatives, and the need to preserve historical monuments — also central to Chipperfield's transformation of the ruins of the Neues Museum into an elegant, modern museum. Alexander Schwarz, David Chipperfield and Hermann Patzinger Honoring James Simon The gallery is named after Jewish philanthropist and patron James Simon, without whose foundations the Berlin museums would not be what they are. The iconic Nefertiti bust and the Babylonian Ishtar Gate are just two of the treasures the passionate art collector donated to the Berlin collections in the early 1900s. Ten thousand objects were donated by the man born in 1851 into a wealthy textile dynasty, and are housed in ten museums. Having died in 1932, Simon's memory was soon expunged by the Nazis. Nearly 90 years later, his significant contribution to Berlin's cultural heritage is finally being honored. A video installation honors the gallery's namesake ""The fact that the James Simon Gallery is named after him is a tribute to him and the Jewish bourgeoisie in Berlin|"" said Michael Eissenhauer, director general of the National Museums in Berlin. Chancellor Merkel said that Simon's important contributions to culture and society had been ""forgotten for too long."" 'Historic moment' The new building is a kind of business card for Museum Island that beckons visitors to ""find their way to the various museums|"" said Hermann Parzinger. The opening is ""an historic moment because it will be the only building added to the historic ensemble of Museum Island"" that is not yet completed, he added. Parzinger said the gallery was ultimately a ""modern keystone"" that gives closure to the island's turbulent 180 year history. The Museum of Modern Literature in Marbach opened in June 2006. Chipperfield fluently interwove elegant motifs of classical architecture with contemporary formal language. The museum plays with perspectives and vistas, contrasting daylight and artificial light. It offers an optimal space for the exhibition of sensitive paper exhibits. In 2003, reconstruction and renovation work began on the Neues Museum in Berlin according to Chipperfield's plans. Together with the architect Julian Harrap, the British architect developed the concept of ""supplementary restoration|"" in which the original substance was preserved. The museum, which was severely damaged during the Second World War, was closed for decades before it reopened in 2009. In 2010, the Folkwang Museum in Essen opened the new David Chipperfield wing. It comprises six pavilions that complement the original museum building, which stands under historical preservation. With its huge pale green front made of recycled glass, the cubic structure radiates tranquillity. The new Turner Contemporary Gallery opened in 2011 in Margate on the Kent coast in southeastern England. The art gallery has played a key role in the city's revitalization. The once pulsating seaside resort was coming to terms with a sharp drop in visitor numbers and falling investment. The building aims to attract new visitors and makes a lasting impact on the cityscape. Redesigned in 2012 as part of an inner-city development project, the old harbor quarters in Wakefield, England, was supplemented with a new museum building for the Hepworth Museum, as conceived by David Chipperfield. Surrounded by water on two sides, the building nested on the banks of the Calder River consists of 10 trapezoidal concrete hexahedra of different sizes. ""Veles e Vents"" — sail and wind — is the name of the building in the port of the Spanish city of Valencia. Erected in 2006 on the occasion of what is probably the most important sailing race in the world, the ""America's Cup|"" the building is designed to resemble a sailboat. What's extraordinary is that the terraces were designed so as to ensure there is a clear view of the sea from every point. The Museo delle Culture ""MUDEC"" in Milan has been uniting the Archaeological Museum, a marionette workshop, a film school and a center for non-European cultures since the beginning of 2015. The renovation of the building, which formerly was a place for industrial workers, includes a glazed inner courtyard, around which the exhibition rooms open up. The Museo Jumex in Mexico City has been home to over 2000 exhibits by international, Mexican and Latin American artists since 2014. Founded in 2001, Eugenio Lopez's private collection focuses on contemporary art. The museum building is based on 14 supports, which merges the surrounding public plaza with the ground floor.

Both triumphed over their Spanish opponents in the semifinals at London's All England Club on Friday. Djokovic, who won his fourth Wimbledon championship last year, dispatched Roberto Bautista Agut in four sets on Centre Court to reach his sixth final. Later in the day, Federer, who has won a record eight Wimbledon titles, defeated longtime rival Rafael Nadal in a similar fashion. Djokovic got the better of Federer in their previous two Wimbledon finals in 2014 and 2015, both of which were five-set thrillers. ""[Djokovic] is the defending champion and he has shown why this week|"" Federer said after his match with Nadal on Friday. Roger Federer (right) serves during his match against Rafael Nadal in the Wimbledon semifinals Federer-Nadal Wimbledon rivalry resumes Federer and Nadal squared off at Centre Court on Friday, their first Wimbledon match since Nadal beat Federer in an exhilarating five-set final in 2008. The 37-year-old Swiss, who beat Nadal in the 2006 and 2007 Wimbledon finals, took the first set of their semifinal, overturning Spaniard's 3-2 lead in the tiebreaker by winning five straight points. But Nadal charged back in the second set, breaking the Swiss twice in a row and serving it out at love. Federer then took control of the match in the third set, finally breaking Nadal to take a 3-1 lead before before taking the third set 6-3. He broke serve again to take a 2-1 lead in the fourth set and held serve the rest of the way to seal the victory. With the 7-6 (3), 1-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory, Federer extended his own all-time record with his 12th Wimbledon final appearance. Only broken once Though Bautista Agut put up a good fight in his first Grand Slam semifinal, Djokovic held off the 23rd seeded Spaniard 6-2, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2. The 32-year-old Serb was broken once in the second set, which allowed Bautista Agut to even the score at one set apiece. The match also featured a remarkable 45-shot rally in the seventh game of the third set, which Djokovic won to hold serve and stay a break up. ""I had to dig deep|"" Djokovic said afterwards. ""It's the semifinals and Roberto was not overwhelmed."" The defending champion then took the third set before cruising in the fourth, though he needed five match points in the final game to clinch the victory. The win put Djokovic in his 25th career Grand Slam final — he has won 15 of his previous 24. He holds a 4-1 record in Wimbledon final, with his only loss coming against Scotland's Andy Murray in 2013. Wimbledon is the world's oldest tennis tournament and is held annually at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet club in Wimbledon, London. In 2009, its Centre Court was fitted with a retractable roof to lessen the loss of playing time due to rain. There are 18 courts used for the Championships (and 22 practice courts) and it takes 15 months and nine tonnes of grass seed to prepare the courts. In modern sports, where advertising dominates team kits and color is everywhere, there is something brilliant about the fact that the kits of Wimbledon players must be 90 percent white. White does not include cream or off-white, just white. Originally, it was to avoid sweat showing. Andre Agassi's wild taste was tamed in the 90s, while Roger Federer's orange-soled shoes weren't part of the code. It might look like good fun being a ball boy/girl at Wimbledon, but training for those in charge of the balls and the towels is perhaps tougher than any other tournament. The 14 to 18-year-old school children train for five months and from 700 applicants, only 250 end up on the coveted grass. The average age is 15 and most spend two years as a ball boy/girl. Apart from the green of the grass and the white of the kit, the other color often seen at Wimbledon is red. Strawberries and cream are the tournament's favorite dish. During the tournament, 28,000 kilograms of strawberries and 10,000 liters of fresh cream are eaten. Add to that the 320,000 glasses of Pimm's, 29,000 bottles of champagne and 25,000 scones then it's no surprise Wimbledon is awesome. One thing about grass that other tournaments can't offer is more remarkable shots. A 17-year-old Boris Becker made it famous when he won hearts and the Wimbledon trophy in 1985, but his famous dive carried on even after he stopped played. In 2011, Novak Djokovic and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga had an incredible rally of diving shots, while Dustin Brown did the same against Lleyton Hewitt in 2013. Both the men's and women's trophies are some of the finest in sport. The Rosewater Dish, the trophy for the women's single champion, has a mythological theme and has the Roman goddess of wisdom and strategic warfare (Minerva) etched around the rim. The champions receive a three-quarter size replica with all the previous champions engraved, as well as the $2.8 million both winners receive. dv/msh (AP, Reuters) DW sends out a daily selection of hard news and quality feature journalism.

Les Elephants looked sharp early and saw a Max Gradel effort tipped onto the post by Rais M'Bolhi. Yet it was Algeria who broke the deadlock, profiting from some questionable defending with Sofiane Feghouli sweeping home Ramy Bensebaini's cross. Boasting a narrow lead at the break, Algeria were gifted a golden opportunity to double their advantage soon after the restart. After being brought down by goalkeeper Sylvain Gbohouo in the box though, Baghdad Bounedjah could only hit the bar with his resulting penalty. Galvanized by the miss, the Ivory Coast went in search of an equalizer which came courtesy of Jonathan Kodija who found the bottom-left corner with the first goal Algeria had conceded at AFCON 2019. Premier League aces Riyad Mahrez and Wilfried Zaha both spurned chances to win the game in normal time, and in the end it took extra time and penalties to decide a pulsating quarterfinal. After Wilfried Bony saw his spot kick saved, the Ivory Coast were handed a lifeline when Algeria's Youcef Belaili struck the post. However, when Serey Die followed suit with the final penalty, Algeria were left to celebrate booking a semifinal date with Nigeria. Tunisia will face Senegal in the final four after knocking out the minnows from Madagascar. Madagascar 0-3 Tunisia (Sassi 52', Mskani 60', Sliti 90+3') Madagascar's fairy-tale Africa Cup of Nations campaign came to a grinding halt at the quarterfinal stage after Tunisia picked up a 2-0 win, their first of the tournament, at the expense of the islanders. Goalmouth action was at a premium during the opening exchanges of the tie at Cairo's Al Salam Stadium. Tunisia did their best to test Melvin Adrien as often as possible during a turgid first half, but the Madagascar keeper was equal to all their efforts with Whabi Khazri's 33rd-minute free kick drawing the finest of saves. The tie came to life in the second half that started with Khazri having a goal correctly disallowed for offside less than two minutes after the restart. Tunisia were not to be denied twice though and took the lead within five minutes of the decision when Ferjani Sassi's shot took a wicked deflection before nestling in the net. With Madagascar struggling to recreate the magic of their incredible run to the quarterfinals, Tunisia pounced again. Adrien did well to deny Khazri's initial effort, but having failed to keep hold of the ball, was rooted to the spot as Youssef Msakni converted on the rebound.

Everton's Idrissa Gueye scored the only goal of the game with 20 minutes left to play in a second half that also saw Sadio Mane have two goals chalked off for offside. Introduced at the quarter-final stage, it was the first time the VAR video review system had been used at the tournament. Both decisions were correct, but it didn't prevent the Champions League winner, from being the catalyst behind his nation's victory over Benin, who had Olivier Verdon sent-off in the closing stages for a last-man foul. ""We're really happy to qualify, we haven't reached this stage in ages|"" said goalscorer Gueye. ""We controlled the game well and scored the crucial goal."" Senegal, who will play either Madagascar or Tunisia in the semifinals, are now favorites to lift the title for the first time after hosts Egypt were knocked out in the Round of 16 by South Africa. Nigeria 2-1 South Africa (Chukwueze 27', Troost-Ekong 89' - Zungo 71') The Super Eagles secured their place in the final four thanks to a last-gasp winner from central defender William Troost-Ekong. The Udinese man knew little about the strike as he bundled home from close range after finding himself on the end of a searching corner. The goal settled a tight affair in Cairo, with neither side able to assert their dominance for long periods. Samuel Chukuwueze, recalled to the side after being left out in the previous round, put Nigeria ahead in the first half, scoring at the second attempt in the 27th minute to give his side the advantage. That goal was cancelled out in the second half, however, when Bongani Zungo's looping header found the back of Daniel Akpeyi's net. The goal was initially ruled out for offside, but was subsequently awarded with the assistance of VAR. With the clock running down, and the tie heading towards extra-time, Troost-Ekong arrived in the box to deliver the fatal blow, finishing with his knee to send his team through to the final four. Nigeria will now face either Algeria or the Ivory Coast when the semifinals take place on July 14th. German coach Gernot Rohr is hoping to lead the nation to a fourth AFCON title.

Doing the latter will certainly make everything easier!’’ With long-serving right back Lukasz Piszczek having recently turned 34, Morey may well be hoping to fill the Polish international's boots before too long. — June 30 Ozan Kabak's future destination has been decided with the 19-year-old signing a five-year deal with Schalke, joining from Bundesliga 2 outfit Stuttgart following their relegation last season. The highly-rated Turkish center-back had been linked with the likes of AC Milan and Bayern Munich, but becomes the Royal Blues' third signing of the summer. “We’re delighted to have been able to bring one of the biggest young talents in Europe to Schalke 04|"" said sporting director Jochen Schneider.

In three injury-hit seasons with the Royal Blues, the striker made just 61 appearances in all competitions, scoring 12 times in the process, but is looking for a fresh start with the Foals. ""I've only ever head positive things about Borussia from my teammates in the national team|"" said Embolo. ""That's why I'm delighted to have been given the chance to play for this club."" ""We're convinced that we can provide him with a chance for a new start and are expecting to have a lot of fun with him|"" sporting director Max Eberl told the club's website.

Neither club gave any details on the financial details, but German media are reporting that the transfer fee could be as high as €38 million ($42.5 million) including bonuses. Hummels' move in the opposite direction just over three years ago was for a reported €35 million. Hummels, 30, who was dropped from the national team along with Jerome Boateng and Thomas Müller following last year's World Cup in Russia, previously played 306 competitive matches for Dortmund between 2008 and 2016.

Isak, who joined Dortmund from AIK Solna for a reported €8.6 million in January 2017, spent the past half season at Willem II in the Dutch first division, where he scored 13 goals in 16 league games. A Spanish media report suggests that Dortmund have secured a buy-back clause as part of the deal, but that has not been confirmed. — June 10 Schalke have announced the signing of Jonjoe Kenny. The English right-back joins the Gelsenkirchen club on a season-long loan from Premier League side Everton. Kenny is a member of England’s U21 national team, where he has 14 caps to his name. — June 4 It's a biggie. Luka Jovic's move to Real Madrid is officially a done deal. The Spanish club announced the signing of the Serbian international forward from Eintracht Frankfurt on Tuesday afternoon. Jovic, 21, only joined The Eagles permanently earlier in the off season for about €7 million after a prolific loan spell from Benfica saw the poacher rack up 27 goals in 48 games, including 10 on the German side's run to the last four of the Europa League. The fee is thought to be in the region of €65 million but is likely to rise. ""For a sporting point of view Luka Jovic is a great loss for us. His explosiveness and goal threat have been talked about throughout Europe. But it was clear to us that there was a financial reality to it|"" said Frankfurt Sporting Director Fredi Bobic.  Read more: Jovic the man to restore faith at Real Madrid — May 31 Augsburg’s Jonathan Schmid has signed for Freiburg, the club where he started his professional career. The French midfielder has expressed his wishes to move closer to his home region of Elsass, close to the German border. Third Freiburg-related transfer update, and it's indeed a charm! — May 28 Another day, another Freiburg transfer - this time an outgoing one. Florian Niederlechner (28) has signed for Augsburg on a three-year deal. The fee is undisclosed but it seems that it might well see Jonathan Schmid (a former Freiburg player) move in the other direction. ""I only wanted to join Augsburg and blocked all other enquiries|"" Niederlechner said on the club's website. He will add some firepower to Augsburg's attack, but his numbers are modest. In the Bundesliga he has just 17 goals in 80 games. — May 27 Freiburg have made a bit of a splash in the transfer market by securing the services of 20-year-old left back Gian-Luca Itter from Wolfsburg. Itter couldn't get past Jerome Roussillon this season and so made the move to get more first-team football. Itter was voted Germany's best U17 footballer of the year in 2016 and will be keen to get back to that quality at Freiburg. Christian Streich and the Black Forest club is the perfect place for young talent to develop, and Freiburg have apparently had their eye on Itter for the last three years. Jadon Sancho staying put as Borussia Dortmund get business done early After missing out on the Bundesliga title on the final day, Borussia Dortmund acted quickly to wrap up several deals which had already been in the pipeline they hope will help them maintain their challenge next season. In Julian Brandt (pictured above) from Bayer Leverkusen (for a reported €25 million, $28 million) and Thorgan Hazard (a reported €25.5 million) from Borussia Mönchengladbach), the Black and Yellows have snapped up two of the Bundesliga's top attacking talents, while defensive reinforcement has also arrived in the shape of Nico Schulz ( reportedly €25.5 million from Hoffenheim). Paco Alcacer has already made his loan deal from Barcelona permanent while CEO Hans-Joachim Watze has categorically ruled out selling English teenager Jadon Sancho, especially with Christian Pulisic having already joined Chelsea. Despite interest from his home country, Jadon Sancho is staying in Dortmund for the time being Bayern Munich's transition continues - is Leroy Sane next? With Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery having played their final games for Bayern Munich, the big transition is well underway in Bavaria. This season has already seen Joshua Kimmich, Niklas Süle, Serge Gnabry, Kingsley Coman and Leon Goretzka establish themselves and the German double winners aren't finished yet. The Bavarians have already concluded deals for 23-year-old French World Cup-winning center backs Lucas Hernandez (a reported €80 million from Atletico Madrid) and Benjamin Pavard (reportedly €35 million from Stuttgart), while youthful potential will also arrive in the form of teenager Jann-Fiete Arp (reportedly €3 milllion from Hamburg). Brazilian fullback Rafinha and Colombian midfielder James are both expected to leave the club, while German media outlets seem increasingly confident that Manchester City winger Leroy Sane is the next target. Reports in Manchester however suggest that the English champions are looking to extend the German international's contract. Watch this space ... Is Leroy Sane next on Bayern's wish list? Kerem Demirbay (Hoffenheim to Bayer Leverkusen) With Julian Nagelsmann Leipzig-bound, Hoffenheim are also set to lose a key figure on the pitch. Kerem Demirbay has come on leaps and bounds since moving to Sinsheim in 2016, having a hand in 38 goals (12 goals and 26 assists) in 87 appearances in all competitions, and wants to take the next step in Leverkusen with a view to adding to his two caps for the German national team. Filip Kostic (Hamburg to Eintracht Frankfurt) After being relegated with Stuttgart in 2016 and Hamburg in 2018, few would have expected Kostic to be a contender for ""signing of the season"" when he joined Frankfurt on a two-year loan deal. The Serbian has been a revelation in Adi Hütter's system, playing in 45 of a possible 49 games in all competitions, making Eintracht's decision to trigger the buy-out clause a no-brainer. Finally found a home: Filip Kostic is enjoying life in Frankfurt Ihlas Bebou (Hannover to Hoffenheim) Heavily linked with a move to Borussia Mönchengladbach, there was a surprise twist in the tale for Ihlas Bebou when it was announced he had signed a contract until 2023 with Hoffenheim. The 25-year-old forward, who has 41 Bundesliga outings to his name, scored four goals and laid on three assists, but was limited to just 11 appearances due to torn thigh tendons. Niclas Füllkrug (Hannover to Werder Bremen) A product of Bremen's academy, Füllkrug (right) is set to return just under five years since he left to join Nuremberg. The striker's 14 goals helped Hannover survive the 2017-18 campaign, but cartilage damage in his knee restricted him to just 14 games and two goals this past season. Nevertheless, Werder were willing to take the risk. Bayern made Hernandez the Bundesliga's record signing by splashing out €80 million ($89.7 million) for the versatile center-back, who will also provide cover for David Alaba. A powerful defender with plenty of room to grow, the 23-year-old is one of two members from France's World Cup winning side in 2018 set to join the club this summer… …the other is fellow 23-year-old Pavard, who already has over 60 Bundesliga appearances to his name. After the triumph in Russia, it was clear the Frenchman was destined for bigger things and, while other sides were interested, Pavard claimed ""Bayern were the only ones for me"". €35 million ($39.2 million) looks to be an absolute bargain. With Julian Nagelsmann Leipzig-bound, Hoffenheim are also set to lose a key figurehead on the pitch. Demirbay has come on leaps and bounds since moving to Sinsheim in 2016, having a hand in 38 goals (12 goals & 26 assists) in 87 appearances in all competitions, and wants to take the next step in Leverkusen with a view to adding to his 2 caps for the German national team. A player that had caught the interest of Barcelona and Borussia Dortmund among others, 18-year-old Candido (right) has been touted as one of the hottest defensive talents in Brazil. A left-back trade with 8 appearances for Brazil's Under-20s to his name, Leipzig kept tabs on Candido for ""half a year"" before making the move to bring him to Saxony. Wolf (center) boasts a wealth of experience and title-winning exploits that would be the envy of most players his age. A three time Austrian champion and a UEFA Youth League winner, the 20-year-old felt it was ""time to take the next step"". Since 2012, Wolf is the 18th player to move from Salzburg to sister club Leipzig, who wrapped up the transfer back in December. After being relegated with Stuttgart in 2016 and Hamburg in 2018, few would have expected Kostic to be a contender for 'signing of the season' when he joined Frankfurt on a two-year loan deal. The Serb has been a revelation in Adi Hütter's system, playing in 45 of a possible 49 games in all competitions, making Eintracht's decision to trigger the buy-ou clause a no brainer. With Paul Verhaegh leaving and reinforcements needed at right-back, Wolfsburg turned to four-time Switzerland international Mbabu (right). The 24-year-old, formerly on the books at Premier League outfit Newcastle, has featured in the Champions League and won back-to-back titles since making his loan move to Young Boys permanent in 2017. With Oliver Glasner taking over as head coach in the summer, Wolfsburg have brought in one of the key members of his LASK side with Joao Victor making the move to Northern Germany. The 25-year-old Brazilian has had a hand in 31 goals (19 goals & 12 assists) in 33 games for the Austrian side in the current campaign. Heavily linked with a move to Borussia Mönchengladbach, there was a surprise twist in the tale for Bebou when it was announced he had signed a contract until 2023 with Hoffenheim. The 25-year-old forward, who has 41 Bundesliga outings to his name, scored four goals and laid on three assists, but was limited to just 11 appearances due to torn thigh tendons. With Germany international Nico Schulz reportedly set to leave the club, Hoffenheim have snapped up Augsburg's Stafylidis (right) to provide cover. The Greek left-back only made one appearance before Christmas, but has made nine starts in the second half of the season and is now ""eagerly anticipating then chance to prove myself in this incredible environment"" with 1899. Hoffenheim triggered a release clause to make Adamyan (left) their first signing of the summer with sporting director Alexander Rosen referring to him as a ""very exciting player"". An international teammate of former Borussia Dortmund star Henrikh Mkhitaryan with Armenia, the 25-year-old has been in blistering form this season grabbing 15 goals and 11 assists in the 2. Bundesliga Goller (center) first came to the attention of Bundesliga fans in December when he made his professional debut for Schalke, starting in their must-win UEFA Champions League group game against Lokomotiv Moskva. The winger hasn't featured for the Royal Blues since and, as a result, has sought out regular first-team football with a move to Bremen. A product of Bremen's academy, Füllkrug (right) is set to return just under five years since he left to join Nuremberg. The striker's 14 goals helped Hannover survive the 2017/18 campaign, but cartilage damage in his knee restricted him to just 14 games and two goals this season. Nevertheless, Werder were willing to take the risk. Ji (2nd from left) has been bouncing around the Bundesliga since joining Augsburg from Sunderland in 2013 and, after spells with Dortmund and Darmstadt, will make Mainz his fourth different station in Germany. The South Korean is still only 27 and, while he may not be the most prolific striker, he has a real penchant for scoring important goals. Just ask BVB. The 28-year-old Belgian defender moves on a free to the capital, signing a deal until 2022. Business manager Michael Preetz said Boyata had been a target for some time. The Belgian joins having won eight trophies with Celtic, and a year after being part of Belgium's World Cup squad.

Natnael Berhane: This is my second Tour de France, and I want to come back for more in the next few years. But first of all I want to produce some good results in this year's edition. My dream is text to get a stage win. What would a stage win mean to you? Obviously it would change my life. But of course it's hard to win a stage at the Tour de France. So if you do manage to win one, it's a big deal. A victory for me would also be a great inspiration for all African riders. I would like to motivate more talented Africans to take up cycling, and a stage win could help pave the way for other African riders to turn professional. Read more: Tour de France starts in Belgium: Cycling as a lifestyle What has the support been like in your own country? When I raced in the national championship in Eritrea the support was great. When they heard that I had been selected for the Tour de France everyone went crazy. That was very motivating. I was also surprised by how hard the other Eritrean riders raced and how good they were. I hope that some of them will also have the chance to come to Europe. I'm 100 percent sure that these talents would develop better if they could also come to Europe and join the pro peloton. Natnael Berhane cycles along the Wall of Geraardsbergen on the first stage of the Tour What drives you? Good results. All professional cyclists work hard, but if you actually achieve something, this motivates you even more. For me, winning the national championship and making it to the Tour de France gave me an extra boost. And two months ago my son was born. This was another motivation. It's very good to have a child in my life. How did you get into cycling? I started learning to ride a bike when I was four or five years old. When I got older I started mountain biking and rode more regulary. In 2005 I entered in first competitions on the mountain bike. At the end of 2006 I swept to the road bike. Who supported you at the time? When I began my parents didn't like it, especially my mother. When I started racing I didn't tell my parents about it. I won some medals but my parents didn't know about it. At the end of 2005 I was at the top of the regional mountainbike championship. So I said to my parents: ""I can win the championship, I need your support next Sunday."" My mother was angry with me and told me that I shouldn't race again. But fortunately, the rest of my family managed to change her mind. My father got on board with the idea, and I won the championship. After this my father supported my and bought me a road bike. My mother was mad at him as she didn't wanted me to race because she was worried that I might crash. She was also afraid that I could leave school because of cycling. In 2014 Berhane (third from left) won the Tropicale Amissa Bongo in Gabon Was she right? I was spending a lot of time thinking about cycling (laughs). In the end my mother supported me a lot. Now she even comes to see me race. When I race in Eritrea she always comes out and supports me. How did you make your way to Europe? I came here in 2011 after racing in Eritrea, Ruanda and Gabon. It started with the World Cycling Centre in in Aigle, [operated by the International Cycling Union]. Everything was completely different. I saw snow for the first time in my life. I asked myself: ""Whats going on here?"" (laughs). My first training ride in Europe was in the rain, that was incredible for me at the time. I was lucky enough to spend two years there before turning professional. Did you face more obstacles than the European cyclists? Yes, I think so. They raced and then they went home. But for me it was different. I stayed here for several months before going back home, because it was so far away. But not just we African riders struggle with this, it's the same for American or Australian riders. The 2019 Tour de France route African cycling seems to have been improving over the past few years. But now there are only three of you at the Tour de France. What's gone wrong? Africa's Team Dimension Data usually brought several riders, at least four riders. Not just here but to other races too. We were racing at a high level, but now their strategy has changed. I think they should give opportunities to African riders, give them the chance to shine. This year they only brought one, Reinardt Janse van Rensburg. As far as I'm concerned, there should be more riders from our continent on Africa's team. When will we see the first African Tour de France winner? I think in a few years' time. Egan Bernal is an inspiration. He comes from Colombia and has an incredible power. He can win it. And maybe in a few years somebody like him from Africa can win it too. Natnael Berhane, 28, is an Eritrean professional cyclist, who is competing in this year's Tour de France for the French team Cofidis. He has won numerous titles including the road races at the African Road Championships in 2011 and 2013. He is the current Eritrean road race champion. The interview was conducted by Joscha Weber. Even without Chris Froome, this race will be exciting. The Tour de France promises suspense, even if Team Sky (now called Ineos after a sponsor change) remain the strongest. Our look at the rest of the field shows who will be a threat to the British team. Sunken cheeks, deep-set eyes, skinny limbs and and shaven hair - Enric Mas looks scary to many onlookers. The 24-year-old Spaniard is perfectly healthy and extremely well trained. Mas is strong in the mountains, and was a surprising second in the 2018 Vuelta. This year though, he has been unremarkable. Prediction: It won't be enough for a spot at the front of the pack. Has Nairo Quintana's time already come and gone? From 2013 to 2016 he was consistently in the top four at the Tour, Giro and Vuelta. He was a powerhouse on the mountains, but recently the quiet Colombian has struggled. He has shied away from media appointments, notably around the tough ascents. This will likely be his last chance as captain on the Tour. Prediction: He won't take his chance. The hopes of many lie heavy on the on the thin shoulders of Romain Bardet. The gangly climber was meant to end the long drought of the French at the Tour. In recent years, it looked like he was closing in on this goal but at the moment, Bardet, who has a degree in management, is chasing both opponents and his good form. Prediction: He'll lose too much time in the time trial. ""We have taken different paths, but are still close and talk to each other every day|"" Adam Yates said of his relationship to his twin brother Simon. Both are talented contenders in the same classification. In France, Simon, who was captain at the Giro, will likely ride for Adam. He's good on the mountains and solid in time trials. Prediction: Has a chance, but won't win. A talented rider has now become a potential podium finisher – Emanuel Buchmann impressed in the preparation races for the Tour. The quiet German has become one of the best on the mountain, and has improved in the time trial. The 26-year-old is still lacking the punch and the confidence to seal the big win. Predicton: He'll keep getting better. The double of the Giro and the Tour last year proved to be too ambitious. The experienced ""shark from Messina"" will remember the trials of the race in Italy, one he lost due to a tactical mistake. But his consistency and passion will see the 34-year-old pick up points again. Prediction: The shark is a few teeth short of a strong bite. He is over his fear of the descent and has improved on his time trial – is Thibaut Pinot finally ready for a good finish? Nearly. The Frenchman continues to improve and is focused on the Tour. His team is good, but the others are better. Prediction: Pinot will attack, but won't be able to hold off all his opponents. The defending champion had a moment of shock during the Tour de Suisse. After a bad crash, his dream of a second Tour victory appeared lost. But the 33-year-old Welshman can and will be at the Tour. His preparation wasn't perfect - this year won't be as comfortable as last year. Prediction: He'll still be on the podium. For years, the Dane found himself in the service of other top riders: Jakob Fuglsang rode for the Schleck brothers and was also in the shadows of the Astana team. Now he is captain and it's about time too. He has been the most consistent of all the Tour candidates, and has improved up the mountain as well. Prediction: He will get very close to the yellow jersey. Viva Colombia! The cycling-crazy nation is excited about the next star, one who will enrapture his home country. Egan Bernal has shown exceptional performances of late and as a member of Ineos, he is on one of the strongest teams. At the Tour de Suisse, he was unbeatable. Now he could put his stamp on the Tour. Prediction: He will have Colombia celebrating. Author: Joscha Weber"|"Natnael Berhane of Eritrea is the only black African rider in the Tour de France.

One only has to stand next to the Tour de France route to understand why this day is so special for French cyclists. Even the smallest villages along the course, all the houses are decorated with French flags or old bicycles wrapped in blue, white and red adhesive tape. Hours before the peloton is expected, people meet in the street, set up tables and chairs, light their grills — all for the few seconds in which the group of riders rushes by. Then they cheer for what the race has to offer. It's no wonder that the greatest feeling for French cyclists is to win a Tour de France stage on Bastille day — or to ride all day in the yellow jersey. That is exactly what Julian Alaphilippe had in mind. Man with a plan At the first mountain stage of this year's Tour de France on Thursday, Alaphilippe had lost the yellow jersey which he had worn for three days to Italian Giulio Ciccone. The French rider wanted to take it back on Saturday during the eighth stage, a 200-kilometer (124-mile) stretch from Macon to Saint-Etienne in eastern France. The crowd favorite was only six seconds behind Ciccone entering the stage. And this was Alaphilippe's plan, which he revealed in an interview before the start in Macon. ""When the breakaways are captured, I will try to win some bonus points|"" he said. These bonus seconds were given for finishing in the top three of the stage as well as for the last climb up the Cote de la Jaillere 12.5 kilometers before Saint-Etienne. There was only one runaway left, Belgian Thomas De Gendt. Thibaut Pinot (right) looks back at Julian Alaphilippe (left) after finishing the eighth stage of the Tour de France Pushing for points Alaphilippe made his proclamation come true. Together with his compatriot Thibaut Pinot, the former soldier attacked the steepest point of the climb and took second place in the stage behind stage winner Thomas De Gendt, earning a five-second time credit. Shortly thereafter, Alaphilippe took third place in the stage behind De Gendt, who crowned his solo sprint with the day's victory, and Pinot, earning another four bonus seconds. That was enough for the 27-year-old Frenchman to snatch the yellow jersey away from Ciccone. The Italian finished with the main peloton 26 seconds behind stage winner De Gendt and 20 seconds behind Alaphilippe. Combined with the nine bonus seconds, Ciccone's six-second advantage became a 23-second lead for the Frenchman, who will don the yellow jersey for the ninth stage. And all that just in time for Bastille day. Cheers from Alaphilippe's fellow countrymen on Sunday are a certainty. DW sends out a daily selection of hard news and quality feature journalism.

It is the second Grand Slam title for Halep, her first coming at last year's French Open. The seventh-seeded Romanian got out to a roaring start in the first set, breaking Williams twice in the first three games. Williams, who was attempting to tie Margaret Court's Grand Slam singles title record, battled back in the second set, holding serve to take a 2-1 lead. But the seven-time Wimbledon champion fell apart after that, with Halep breaking serve twice more before holding serve to clinch the championship. Read more: Cori Gauff is tennis' next big thing ""She really played out of her mind. It was a bit of deer in the headlights for me|"" Williams said in an interview on Centre Court afterward. Williams finished the match with 25 unforced errors, the final of which handed Halep the victory. Halep, meanwhile, was nearly flawless, committing just 3 unforced errors in the victory. When asked if she has played a better match in her career, Halep said: ""Never. It was the best match."" Wimbledon is the world's oldest tennis tournament and is held annually at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet club in Wimbledon, London. In 2009, its Centre Court was fitted with a retractable roof to lessen the loss of playing time due to rain. There are 18 courts used for the Championships (and 22 practice courts) and it takes 15 months and nine tonnes of grass seed to prepare the courts. In modern sports, where advertising dominates team kits and color is everywhere, there is something brilliant about the fact that the kits of Wimbledon players must be 90 percent white. White does not include cream or off-white, just white. Originally, it was to avoid sweat showing. Andre Agassi's wild taste was tamed in the 90s, while Roger Federer's orange-soled shoes weren't part of the code. It might look like good fun being a ball boy/girl at Wimbledon, but training for those in charge of the balls and the towels is perhaps tougher than any other tournament. The 14 to 18-year-old school children train for five months and from 700 applicants, only 250 end up on the coveted grass. The average age is 15 and most spend two years as a ball boy/girl. Apart from the green of the grass and the white of the kit, the other color often seen at Wimbledon is red. Strawberries and cream are the tournament's favorite dish. During the tournament, 28,000 kilograms of strawberries and 10,000 liters of fresh cream are eaten. Add to that the 320,000 glasses of Pimm's, 29,000 bottles of champagne and 25,000 scones then it's no surprise Wimbledon is awesome. One thing about grass that other tournaments can't offer is more remarkable shots. A 17-year-old Boris Becker made it famous when he won hearts and the Wimbledon trophy in 1985, but his famous dive carried on even after he stopped played. In 2011, Novak Djokovic and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga had an incredible rally of diving shots, while Dustin Brown did the same against Lleyton Hewitt in 2013. Both the men's and women's trophies are some of the finest in sport. The Rosewater Dish, the trophy for the women's single champion, has a mythological theme and has the Roman goddess of wisdom and strategic warfare (Minerva) etched around the rim. The champions receive a three-quarter size replica with all the previous champions engraved, as well as the $2.8 million both winners receive. dv/ftm (AP, Reuters) DW sends out a daily selection of hard news and quality feature journalism.

"a-49524996"|"https://www.dw.com/en/bundesliga-transfers-where-should-the-champions-league-clubs-look-to-strengthen/a-49524996"|"Ed McCambridge"|"Bayern Munich ""We are still waiting, all the clubs are waiting for the first big transfer. Until now there has not been one big transfer to act as domino effect|"" said Bayern CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, on Monday, with regard to the transfer window. Evidently, Rummenigge doesn’t consider his club’s €80m ($90m) outlay on left-back Lucas Hernandez a “big transfer” but rival clubs might disagree. The truth is, Bayern have only recently jumped aboard the silly money bandwagon and aren’t entirely comfortable admitting it. They’ve previously taken pride in avoiding PSG-level transfer fees but results, particularly in the Champions League, have seen them make a U-turn. An aging defense has been upgraded with the expensive arrivals of Hernandez and international teammate Benjamin Pavard, a €35m ($40m) arrival from Stuttgart. At 23 years old, both represent a sound investment for the future, while Mats Hummels’ return to Borussia Dortmund has helped fund those arrivals and reduce the overall age of the squad. Bayern will need to loosen the purse strings further though, with new recruits required in the forward roles. Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery’s departures mean Bayern are light in the wide areas, and could do with at least one ready-made star to plug the gap. Meanwhile, their decision not to make an offer for James Rodriguez, after his two-year loan spell from Real Madrid, means they are short on creativity. Jann-Fiete Arp, the 19-year old signed from Hamburg this season, is more likely one for the future. A fresh offer for Chelsea youngster Callum Hudson-Odoi is expected over the coming days, but a statement signing, such as Leroy Sane from Manchester City, will be needed in a forward role to convince fans Champions League success is a priority. Borussia Dortmund A savvy start to the transfer window has seen Dortmund add two of the Bundesliga’s brightest attacking talents for less than Chelsea paid to take Christian Pulisic off their hands. While the American had bags of potential, few would argue wingers Thorgan Hazard, a €26m ($29m) capture from Gladbach, and Germany international Julian Brandt, €25m ($28m) from Leverkusen, aren’t worthy replacements. Julian Brandt's arrival from Bayer Leverkusen is seen as something of a coup for the Black and Yellows. Defense has also been given a much needed boost, with former captain Mats Hummels, a €31m ($35m) arrival from Bayern Munich, and left back Nico Schulz from Hoffenheim clear upgrades on existing personnel. Hummels, in particular, should have an impact, with his experience and leadership expected to galvanize an often chaotic backline. Centre-forward remains an issue, with Paco Alcacer not consistent enough and Marco Reus better deployed in a playmaker role. Central midfield is also a concern, with little top quality backup beyond Julian Weigl should Thomas Delaney and Axel Witsel become injured. This should be a priority over the coming weeks. RB Leipzig Arguably the most interesting arrival across the entire Bundesliga comes in the shape of new coach Julian Nagelsmann. The former Hoffenheim boss is widely regarded the most exciting German coach since Jürgen Klopp, and many fans were surprised to see him take on the challenge at Leipzig when a move to a larger club seemed a certainty in the not-too-distant future. That being said, Nagelsmann now has a superior squad at his disposal; one young enough to learn his philosophies and a larger budget than ever to work with. Transfer-wise, Leipzig have been linked with a swoop for former loan-star Ademola Lookman from Everton, but their new coach’s main aim will be to convince key players to stay. Striker Timo Werner and young centre-backs Dayot Upamecano and Ibrahima Konate should be summoned to Nagelsmann's office as soon as possible. Bayer Leverkusen The loss of Julian Brandt was compensated for quickly and efficiently with the signing of Kerem Demirbay from Hoffenheim. At €32m ($36m), the midfielder didn’t come cheap, but he’ll offer the squad a different type of attacking threat to Brandt. While the latter is a highly technical, waifish playmaker, Demirbay will provide a more robust, industrious presence behind the centre-forward, and should weigh in with plenty of goals and assists. Kerem Demirbay celebrates a goal for Hoffenheim in October 2018. The €12m capture of 20-year old left-winger Moussa Diaby from PSG may turn out to be smart business, but the Frenchman isn’t expected to start given Leverkusen’s embarrassment of riches in the forward positions. Between Leon Baily, Kevin Volland, Lucas Alario, Demirbay, Karim Bellerabi and prized wunderkind Kai Havertz goals shouldn’t be hard to come by, but the same old issues remain in midfield and defense. These will need to be addressed if the club is to have any real impact on the league or in Europe."|"The transfer window may be just getting started, but the Bundesliga’s Champions League participants have already been busy.

"a-49590966"|"https://www.dw.com/en/four-kids-in-australia-steal-car-and-drive-1000-kilometers/a-49590966"|""|"Four children aged 10 to 14 stole a parent's SUV and drove about 1,000 kilometers down the Australian east coast before they were stopped by police on Sunday police said. Police said the children had departed from the Central Queensland town of Rockhampton and were stopped in the town of Grafton in New South Wales. When they were pulled over, the young adventurers locked the doors and refused to get out, Acting Police Inspector Darren Williams said. A police officer then used a baton to break a window of the Nissan Patrol vehicle, which had been reported stolen, Williams said. Farewell note contents unknown Police are uncertain as to how many children were involved in driving the vehicle, but it was possible that they had shared the task. To apply for a driving licence in Queensland, a person must be 17 years old. The only European country without a general speed limit on most parts of its highways, Germany nonetheless has an excellent network of motorways. They are generally well-maintained, inviting you to explore them. The minimum age for obtaining a driver's license used with a legal guardian present in Germany is 17. An unrestricted car driver's license can be granted at age 18. According to statistics by ADAC, Germany's national automobile association, traffic jams increased by around 15 percent in 2016 as compared to the previous year. That's a lot for a relatively small country. The increase resulted from both more cars on the highway, and more construction sites. So brace yourself for more time and stress in the car, especially around big cities. Even when you think you're soaring down the autobahn, you may get the distinct impression it's still not fast enough. Some German drivers may drive right up behind you and try to ""push"" you over. They may even flash their headlights to rattle your nerves. You aren't supposed to block the ""fast"" lane — the aim being to only use it for passing. But don't let pushy drivers bully you! Watch out for speed cameras! They are used widely in Germany, from the autobahn to inner city areas. These box-shaped devices are installed next to the road, and will often catch you unawares. Should you be driving over the speed limit, a ticket will be sent to your house, complete with a picture of you at the wheel and the license plate confirming your offense. Holding a cell phone in your hand while driving is an absolute no-no. If caught, you could be fined 100 euros ($124) and get a one-point penalty against your driver's license. Penalties spike up if you cause an accident, and you may have your license revoked. Fines were raised in 2017. Investing in a hands-free car kit is smarter. Penalties also apply to bicyclists using their cell phones. The same thing goes for not making way for emergency vehicles. Once traffic jams up, you are required to create a lane for ambulances and police, even before you see the flashing lights behind you. If not, you could be fined at least 200 euros (around $250) and get points on your license. The emergency lane is always between the far left and the rest of the lanes. You are also required to set up a warning signal should you break down or have an accident. This means placing an orange metal triangle on the road, donning a fluorescent jacket, both of which you must have in your car. You must also have a first-aid kit stored in your vehicle. In Germany, there's zero tolerance for beginners, as well as for professional drivers. There's a 0.05 percent blood alcohol content (BAC) limit to driving under the influence. Bicyclists may not exceed 0.16 percent. Penalties start at a €500 ($623) fine, points off your license and even a one-month license suspension. Best bet: don't drink and drive! Snow tires are required once streets become slick with slush, ice or snow. In Germany, the rule of thumb is that this can occur anytime between October and Easter. Should you not have snow tires installed on your car and still drive on slippery streets, you could be fined and have points taken off your license. Without proper snow tires, your insurance may also not cover an accident. To navigate both the German autobahn and city streets, the best approach is a zen one: take your time and don't let yourself get frazzled. Besides, with an expansive train and public transportation system in the country, you might not even want to hop into your car, but board a train and put up your feet!

I couldn't imagine one person actually driving all that way in two days|"" Williams told reporters.

"a-49575351"|"https://www.dw.com/en/reporters-in-turkey-adopt-a-new-beat-imprisoned-journalists/a-49575351"|"Ole Tangen Jr"|"This brief notice was a part of the ""Upcoming trials"" series featured on the website and the Twitter account of the Media and Law Studies Association (MLSA), a media freedom and legal rights organization in Turkey. It was founded by journalist Evin Baris Altintas in 2017 to track and document the cases against journalists, writers and academics imprisoned or charged with crimes after the failed coup against Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in July 2016. Parlak's trial is one of dozens of cases that MLSA is monitoring. Altintas believes the reason Turkish authorities targeted certain individuals is because they wanted to silence those willing to speak out against Erdogan and his policies. Freedom of expression and media freedom are protected by Turkish law. ""Nobody should be in jail for writing an article or a tweet|"" said Altintas. In order to track whether the Turkish judiciary is following established legal procedures in their handling of these proceedings, MLSA monitors numerous cases as they make their way through the Turkish judicial system. When a hearing takes place, freelance reporters or employees of the project attend and subsequently publish the developments in both Turkish and English. The goal is to bring the greatest possible exposure to these cases, both inside and outside Turkey. ""We send monitors to as many hearings as we can so that we can document them and ensure that a record of these cases will exist regardless of what happens in the future|"" said Altintas. After years of free market reforms, Turkey's transition slowly begins to reverse. Islamist Abdullah Gul's candidacy as president in 2007 marks a clear shift away from secularist policies, and strains relations between the ruling AKP and the military. However, with broad support from both conservative Muslims and liberals, the AKP wins the parliamentary elections and Gul is elected president. Then-Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan tables a constitutional reform increasing parliamentary control of the judiciary and army, effectively allowing the government to pick judges and senior military officials. The amendment, which is combined with measures also aimed at protecting child rights and the strengthening of the right to appeal, passed by a wide margin in a public referendum. Pent-up anger directed by young people at Erdogan, Gul and the Islamist-rooted AKP hits a boiling point in May 2013. The violent police breakup of a small sit-in aimed at protecting Istanbul's Gezi Park spurs one of the fiercest anti-government protests in years. Eleven people are killed and more than 8,000 injured, before the demonstrations eventually peter out a month later. A fragile ceasefire deal between the Turkish government and the Kurdish rebel PKK group breaks under the weight of tensions aggravated by the war in Syria. Military forces resume operations in the mostly Kurdish southeast of Turkey. In early 2016, the Kurdistan Freedom Hawks (TAK) — a breakaway PKK faction — claim responsibility for two bombings in Ankara, each killing 38 people. A military coup attempt against the government shakes Turkey to its core and briefly turns the country into a war zone. Some 260 civilians die in overnight clashes with the army across five major cities. Erdogan, however, rallies supporters and the following morning rebel soldiers are ambushed by thousands of civilians on the Bosporus Bridge. The troops eventually drop their guns and surrender. In the aftermath of the failed coup, Erdogan announces a state of emergency, leading to arrests of tens of thousands of suspected coup sympathizers and political opponents. Among those detained are military and judiciary officials and elected representatives from the pro-Kurdish HDP party. The purge is later expanded to include civil servants, university officials and teachers. As part of Erdogan's crackdown against supposed ""terrorist sympathizers|"" Turkey becomes one of the world's leading jailers of journalists, according to Reporters Without Borders. The government shuts down around 110 media outlets in the year following the coup and imprisons more than 100 journalists, including German-Turkish correspondent Deniz Yücel. With a referendum on expanding Erdogan's presidential powers set for April 2016, AKP officials look to galvanize support among Turks living in Europe, particularly in Germany and the Netherlands. However, the Netherlands forbids Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu from landing in the country, while Germany opts to cancel two rallies. Erdogan accuses both countries of Nazi-style repression. Erdogan narrowly wins the referendum vote expanding his power. As a result, Turkey's parliamentary system is abolished in favor of a strong executive presidency. Erdogan is also allowed to remain in power potentially until 2029. However, international election monitors claim that opposition voices were muzzled and that media coverage was dominated by figures from the ""yes"" campaign. Erdogan secures a new five-year term and sweeping new executive powers after winning landmark elections on June 24. His AKP and their nationalist allies also win a majority in parliament. International observers criticize the vote, saying media coverage and emergency measures gave Erdogan and the AKP an ""undue advantage"" in the vote. Author: David Martin Basic laws ignored MLSA is just one of a number of organizations tracking the trials of journalists, including the Platform for Independent Journalism (P24) and the International Press Institute (IPI) through their #FreeTurkeyJournalists project. IPI also partners with MLSA for trial monitoring. #FreeTurkeyJournalists is an online campaign which, according to its mission statement, intends to ""illustrate the severity of Turkey's crackdown on journalists by highlighting the cases of individuals who have been detained and who face criminal charges.""

IPI is a Vienna-based organization made up of a network of media executives and leading journalists working together to defend media freedom.The organization has been working in Turkey since 1960 and has tracked the situation there since a state of emergency was declared by the Erdogan government following the coup attempt. It has counted 252 journalists and media executives who have been subject to prosecution, of which 135 journalists remain behind bars. Their research also found that 140 media outlets have been forcibly closed since the state of emergency was enacted, leaving hundreds of journalists out of a job.  Most of the media outlets critical of President Erdogan have been shuttered ""The state of emergency following the coup attempt was abused by the state to silence its critics and retaliate against journalistic scrutiny|"" said Scott Griffen, IPI's deputy director. ""Unfortunately, even though the state of emergency has been lifted, many of the measures introduced were carried over and the repression has continued."" IPI believes the rights of the journalists facing prosecution have been violated under Turkish law and that the judiciary ignores basic fair trial and due process guarantees. Griffen hopes that by shedding light onto the specific ways in which these violations occur, the IPI's work will make it clear to relevant international actors and institutions that the Turkish justice system is not protecting the rights of defendants. ""We are concerned about the potential long-term damage that the ongoing media crackdown has had on the exercise of journalism in Turkey|"" said Griffen. ""The infrastructure of quality media has been seriously damaged and a generation of journalists faces an uncertain future in the profession."" In a move that has been welcomed by the journalism community and media freedom organizations, a Turkish court recently overturned the life sentences for journalists Ahmet Altan and Nazli Ilicak, though their case is continuing. The two men were arrested in 2016 for allegedly encouraging the coup, and their case has garnered much media attention and international criticism.

Many observers wonder if democracy in Turkey is possible without a free press Surrounded by supporters As most of the media houses that are still publishing in Turkey have either been co-opted by the Turkish state or are owned by Erdogan supporters, details of these trials are being largely ignored. MLSA's Altintas hopes the attention being brought to these cases by media freedom organizations will pressure the government to drop any charges against journalists who were just doing their jobs. ""Our main motivation is to empower people in the media today, especially those being harassed legally, to know that they're not alone|"" said Altintas, adding that her organization does not just focus on the cases of noted journalists, but also those who have been arrested in towns and cities far from Istanbul and Ankara. ""We're not interested in anybody's political ideology or background; we only look at your indictment|"" said Altintas, who has herself been present at many hearing for Kurdish journalists, members of an ethnic minority that has been especially targeted during the crackdown.

"a-49594914"|"https://www.dw.com/en/spain-pm-sanchez-says-talks-with-far-left-have-failed/a-49594914"|""|"Spain's caretaker prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, on Monday accused the far-left Podemos (We Can) party of breaking off negotiations on forming a new government, just over a week before he is to face a confidence vote in Parliament. Sanchez accused Podemos' leader Pablo Iglesias of ""unilaterally"" ending the talks. Sanchez is seeking support from Podemos and other regional parties for a minority government after he and his Socialists won April elections but failed to gain the absolute parliamentary majority necessary to govern alone. The Socialists have ruled out a formal coalition with Podemos, but Sanchez last week said he was ready to give some ministerial posts to people deemed as acceptable by the far-left party. The proposal has been rejected by Iglesias, with Podemos making its support conditional on some of its actual leaders being included in the Cabinet. Read more: Spanish Franco-era 'stolen babies' campaigner finds her family Confidence votes in the balance In an interview on SER radio on Monday, Sanchez called on two major rightist parties to abstain in the confidence vote next Tuesday to allow him to win and lead a minority government. If he fails to gain an absolute majority of 176 voters in the 350-seat lower house, another vote will be held two days later where he needs only a simple majority. If no new government can be formed, new elections would automatically be held on September 23. If called, they would be the fourth in four years in Spain. Sanchez, 47, came to power in June 2018 after a no-confidence motion filed by the Socialists against the then conservative Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy was passed, partly with the support of Podemos. Each year between June 27 and 30, thousands of locals and tourists participate in the annual Wine Battle in Spain's Rioja wine-growing region. The event is known around the area as La Batalla del Vino de Haro, or the Wine Battle of Haro. Haro is one of the most important wine producers in the region. Up to 40% of La Rioja's vineyards are located in the town. The area is completely devoted to producing wine, which contributes majorly to its economy. People throw wine at each other, with organizers saying the aim is to ""cover your neighbor in wine as quickly and completely as you can."" Participants may use wine-filled water pistols, garden sprays or buckets and party until the 70,000 liters (15,397 imperial gallons) of free wine run out. The wine fight starts on the eve of June 28. The whole town of Haro gathers on the streets, from children to grandparents. They party all night in the picturesque Spanish squares.

"a-49590781"|"https://www.dw.com/en/chinas-gdp-growth-slumps-to-27-year-low-amid-trade-war-with-us/a-49590781"|""|"The Chinese economy has suffered a loss of momentum in the second quarter, with the GDP falling to 6.2 % from a 6.4 % expansion in the first three months of the year, figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Monday. The growth rate, the slowest since at least 1992, reflects growing pressure on the world's second-largest economy as a Sino-US trade war drags on and demand for Chinese goods slackens in the rest of the world. ""Economic conditions are still severe both at home and abroad, global economic growth is slowing down and the external instabilities and uncertainties are increasing|"" said NBS spokesman Mao Shengyong. The 6.2 % figure falls within Beijing's target range of 6.0 to 6.5% for the entire year, after the economy registered 6.6 % growth in 2018. Read more: China keeps global tech leadership firmly in sight Boosting measures Government measures taken to boost growth, such as massive tax cuts worth nearly 2 trillion yuan ($291 billion; €258 billion), have so far failed to offset the slowdown. On Monday, the central bank also finalized a previously announced cut to the reserve requirement ratios (RRR) for small and medium-sized banks. The slump came despite some bright spots in the economy in June, such as a rise in industrial output of 6.3 % from a year before, and retail sales jumping 9.8 % to the fastest rate since March 2018. The trade conflict between China and the US, which is using tariffs to try and force Beijing to open up its economy, has fueled worries of a global recession. The two economic giants together have now imposed punitive tariffs covering $360 billion in two-way trade. High-level trade talks that resumed this month has so far not succeeded in bridging the differences between the two sides.

Han Kuo-yu beat four other contenders in the Nationalist Party primary, including the former chairman of Foxconn Technology, billionaire Terry Gou, to win the nomination. Han, who has been mayor of Kaohsiung since November, will challenge President Tsai Ing-wen in the January contest. Read more: Can Taiwan counter China's mounting pressure? He provoked controversy earlier this year after he met with senior Chinese officials and signed deals with four Chinese cities to sell agricultural goods worth 5.2 billion New Taiwan dollars ($165 million, €149 million). The 62-year-old has described the prospect of Taiwan's full independence from the mainland as ""more scary"" than syphilis. China considers the self-ruled island a breakaway region. Tsai enters the presidential race weakened by the poor performance of her Democratic Progressive Party in local elections in late 2018. After the end of WWII, the Communist Party of China (CPC) under Mao Zedong pursued a fierce battle against his archrival Chiang Kai-shek, chief of the Kuomintang (KMT) party. Chiang lost and took refuge in the island of Taiwan. For some time after that, Taiwan was the center of propaganda from both sides. The CPC wanted to ""liberate"" Taiwan, while Kuomintang wanted to ""recapture the mainland."" In the 1950s, the CPC published four ""Messages to Chinese compatriots"" in Taiwan, which are considered the basis of Beijing's Taiwan policy. In these texts, Beijing warned Taiwan of collaborating with US ""imperialists."" Military confrontation, particularly artillery attacks, also continued during this time. In 1971, the United Nations General Assembly declared that the People's Republic of China was the sole lawful representative of the country. With this decision, the Republic of China (ROC)/Taiwan was removed from all UN bodies. The frustration of ROC's foreign minister, Chow Shu-kai (right), and his ambassador Liu Chieh is easy to see in this picture. The fifth and last ""message"" from Beijing to Taiwan was published on January 1, 1979. The mainland, under the leadership of the reformist Deng Xiaoping ended military operations, announced the development of bilateral ties and promised peaceful reunification. However, Beijing's right to represent China internationally was not to be questioned. The new orientation of China's Taiwan policy took place as Washington and Beijing got closer. On January 1, 1979, the US and China resumed diplomatic relations, with Washington under President Jimmy Carter recognizing Beijing as the sole legitimate government of the whole of China. The US embassy in Taiwan was remodeled into an institute for culture. Even before meeting US President Carter, Deng Xiaoping had introduced the principle of ""one country, two systems|"" which allowed Taiwan to maintain its social systems even after reunification. However, Taiwan's President Chiang Ching-Kuo did not immediately fall for it. On the contrary, in 1987 he formulated the principle of ""one China for the better system."" In 1986, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), Taiwan's first opposition party, was founded. At a meeting in 1991, the DPP declared a clause for Taiwan's independence, which stipulated that Taiwan was sovereign and not a part of China. In unofficial Hong Kong talks in 1992, representatives of Taipei and Beijing reached a political agreement on the nature of their relationship. Both parties agreed that there was only one China. However, they had different views on what ""One China"" meant. A year later, the chief negotiators Wang (left) and Koo met in Singapore. In an interview with DW in 1995, the first democratically elected President of Taiwan and the KMT leader Lee Teng-hui said that all relations beyond the straits of Taiwan would be ""defined as relations between states; at the very least, as a relationship of a special kind between states."" His formulation was very close to being a declaration of independence. The DPP won the presidential election for the first time in 2000, with Chen Shui-bian, the Taiwanese-born who had no connections to mainland China, calling for ""a state on each side."" It meant that Taiwan should have nothing to do with China anymore. In 2005, Beijing reacted with the Anti-Secession Law, which allowed the use of military force in the event that Taiwan declared independence. After losing the elections in 2000, the KMT adopted a changed formulation of the ""Consensus of 1992"" in the party's statute, which called for ""one China, different interpretations."" That is why the 1992 Consensus is still debated in Taiwan. The reason: the negotiators of 1992 did not have an official position. The mainland adopted the ""Consensus of 1992"" as a political basis for creating a relationship with Taiwan. In the first summit between the two sides since the communists came to power in China, Hu Jintao (right) and Lian Zhan endorsed the ""Consensus of 1992"" and the ""One China"" principle. After KMT's Ma Ying-Jeou won the 2008 presidential elections, both sides continued to come closer. In an interview with DW in 2009, Ma said: ""The straits of Taiwan should be a place of peace and security. We have come a lot closer to this goal. Basically our direction is correct."" After the elections in 2016, when President Tsai Ing-wen came to power, the independence movement gained a lot of wind. Tsai disputed the existence of the 1992 consensus and described the ""attempt of China to interfere in the political and social development of Taiwan"" as the ""biggest challenge.""

Wildfires have scorched swaths of Tasmania, offshore from continental Australia's Victoria state, where residents last month faced a record heat wave.

For ten days, about a million people crowd into the fairgrounds. The high point is the parade of the marksmen (pictured here). But even the anti-gun lobby can find plenty to do here - if simply partying isn't enough. The undisputed largest festival in Germany is the Oktoberfest. Every year, over six million guests come to party the Bavarian way. Most head straight to the beer tents, even lining up in the early morning hours to grab one of the coveted seats, as here in the Augustiner tent. Beer tents and brass bands aren't limited to Bavaria. North Rhine-Westphalia, too, can boast festivals that bring down the house. The biggest is the Kermess on the Rhine, with annual crowds numbering a good four million. The festival lasts ten days through the third week of July. Rides like the ferris wheel, log flumes and roller coasters are the funfair highlights. Fifty attractions and five whole kilometers of booths and concessions make up North Rhine-Westphalia's second largest festival. The Cranger Kermess in the Ruhr Valley city of Herne tallies annual guest figures of close to four million. It goes on for 10 days, starting the first Friday in August. A special feature is the horse market and show the day before opening. The Bremen Free Fair looks back on a long history. Emperor Conrad II granted Bremen the right to hold the fair in 1035, allowing farmers, craftsmen and traders to sell their wares in the town center with no special restrictions. Now, almost a millennium later, the Free Fair runs for 17 days in October and includes a procession, booths and fairground rides. As with the Bremen Free Fair, the origins of the Hamburger Dom date back to the 11th century, when traders, craftsmen and jesters set up a market in and around the Hamburg Cathedral. The original building no longer exists, but the reveling lived on and grew into a festival that draws around four million partiers three times a year: The Hamburger Dom is held in spring, summer and winter. Bavaria's neighbor Baden-Württemberg has its own big bash: The Cannstatter Volksfest, also drawing crowds of some four million every year in late September and early October. The 35-hectare fairgrounds, called the ""Wasen|"" are in Stuttgart's Bad Cannstatt quarter. King William I of Württemberg and his Russian wife Katharina launched the festival in 1818. The Kiel Week is an international sailing event and one of Germany's biggest festivals. It takes place during the last week of June in the Baltic port city, roping in some 3.5 million landlubbers every year. The climax is the windjammer parade of about 100 historical and tall ships. There are booths, rides and live shows on shore. Over 1.6 million people come together to celebrate the Libori Festival in Paderborn in late July. It's a blend of church festival, kermess, culture, performances and flea market. The celebration has its origin in the translation of the relics of Saint Liborius of Le Mans to Paderborn in the year 836 C.E. The Hamburg Port Anniversary is the world's biggest port festival with a program of events for land, sea and air. Every year in May, around 1.5 million people throng the waterfront to celebrate. Special highlights include the fireworks, ship christenings and parades. This year, the port of Hamburg turned 827 years old.

While the African National Congress (ANC) governs, the opposition grumbles. Despite impassioned campaign efforts from the liberal Democratic Alliance (DA) and the left-wing populist Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), there have certainly been no seismic shifts. The election result was as predicted:the ANC lost votes, but not as dramatically as could have been expected. But at the same time, neither the DA nor the EFF gained much from the ruling party's losses, which one may have reasonably expected. The EFF did not manage to hit a nerve as a protest party — and the DA even lost votes. In Parliament, things remain unchanged. The EFF's armchair revolutionaries in their clownish but propagandistically effective red overalls put the left under pressure while also not shying away from racist anti-white attitudes against the minority population. The 'economic freedom' that they tout in their party name is limited to redistribution and the restriction of entrepreneurial freedoms. In other words, it is socialism Venezuela-style, driven by emotions and devoid of economic expertise. Claus Stäcker heads DW's Africa department The ANC — socialist and liberal at once The DA's smooth economic liberals, on the other hand, will continue to claim to be the only party with the necessary financial know-how. They will avoid alienating entrepreneurs and white voters and thus continue to diminish the deep-seated social problems that stem from 400 years of white supremacy and arrogance. But it is precisely these issues that are still crucial to the majority of the population today. And, years after the plight of Nelson Mandela, South Africa still has not found the answers to solve these issues. Amongst all of this, a damaged and corrupt ANC, which with its concept of patriotism seeks to be both socialist and economically liberal. An ANC looking to unite irreconcilable factions within the party. It is striving to be Washington and Beijing in one, black and white at the same time, both Ramaphosa and Zuma, honest and corrupt, radical and liberal — a collective movement that is almost for impossible for voters to gauge. It is also still cashing in on its past. The ANC has until now positioned itself — with the moral high-ground displayed by many former liberation movements — as being deserving of permanently staying in government. The ANC takes for granted that voters will time and again watch the party's attempts at making internal reforms. The ANC peddles Mandela's legacy, using it to win election after election and buying time— only to squander it again. But it won't last much longer. A change in sentiment is most evident in the number of non-voters. With just over 60 %, voter turnout was the lowest of all six free elections since 1994, when the rule of the white minority ended. Young people are so disillusioned they did not even bother to go to the ballot box. Fewer than every fifth young voter exercised his or her right to vote. The apathy speaks volumes.

South Africa still lacks a dynamic, modern opposition party with the ability to reach consensus and mobilize the country's young people with both passion and pragmatism. The opposition has once again been given five years to sharpen its profile. The time for navel-gazing is over. This was the final easy win for the ANC. Party leader and President Cyril Ramaphosa scraped by with a slap on the wrist and with his anti-corruption agenda, he has again bought his party some time. But his term will be a probationary period, one granted on borrowed trust. Read more: South Africa marks 25 years since the end of apartheid It is a loan that must be repaid within five years. But it all could quickly come undone if he fails to credibly clean up the ANC and the state which have practically been one in the last 25 years. Ramaphosa will have to employ drastic measures to atone for the criminal legacies of his predecessor Jacob Zuma— even to the point of excluding him from the party. Ramaphosa must win over banks, stock exchanges and investors while stepping up efforts to bridge social divisions. If he prevails, he could go down in history as the president that won the hearts of the people. If not, he will just become known for business as usual since the ANC has long been perceived as a party of the older generation. The time has come for real alternatives, that, this time around, nine million voters did not see materialize. However, it is they who hold the future in their hands.

And, of course, there is the autobahn. Adventurous, speed-craving tourists think they can rent a car, jump in and drive without speed limits across the national highway network. What a way to travel! And they can do that — sometimes. As the German paper Süddeutsche Zeitung notes, Germany is the only European nation to not have a general speed limit. Instead, there is a speed ""recommendation"" of 130 kilometers per hour (81 mph). But there are restrictions in certain places, such as near construction sites, dangerous stretches with curves or in and around cities. According to ADAC, Germany's national automobile association, there are speed restrictions on about 40 percent of the German autobahn. Dispelling myths Why there are no limits on the other 60 percent of highways has largely to do with the power of the German automobile industry's lobby, says Thomas Harloff, author of the Süddeutsche article. Addicted to speed After all, the country is known for its fast, extremely well-engineered cars — a reputation that is a major selling point. Allowing those cars to fly across German highways without restriction ""justifies their right to exist"" in the first place, notes Harloff. Still, Harloff points out, studies show that the majority of Germans would prefer restrictions, both to cut down on accidents and fatalities, and to protect the climate from increased emissions. However, statistics show that 60 percent of all fatal accidents occur not on the autobahn, but on country roads where the maximum speed limit is 100 km/h (62 mph). So, we can dispel the myth that there are absolutely no speed limits on German freeways — and perhaps while we're at it the myth that Adolf Hitler initiated the construction of the autobahn.

The author and professor of astrophysics at the University of Zurich's Centre for Theoretical Astrophysics and Cosmology is also a musician who works with the sounds of space. DW spoke with Moore to learn more about the mythology of the Moon a half century after that first giant leap. DW: Why are people so fascinated by the Moon? Ben Moore: I think one of the main things is that it's a beautiful sight in the night sky to look out at. It's the most obvious visible thing you can see with your eye. Because it's so near, you can see features on the Moon with your eye like the gray patches which are actually ancient lava fields that are made of solidified basalt rock, and those are the features that different cultures have associated things with. The Chinese associated those features with a rabbit or hare in the Moon; in the Germanic cultures, it was often a child or a man in the Moon. Author and astrophysicst Ben Moore Why have people interpreted the Moon and seen things on its face? It goes back thousands of years before humanity understood more about the Moon. It was a sort of mythical thing and associated with the gods and with folklore that has come down through the generations. In the Germanic cultures, for example, the boy or the face of the man in the Moon was sometimes associated with a man that had been found thieving and was banished to the Moon to live there for eternity. Read More: A cinematic flight to the moon: The 'Apollo 11' documentary So it could be that by telling these stories, people were teaching or learning lessons? Yes. The emerging cultures were trying to make sense of the world around them without the knowledge that we have today. They would make up stories and I think that's how they tried to make sense of the cosmos. And you know, for example, that the first advanced civilization was the Sumerians who invented writing. They invented the wheel. This was 5,000 years ago and the Moon was the most important god for the Sumerians. They had dedicated astronomers who did nothing but watch the Moon and try and work out patterns in the Moon and when the eclipses would occur. They associated the eclipses with events that were going to happen on Earth, such as wars or famines. The astronomers would have to tell the ruling king when these were going to occur — during these events the king would sometimes put in place a fake temporary king who would suffer any bad consequences! Are there examples of those superstitions continuing in contemporary culture? It was the sort of beginnings of astrology that came from the Sumerians -- not the astrology that we have today about the planetary alignments affecting humans based on their birthdate. The Sumerian astrology was more about the omens and myths associated with the eclipses and the appearance of the Moon. With the historic moon landing on July 20, 1969, the moon could well have lost some of its mythical luster. Suddenly humans were exploring its mysteries first-hand — and even taking photographs. Science, it seemed, had finally conquered the Earth's enigmatic satellite — even its dark side. On July 27, 2018 a rare dual celestial phenomenon occurred: a relatively long lunar eclipse or ""blood moon"" due to the moon's change in color while shadowed by earth, and the nearest approach of planet Mars in 15 years. The very rare cosmic coincidence had sky gazers out in force. Since the beginning of time, however, the moon has been revered for its magic, mystery and cultural significance. People have worshipped the moon since the beginning of time, structuring their lives around its patterns and revering its perceived forces. Sometimes time was counted in moons rather than days or months. The bronze Nebra sky disc, found in Saxony-Anhalt in 1999, represents the duality of early astronomy and spirituality. The disc is estimated to be 3700-4100 years old. In the visual arts, the moon has been used to symbolize a variety of themes: innocence, the Virgin Mary, female sexuality. However, the overwhelming association has always been one of romance. Artists frequently looked to the moon for its magic, as displayed here in Caspar David Friedrich's ""Two Men Contemplating the Moon"" from 1820. The moon has played a pivotal role in literature since time immemorial. In poetry, it's often used to express melancholy and longing — or often solace, as in Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's poem ""To the Moon."" The opening verse of the poem reads: ""Bush and vale thou fill'st again / With thy misty ray / And my spirit's heavy chain / Castest far away."" The moon may inspire owls and wolves to sing, but humans have also made a habit of howling at it. Famous examples include Matthias Claudius' beloved German lullaby ""Gently the Moon has Risen|"" Elvis Presley's version of Rodgers and Hart's ""Blue Moon"" and Pink Floyd's seminal 1973 album ""The Dark Side of the Moon."" Mark Twain once said ""Everyone is a moon, and has a dark side which he never shows to anybody."" Since ancient times, legends have abounded about people who turn into wolves at the full moon. The werewolf has been a perennial cinema favorite — as in ""The Wolf Man"" of 1941, pictured. But the moon has played a role in every genre, including romantic comedies like the 1987 romcom ""Moonstruck."" But the magic of the moon wasn't destroyed by its human conquest. Indeed, it still continues to inspire, and in 2013 Chinese artist Ai Weiwei and his Danish collaborator Ólafur Elíasson launched their ""Moon"" project. At www.moonmoonmoonmoon.com people can immortalize their own drawings of the moon. ""Leave your fingerprint and see the shared moon grow as others reach out too|"" implores the website. Author: Philipp Jedicke Moving ahead a few thousand years, the Romans actually took these myths even further and Ptolemy [Editor's note: Claudius] developed his modern astrology based on the continuation of that. We still have that today. Unfortunately, it doesn't make any scientific sense whatsoever and there's no evidence astrology works at all. But it still remains with us, a remnant of the first cultures associating the Moon with affecting life on Earth. Your recently published book, The Moon: Past, Present & Future, is presented as a biography of the Moon. Why? My book is the entire story of the Moon — the history, the present day knowledge and the future of our Moon. So it's really the life story of our Moon from its origins to the end of its time. What are its effects on the Earth, and life on Earth as well, which are quite fascinating. Can you elaborate some of those effects? One of the most interesting, and which is why I started doing research on the origin of the Moon, was that without our Moon the Earth would be unstable. It would tip and tilt and wobble like a chaotic wobbling top in space and that would lead to dramatic climate change on a timescale of a few hundred thousand years. But the gravity of our Moon pulls on the bulge of our spinning Earth and keeps it spinning in place and it helps stabilize our climate throughout time, over the entire 4.5-billion-year history of the Earth. And hence its effect on life, because without that we probably all wouldn't be alive… Exactly. Evolution would have happened very differently because you can imagine life developing in the warm equator or somewhere in the oceans and all of a sudden the Earth is tipped over a bit and that becomes a frozen wasteland. So it will be hard to envisage life evolving in the same way at all. We've talked about the myth of the Moon in general, but what about the dark side of the Moon? Pink Floyd named an album after it. You've co-written a children's book about aliens on the dark side of the Moon. Why are people so obsessed with that side? I think it comes from the fact that throughout history we couldn't see the far side of the Moon and the name ""the dark side"" gives it even more appeal. Of course, it's not actually dark. It has as much sunlight as the near side but we only see the near side of the Moon because the Moon spins round exactly once in exactly one orbit around the Earth. So as mysterious as the Moon has seemed at times, how could people imagine traveling to and landing on it? The first science fiction stories in the 17th century were actually written about mythical journeys to the Moon. Authors were writing about the life that could exist on the Moon and what it must be like to stand on the Moon. Galileo himself wrote one of the very first science fiction books, and that was after the invention of the telescope because the telescope brought the surface of the Moon a bit closer. So it was those science fiction stories that stimulated the first rocket scientists like the Soviet Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, who developed the multi-stage rocket and the famous rocket equation.

Ben Moore's book was released in German in May They put huge budgets into the Apollo program and they showed superiority in space against the Soviets — that was the main goal. But culturally, there was an important secondary effect. It's the fact that humans had seen the Earth from another world. They stood on the Moon and looked at the Earth and every astronaut that walked on the Moon will always tell stories about how amazing it was to see the Earth as a whole from far away. So it sort of put our planet into perspective, as Carl Sagan [Editor's note: astrophysicist, author and TV host] said, it was ""a pale blue dot"" in a vast cosmos. You also collaborate with artists and make music yourself, which you say is inspired by dreams of space. How do you describe those dreams in your music? I try to incorporate sounds from space into my songs. Such as the sound of the Big Bang — the universe expanding. We can't hear it with our ears, but I can rescale the sound by changing the frequencies so that we can hear it on a computer. And then I can incorporate that sound — it's a whooshing noise — which I can use in the music, or the sound of a star when it explodes, which sounds like a bass-drum. Ben Moore has written several non-fiction books on the Earth, the Universe and other life forms in space. He's also co-authored a book (with wife Katharina Blansjaar) for children titled Gibt es auf der dunklen Seite vom Mond Aliens? (Are There Aliens on the Dark Side of the Moon?). His musician moniker is ""Professor Moore."" According to NASA research, the moon is slowly losing heat, which causes its surface to shrivel up like a grape turning into a raisin. But that's not all: its interior is shrinking! The moon has become about 50 meters (150 feet) ""skinnier"" over the past several hundred million years. Conspiracy theorists believe that the lunar landing was a fake, and that Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked around on July 21st, 1969, on a soundstage instead of the moon. They point to the fact that the flag planted by Aldrin waved as if moved by the wind, which would be impossible in space's vacuum. NASA's explanation: Aldrin was twisting the flagpole while planting it in the ground. If it's summer in your neck of the woods, you might be sweating right now. But just remember: temperatures are little more extreme on the moon. When the sun hits its surface, it can get up to 127 degrees Celsius (260 degrees Fahrenheit) hot. Without the warm glow, temperatures can drop down to -153 degrees Celsius (-243 degrees Fahrenheit). Brrr! The myth of a person living on the moon has existed for almost as long as Earth's satellite itself. Some people see a face on the surface of the full moon, composed of the dark lunar plains and the lighter lunar highlands. Many cultures have tales about an actual person who committed some kind of misdeed and was banished to the moon for it. Astronauts are yet to encounter them, though. The moon is drifting away from Earth at a speed of almost 4 centimeters (1.5 inches) per year. The farther away our satellite is, the smaller it appears to us. In about 550 million years, it'll look too small to ever ""cover"" all of the sun, even at its closest position to Earth. That'll mean no more total solar eclipses. Ah, howling at the moon — no old-timey scary movie is complete without it. But in fact, wolves do not intensify their howling when a full moon rolls around, and they don't direct their howls at the moon, either. They simply yowl at night, which is also the time when a full moon is most visible. That could be one reason our ancestors drew the connection. 12 humans have walked on the moon so far. While they come from various professional fields, they have a couple of things in common: All of them are American, all of them are white and all of them are men. Let's see where the first non-American on the moon will be from — maybe it'll be a woman and/or person of color, too!

The clash between Djokovic and eight-time winner Roger Federer lived up to its billing as both produced tennis of the highest quality in a five-set thriller that lasted three minutes shy of five hours on Centre Court. A pulsating first set concluded in a tie-break that had the crowd on tenterhooks. With Federer mixing up the pace, Djokovic's movement and defensive tennis drew unforced errors from the Swiss, who handed his opponent the first set after failing to land two ambitious winners inside the baseline. After neither player managed to produce a break in the first set, Federer turned things around quickly in the second and found himself two breaks up with three games played. With Djokovic's defenses not providing as stern a resistance, Federer cruised to a second set win in less than half the time of the first. Djokovic moved to within a set of a fifth Wimbledon title after fighting back from a set point down to claim the third set at the end of another tense tie break. The reigning champion was winning the more pivotal points, but Federer was arguably playing the better tennis. With the Centre Court crowd staunchly behind him though, the Swiss again fought back in the fourth, breaking Djokovic twice to take a 5-2 lead. While he was broken himself for the first time in the match when serving for the set, Federer held on at love with his second opportunity. In the first men's singles final to go to five sets since 2014, it was Djokovic who stole an advantage, capitalizing on the second of two break points to take a 4-2 lead. Federer broke back immediately, but with neither player dropping a game, an electrifying final extended to a tie break after ending 12-12 as per the rules introduced in 2019. Yet it was the two match points squandered with the game at 8-7 that came back to haunt Federer, as like in the earlier tie breaks, Djokovic moved into a commanding 6-3 lead before completing his title defence courtesy of a Federer miss hit. ""I think this was, if not the most exciting and thrilling final I've been a part of then definitely in the top two or three of my career - and against one of the greatest of all time in Roger who I respect a lot|"" Djokovic told the BBC. ""Unfortunately in these matches one player has to lose. Both of us had our chances. It was quite unreal to have match points against me and come back and then to have a tie-break at 12-12. ""I was actually hoping I could get to a tie-break. Roger said he hopes he give people the chance to believe at 37 years old and I hope that I am one of them. He inspires me that's for sure."" Clocked at four hours and 57 minutes Djokovic's win broke the Wimbledon record for the longest singles final eclipsing the 2008 final between Federer and Nadal which ended at the four hours and 48 minute mark. Djokovic is now just three men's singles titles short of equalling the record held by Federer. Wimbledon is the world's oldest tennis tournament and is held annually at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet club in Wimbledon, London. In 2009, its Centre Court was fitted with a retractable roof to lessen the loss of playing time due to rain. There are 18 courts used for the Championships (and 22 practice courts) and it takes 15 months and nine tonnes of grass seed to prepare the courts. In modern sports, where advertising dominates team kits and color is everywhere, there is something brilliant about the fact that the kits of Wimbledon players must be 90 percent white. White does not include cream or off-white, just white. Originally, it was to avoid sweat showing. Andre Agassi's wild taste was tamed in the 90s, while Roger Federer's orange-soled shoes weren't part of the code. It might look like good fun being a ball boy/girl at Wimbledon, but training for those in charge of the balls and the towels is perhaps tougher than any other tournament. The 14 to 18-year-old school children train for five months and from 700 applicants, only 250 end up on the coveted grass. The average age is 15 and most spend two years as a ball boy/girl. Apart from the green of the grass and the white of the kit, the other color often seen at Wimbledon is red. Strawberries and cream are the tournament's favorite dish. During the tournament, 28,000 kilograms of strawberries and 10,000 liters of fresh cream are eaten. Add to that the 320,000 glasses of Pimm's, 29,000 bottles of champagne and 25,000 scones then it's no surprise Wimbledon is awesome. One thing about grass that other tournaments can't offer is more remarkable shots. A 17-year-old Boris Becker made it famous when he won hearts and the Wimbledon trophy in 1985, but his famous dive carried on even after he stopped played. In 2011, Novak Djokovic and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga had an incredible rally of diving shots, while Dustin Brown did the same against Lleyton Hewitt in 2013. Both the men's and women's trophies are some of the finest in sport. The Rosewater Dish, the trophy for the women's single champion, has a mythological theme and has the Roman goddess of wisdom and strategic warfare (Minerva) etched around the rim. The champions receive a three-quarter size replica with all the previous champions engraved, as well as the $2.8 million both winners receive."|"Defending champion Novak Djokovic claimed his fifth Wimbledon title beating eight-time champion Roger Federer in a record-breaking five-set thriller.

Algeria led through a first-half own goal by William Troost-Ekong before Nigeria equalised with an Odion Ighalo penalty awarded after a lengthy VAR review.

Good behavior from Islamabad is rewarded with tariff preferences like zero duties on two-thirds of all goods under the so-called the Generalized System of Preferences, or GSP+. Since 2014, the GSP+ has given a major boost to Pakistani textile exports. The deal has also brought in foreign revenue in the face of China-driven trade imbalances. Trade with the EU has doubled and the bloc is now Pakistan's biggest export market. But these economic benefits come with an obligation to uphold the EU's democratic values.

Bhutto, the first democratically elected female head of an Islamic country, died in an attack two months later, on December 27 in the northern city of Rawalpindi. The Wah bombing was a double suicide attack on the Pakistan Ordinance Factories (POF) in Wah on August 21, 2008. At least 64 people died in the attack, which remains to date the deadliest on a military site in Pakistan's history. A spokesman from Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claimed responsibility for the attack.

"a-49600807"|"https://www.dw.com/en/un-hosts-yemeni-talks-to-break-stalemate/a-49600807"|""|"Yemen's warring sides had agreed on a ""mechanism and new measures to reinforce the ceasefire and deescalation|"" announced the UN on Monday after talks convened by former Danish general Michael Lollesgaard. Under a truce agreement reached in Stockholm last December, all factions were supposed to have withdrawn from Hodeida within two weeks. In May, Yemen's government — backed by a Saudi-led military coalition — accused Iran-aligned Houthi militias of faking pullouts staged at Hodeida and two other ports by merely handing control over to allies. On Sunday, representatives were picked up at different locations by a UN ship for the talks — the first meeting between the factions since February. The maritime encounter was confirmed by Wadah Dabish, a spokesman for Yemeni government forces. Reducing hostilities 'as soon as possible' The UN statement said both sides were keen to reduce hostilities around Hodeidah ""as soon as possible."" Still pending, said the UN, was agreement between political leaders on ""local security forces, local authority and revenues."" The UN statement did not elaborate. The UN has identified conflict as the ""root cause"" of Yemen's crises. More than 10,000 people have been killed since the conflict erupted in 2014 when Shiite Houthi rebels launched a campaign to capture the capital, Sanaa. In March 2015, a Saudi-led coalition launched a deadly campaign against the rebels, one that has been widely criticized by human rights groups for its high civilian death toll. The conflict has prevented humanitarian aid from reaching large parts of the civilian population, resulting in 60 percent of the country's 28 million people being classified as ""food insecure."" At least 2.2 million children are acutely malnourished, according to the UN World Food Program. UN chief Antonio Guterres has urged the Security Council to pressure warring parties to allow aid in. More than 2 million people have been displaced by conflict, including marginalized communities such as the ""Muhammasheen|"" a minority tribe that originally migrated from Africa. Despite the civil war, many flee conflict in Somalia and head to Yemen, marking the convergence of two major migration crises in the Middle East nation. Yemen hosts more than 255,000 Somali refugees, according to UNHCR. As of October 2017, the number of suspected cholera cases exceeded more than 750,000, and at least 2,135 people had died from the waterborne bacterial infection in Yemen in ten months, said the WHO. Although cholera can be easily treated, it can kill within hours when untreated. By October 2018, over 10,000 cases of cholera were being treated weekly. In Yemen, violence goes beyond civil conflict: It is considered a strategic front in the war on terrorism. The country serves as the operational base for al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, dubbed the ""most dangerous"" terrorist group before the rise of the ""Islamic State."" The US routinely uses drones to target al-Qaida leadership. However, civilians have often been killed in the operations. In a country paralyzed by conflict, children are one of the most at-risk groups in Yemen. More than 11 million children require humanitarian aid, according to the UN humanitarian coordination agency. The country's education system is ""on the brink of collapse|"" while children are dying of ""preventable causes like malnutrition, diarrhea and respiratory tract infections|"" the agency said in October. Despite several attempts at UN-backed peace talks, the conflict continues to rage on. Saudi Arabia has vowed to continue supporting the internationally recognized government of Yemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi. On the other hand, Houthi rebels have demanded the formation of a unity government in order to move forward on a political solution. But neither side appears ready to compromise. Author: Lewis Sanders IV UN extends observer mission At the United Nations in New York almost simultaneously on Monday the UN Security Council voted unanimously to extend its ceasefire observation mission for Hodeida by six months, until January 2020. The council's resolution called for full deployment of a contingent of observers, which was mandated for 75 staff but currently has only 20 on the ground. Last month, Houthi rebels balked at providing visas for UN observers stationed on ships off the coast. World's worst humanitarian disaster Deescalation in Hodeida should enable distribution of desperately needed food and medical aid to millions of Yemenis in what the UN has described as the world's worst humanitarian crisis. Hodeida, as Yemen's main port, is also strategically important for trade. Yemen's warfare — begun in 2015 during a Saudi-led military intervention in support of Yemen's government — had claimed at least 91,600 lives, said the armed conflict database ACLED last month.# It receives funding from the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the US State Department. Its numbers do not include victims of humanitarian deprivations caused by the war.

The case coincided with a regional Health Ministry statement that two Ebola workers were killed over the weekend by unidentified attackers near Mukulia in North Kivu province — the latest in a series of incidents in Congo's restive east hindering containment. Goma case isolated early North Kivu province governor Carly Nzanzu Kasiviata said the Goma case was ""detected at an early stage"" and isolated. He urged the city's population to ""keep calm"" and to observe hygiene measures. Goma had reportedly long set up hand-washing stations, with motorbike taxi drivers being told not to share helmets. Ebola spreads when humans touch bodily fluids or contaminated objects. Potential 'game-changer' In Geneva, Ghebreyesus said the spread to Goma was a potential ""game-changer|"" although he was ""confident"" that the city had precautions in place. But, he was reconvening the UN agency's expert committee to assess whether to declare an international emergency — a step it has avoided three times in the past. It was to be attended by representatives of DR Congo, the UK, the World Bank and other UN agencies. WHO emergencies chief Mike Ryan said response teams in DRC had identified 60 contacts, including 18 who arrived in the bus with the priest in Goma on Sunday. So far, half of them had been vaccinated, Ryan said, adding: ""Goma is a warning."" Case worrying A WHO response team member, Dr. Harouna Djingarey, quoted by Associated Press, said Goma authorities had located two buses taken by the pastor before he reached the city on Sunday. The case was worrying, said Djingarey, because Goma — near Congo's border with Rwanda — was ""the door of this region to the rest of world."" North Kivu province's outbreak since last year had also seen 700 people cured, and more than 160,000 vaccinated, according to DR Congo's Health Ministry. It is the 10th outbreak documented in Congo since 1976, when the disease was identified near the Ebola River, which gives it its name. The viral disease struck West Africa in 2014-2016, killing more than 11,300 people. ipj/ng (AP, Reuters, AFP, dpa) Send Facebook Twitter google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/3M6H7"|"A first case of Ebola arriving in Goma, Congo's eastern border hub, amounts to a potential ""game-changer|"" warns the World Health Organization.

It is one of the most secure areas of the frontier and is part of the 700 miles (1,126 kilometers) of fencing that have been completed thus far. The fight over how to secure the border has divided Republicans, who support more fencing, and Democrats, who argue that using technology is more effective. Experts estimate it would cost $15-25 billion (€13-22 billion) to fully wall off the entire southern frontier. Large swaths of the border are covered in desert, desolate and uninhabited. Many migrants try to cross these areas, where they fall victim to disorientation, dehydration and where the risk of death is high. Activists often leave water (pictured) and other supplies to help migrants survive the dangerous trek. Roughly 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) of the 1,933-mile border are covered by the snaking Rio Grande. Migrants regularly attempt to cross the river, either by swimming or on rafts. The calm appearance of the Rio Grande is deceitful, as it is a fast-moving river with dangerous currents. The US-Mexico border is considered the most transited frontier in the world. Most of the movement takes place at the various points of entry, where lawful back-and-forth traffic and asylum-seekers meet. The Matamoros-Brownsville International Bridge (pictured) is one of 44 official points of entry and the last one before the border ends at the Gulf of Mexico.

According to the UN definition, a refugee is a person who has fled violence or persecution, while migrants are those seeking a better life abroad. No one knows exactly how many people are being held in illegal camps in Libya, which is currently overrun by violence and chaos. Hyun-Ho Cha, spokesperson for Amnesty International in Berlin, said that the country's civil war has left its infrastructure crippled. Cha said this means there is hardly a difference between state-run or illegal camps, adding that armed militias often run the so-called state camps, and government authorities have very little effective control.

According to Amnesty, the already calamitous conditions in Libyan camps worsened since the outbreak of fighting in early April; those detained were caught between the warring fronts and were left without food for days. On July 3, more than 50 refugees and migrants were killed during an airstrike on the Tajoura prison camp in Tripoli. Read more: What is Turkey doing in Libya? Repatriating refugees to Libya under fire Aid organizations say the agreement reached between European Union states and Libya's coastguard to prevent people reaching Europe by boat has contributed to the dire situation of refugees in Libyan camps. After the EU rescue mission boat ""Sophia"" was suspended until further notice due to disagreements over who should receive those on board, Libyan coast guard vessels are increasingly being used — allegedly to put a stop to people smugglers. According to UN figures, more than 2,300 people have been apprehended at sea and returned to camps in Libya since January 2019. The increased use of the Libyan coast guard has also led people to choose more dangerous routes with a higher risk of drowning, said Amnesty. According to the IOM, at least 682 migrants have died crossing the Mediterranean Sea to Europe since the beginning of the year — 426 of those departed from Libya. A health system crisis is looming in Libya. Particularly the western parts of the country are running out of drinkable water. 101 of 149 conduits of the water supply system have already been destroyed in the wake of the chaotic situation in the country. Libya is mainly made up of arid desert. Under dictator Muammar Gaddafi, the 1980s saw the construction of a vast pipeline system known as the ""Great Man-Made River."" Those pipelines supply more than 70 percent of Libya's population with fresh water. However, since the fall of Gaddafi, the system has been damaged time and again. Since Gaddafi was toppled in 2011, the country has descended into chaos. The internationally recognized government in Tripoli is weak and not in control of large parts of Libya. On the other hand, renegade General Khalifa Haftar and his self-styled Libya National Army (LNA) control large areas predominantly in the east of the country. The LNA, in particular, uses the water pipeline system in order to push through its demands, thereby endangering Libya's population. In May, armed forces loyal to Haftar forced water supply employees to cut off the main water pipeline to the besieged capital, Tripoli, for two days, in a bid to press authorities to release a prisoner. It's not only the rebel groups who exploit the water supply system to push through their interests. There are also people who dismantle wellheads, in order to sell the copper those heads are made of. The United Nations have warned all sides in Libya not to use water as a weapon of war. Mostafa Omar, a UNICEF spokesman for Libya, estimates that, in future, some four million people might be deprived of access to safe drinking water if no solution to the conflict is found. This could result in an outbreak of hepatitis A, cholera, and other diarrhea illnesses. Water is not only scarce, but it's also contaminated in many areas. Bacteria or a high content of salt make it unfit for consumption. 'Often, in fact, it's no longer drinkable water,' says Badr al-Din al-Najjar, the head of Libya's National Center for Disease Control.

In their appeal, the organizations demanded that the refugees and migrants detained in Libya must be liberated and brought to safety. They also said Europeans should resume their suspended search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean and take migrants to safe havens and the possibility for migrants to make a voluntary return to their home countries should be ensured. The organizations added that more reception places under international supervision are urgently needed for those stranded in Libya, and that people should be registered and allowed to live in safe UNHCR centers.

Those formative years helped von der Leyen become fluent in English and French, in addition to her native German, and gave her confidence on the international stage. These were the characteristics the EU's 28 heads of state cited when they nominated her to become president of the European Commission earlier this month. But before von der Leyen becomes the first woman to occupy the EU's top job, she must be confirmed by a European Parliament fixated on her political missteps and frustrated with the process in which she was nominated. Family, health and defense Von der Leyen's meteoric rise in German domestic politics has led to a varied and at times controversial career. German Chancellor Angela Merkel initially tapped the mother of seven and trained physician to head Germany's Ministry of Family Affairs in 2005.

Four years later, she was named Germany's first female defense minister, a post she retained even after shaky coalition building in the wake of the 2017 elections. Few of her 17 predecessors managed to hold on to the defense portfolio for so long. On Monday, von der Leyen said she would step down as defense minister, regardless of whether she is elected European Commission president. For the most part, she has remained loyal to Merkel, who counts on her as a pillar of support both within the Cabinet and in wider policy discussions among the conservative Christian Democrats (CDU). Read more: What Ursula von der Leyen learned from Angela Merkel Moves, shakes and missteps After a career devoid of major controversy, von der Leyen's reputation took a hit while at the Ministry of Defense, long considered a graveyard for promising German politicians. Germany's military, the Bundeswehr, is known for its outdated and defective equipment, ill-conceived arms projects and severe shortage of experts. Von der Leyen managed to use her public platform and political savvy to secure an increase in German defense spending — albeit one still well below NATO spending targets — and bolster German troops for the first time since the end of the Cold War. As a result, defense policy became a recognizable element of German foreign affairs during her tenure. But scandals also plagued von der Leyen at the Defense Ministry. When right-wing extremist activities and hazing of new recruits in the Bundeswehr came to light, von der Leyen controversially distanced herself from troops by claiming they suffered from an ""attitude problem."" von der Leyen's tenure as German defense minister wasn't without controversy Meanwhile, many arms projects and modernization efforts have been severely delayed or gone way over budget, and evidence has surfaced that von der Leyen ordered a deputy minister to hire an army of pricey external consultants. A committee at Germany's parliament, the Bundestag, is currently investigating the case, with von der Leyen set to testify on the matter in a few months' time. Controversial nomination To many of von der Leyen's critics, her time at the Defense Ministry shouldn't boost her bid to succeed Jean-Claude Junker as European Commission President. ""The situation with respect to the equipment of the German armed forces is not a necessary qualification for the top EU executive job|"" Omid Nouripour, defense expert for Germany's environmentalist Greens, said at the time of her nomination. Von der Leyen's critics also contest the way in which she was nominated. She didn't stand for election as a the lead candidate of a party, in the same way as the European conservatives' Manfred Weber, or the social-democrats' Frans Timmermans. Her nomination is widely seen as the result of a backroom compromise to quash disagreement between EU heads of state. Read more: In the end, it was a backroom deal As such, a motley coalition of Green, euroskeptic and left-wing MEPs have refused to vote for her out of principle. Even European representatives from Germany's center-left Social Democrats (SPD) have threatened to tank her confirmation, despite being in a coalition government with Chancellor Merkel's CDU in Berlin. ""Support the call to reject the Council proposal for the Presidency of the Commission in the name of democracy and transparency in the EU|"" Tiemo Wölken, an MEP and member of Germany's SPD, tweeted Monday. ""No to behind-closed-door deals!"" Back to Brussels? Despite the pushback, observers maintain that the prospects of von der Leyen securing the European Commission presidency are fairly good. She is still expected to have the support of center-right and liberal MEPs, as well as about half of social-democrats. She has even managed to win over some of her critics.

Von der Leyen requires a simple majority among the European Parliament's 747 members on Tuesday to clinch the European Commission presidency. If she succeeds, it would take Merkel's trusted confidant back to Brussels in a full-circle political career."|"EU leaders threw their weight behind German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen to become the bloc's next top executive.

The 53-year-old was on stage at a charity event when the man attacked him with a knife. Right-wing groups had threatened anti-government politicians online before, but a killing in front of the eyes of the nation turned words into harrowing reality. In 2017, a nationalist youth organization had issued ""political death certificates"" for politicians, including Adamowicz. The certificates were not an isolated case: The same year, nationalists hung photos of Polish politicians on gallows. Elected officials have also fanned the flames. This April, a senator from the ruling Law and Justice party said the country should be ""purged"" of those ""not worthy of belonging to our national community."" In grief, the mayor's wife and her two daughters left Poland and traveled abroad to reflect on Pawel's death and its causes. Condolences poured in from figures such as Pope Francis. Magdalena Adamowicz came back with an idea for a campaign. She called it ""Imagine There's No Hate"" and began with an open letter to her country's political, religious and civic leaders, appealing to them to raise their voices against hatred. Pawel Adamowicz was elected mayor just two months before he was killed ""I can sit between four walls and cry in silence or shout, but nobody will hear this|"" Adamowicz tells DW. ""So I thought about what to do to avoid this [violence] in the future. To protect other people from suffering like we did."" The 46-year-old, who wears a campaign T-shirt with a red heart on it and a matching red belt, strives to build an ""international coalition against hate speech."" This spring, she met US Congress members, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and Google executives to demand action against hate speech and fake news. A lawyer and lecturer at the University of Gdansk, Adamowicz had never regarded herself as a politician, but friends convinced her to run for European Parliament in May. She won a seat with nearly 200,000 votes from her home region of Pomerania, where Gdansk is located. In Brussels, the new Polish MEP has found the political platform to pursue one of her main goals: an EU-wide law against hate speech, penalizing both the individual and the platform that publishes incendiary messages. She doesn't believe fighting the phenomenon on a national level is enough: ""It has no borders […], it's like air pollution."" Read more: Germany implements new internet hate speech crackdown Hate speech and the threats posed by disinformation were also the main topics of her election campaign. Adamowicz is convinced her subject is of existential importance to society. Pawel Adamowicz's murder rallied many Poles to speak up against hate ""We are not afraid of tanks or being attacked by aerial bombing. But what can really destroy us is this|"" she says. She points to the UK and the US, saying bots perverted the Brexit referendum and the US presidential elections in 2016. Poland A and Poland B Like in the UK and the US, in Poland polarized public debate and coarsened discourse have split the country. Two camps, ""Poland A"" and ""Poland B|"" are consumed by mutual animosity, according to Ania Skrzypek, senior research fellow at the Foundation for European Progressive Studies think tank. That is: the cities vs. the countryside, the liberal West vs. the conservative East. The rift ""manifests itself in so many ways, including the television that is being watched|"" Skrzypek says. ""In the countryside you get to see the [public broadcaster's] channel 1, and their portrait of Poland is a totally different one"" compared to what more liberal media show. The message on TVP1, the main public channel, which is supportive of the current conservative government, is ""very bold, anti-liberal, anti-civil liberties|"" Skrzypek says. Some called for the resignation of TVP's chairman after Adamowicz was killed Liberal media, however, are divisive in their own way, she says. Though more subtle, they still cater mostly to one group, people who feel others ""should somehow be detested for choosing the Law and Justice [party]."" Polarization is not confined to the airwaves. In the Polish parliament, Skrzypek says, ""this antagonism is allowing the idea that you could go violent in the streets [… and it is] a very striking and shocking one."" But the deterioration of political language and behavior doesn't stop there. Recently Jaroslaw Kaczynski, chairman of the Law and Justice party, branded anti-government protesters as ""national traitors"" and called the LGBTQ+ rights movement a threat to the Polish nation. Before a Pride parade in Warsaw, a public TV journalist tweeted that ""one must shoot at LGBT people|"" adding ""not in the literal sense of course."" Read more: Poland: Furor over 'rainbow madonna' LGBT activist arrest Blatant anti-Semitism is also a problem on Polish message boards. As Poland heads for parliamentary elections in the autumn, Ania Skrzypek believes the campaign will be ""very, very divisive."" Nonetheless, Skrzypek says ""we should not give up on Poles."" She points out that people still turn out for elections and engage in progressive civic movements. ""There is still enough [energy] in society to have a spirit of resistance when things go too far."" 'I give a lot of hugs' Despite being a visible figure in this resistance, Adamowicz does not receive many hateful comments. Instead, people whom she meets on the streets while campaigning often approach her for a hug. A giant heart-shaped card she uses at events has become a backdrop for group photos with sympathizers. Even though Adamowicz is still mourning her murdered husband, there is no bitterness in her message. She wants to protect all victims of hateful rhetoric and disinformation. In her eyes, the killer is also a victim. People who have been ""indoctrinated with disinformation"" should get help before they commit violence, she says. ""My husband really loved The Beatles, and my older daughter does|"" Adamowicz says. ""So we took [our slogan] from John Lennon's 'Imagine' and made up 'Imagine There's No Hate.'""

Grace Meng: There were definitely reports of people having agents come to their door, but they didn't open, because the agents didn't have warrants. There were some rumors of ICE activity at subways in New York City, but they turned out to be false. It seems like, at least for the weekend, the raids did not happen as communities feared. But there was still an enormous impact. People were afraid and chose not to do things that they would otherwise have done. And this is really just one day in what it's like to be an immigrant living under Trump. Why do you think the large-scale raids did not happen? Meng: We are deeply concerned by the announced raids Government officials who told media that these raids were going to start on Sunday also said they were going to happen over the course of a week, so we can't assume that they have been called off yet. They may still happen. There were also reports that officials said they had lost the element of surprise by having the raids announced in advance. So they may have decided not to start on Sunday, since they expected so many people to be in hiding. What do you expect for this week? I expect that people in hiding will continue to stay in hiding, that more people will forego taking their children to school or to medical care, that they'll make their activity outside their home as minimal as possible. Certainly the intensity of fear that people are feeling right now is directly a result of the announced raids. But the general fear, the general decisions not to call the police when they're victims of crimes, not to seek medical care — those decisions have been made by immigrants fearful of deportation for a long time, not just this week. What is your stance on these raids? We are deeply concerned about the tremendous human rights abuses that flow from those massive raids as announced. If they were to arrest thousands of families, we would expect to see a cascade of such abuses: more family separation, more family detention. We would expect to see people suffering after already having gone through an immigration court process that often doesn't provide a fair hearing. And as I mentioned, we would see people foregoing necessary, important services, including for children who are US citizens. The right to education is a really basic one that applies to all children, no matter what their status. Parents have chosen not to put their kids in school. This has happened in the past and I expect it to happen in the future. That has a real impact on those children.

There is a new asylum regulation to go into effect on Tuesday stating that immigrants who have passed through another country on their way to the US are not eligible to apply for asylum in the US anymore. That would mean you'd have to either be from Mexico or Canada, or fly directly to the US to be eligible. What do you make of that? We are deeply concerned about the abuses we expect will happen if [Mexican authorities] focus on stopping Central American migrants from reaching the US. The US has an obligation, under its own laws and under international law, to receive asylum applicants and to effectively ensure that they get a fair hearing. The countries in the region through which migrants often travel do not necessarily have adequate protection for asylum seekers. The US is not to push asylum seekers to other countries. That does not absolve the US of its obligations to protect them under international law. I have met people who fled their countries because they were interpreters for the US military and traveled through Central America and Mexico [to apply for asylum in the US]. When they are fleeing persecution, they often don't get a visa to conveniently go to the place they want to get to.

But it has now become a bet of sorts waged by some UK politicians to see who, London or Brussels, blinks first. Read more: UK hopes trade deal with US could soften Brexit blow If you've ever wondered how ostensibly rational UK politicians could sanction such irresponsibility, we offer a story that may help explain. Our story begins when Bloomberg published a report last year. Three of the agency's journalists noticed, as had others, correlations between fluctuations in the price of the pound on foreign exchange markets on the night of June 23-24, 2016 (referendum night), and the public comments made by lead leaver in the campaign, Nigel Farage, on the same night. Cam Simpson, investigations editor for Bloomberg, who headed the investigation, told DW that the probe exposed how a handful of powerful financiers bought access to secret, live-streaming exit polls on the day of the Brexit vote in 2016. ""To UK lawmakers and regulators with oversight, the episode raised serious questions about insider dealing or market abuse as defined under UK and EU rules|"" Simpson said. 'Ridiculous,' 'risible' and 'dishonest' A spokesperson for the Brexit Party, when asked about the report, told DW that none of the Bloomberg allegations had been proven. ""Don't be ridiculous. That is almost accusing Mr Farage of criminal activity|"" the spokesperson said. Most of the claims were debunked and there is nothing to add to what was said at that time, the spokesperson went on. ""The idea that there was any attempt to say anything other than how things looked at the time is both risible and I would suggest dishonest|"" the spokesperson added. The facts, as we know them It is 9.40 p.m. UK time, June 23, 2016, and Farage is waiting to appear on Sky News' referendum special when, according to the Bloomberg report, he gets a call from a pal in the polling industry. A certain Damian Lyons Lowe, whose company Survation knows already from private polling data that Leave is likely to win the referendum, tells him such. Lyons Lowe's poll contradicts all other polls on offer to the public at the time, Bloomberg alleges. It is 20 minutes before the polling booths close. The Bloomberg trio note books by leave campaign financier Arron Banks and journalist Tim Shipman that put Farage in receipt of such knowledge, from ""an unidentified, financial services exit poll|"" 20 minutes before polls closed. Farage denies this. At 10 p.m. Sky News' Adam Boulton says the polls have closed and moments later announces a ""huge"" exclusive: Farage has seemingly conceded defeat. Bloomberg sends a series of headlines to its 300,000 financial clients around the world. At 10:52 p.m., the pound goes above $1.50 (€1.30), its highest value in six months, as markets breathe a sigh of relief. At 11.15 p.m., Farage gives a further concession to the Associated Press, in which he cites a financial firm's exit poll as his reason for conceding. The pound stays firm over $1.50. At 12:16 a.m., Sunderland votes for Leave and the pound plummets one minute later, hitting $1.43. At 5:28 a.m., the pound bottoms out at $1.32. sterling has fallen 10% against the dollar. Does a bad penny always turn up? Some hedge funds cashed in by shorting the pound, a practice of selling shares you don't own in the hope of buying them back at a cheaper price in the future, thus generating a profit. The main vehicle to do this is derivatives, which allow traders to benefit from even small market moves, as the market is often illiquid. Derivatives are priced to reflect market mood, so Remain sentiment after Sky's opening made short bets cheap and fueled demand.

But, he added, this was after Sky had put his statement on the air at just after 10 p.m. ""That would have been — for he and I to have spoken ahead of that 10 o'clock — would have been wrong at every level. Wrong for me, wrong for him, just would have been wrong|"" Farage said. Farage later said the news had come not from Lyons Lowe personally, but from someone affiliated with Survation's operations. He also said he had not given a formal concession. Farage now rubbishes the idea that his ""concessions"" were aimed at moving the markets. ""This is a crackpot lunatic conspiracy theory|"" he said.

""And it could happen again|"" said Foulkes, who was head of the House of Lords' select committee that investigated the allegations of collusion. The investigation found insufficient evidence to prove collusion. ""I wrote to the Metropolitan Police asking them to investigate, but they replied saying it was a matter for the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), but they seem to have done nothing about it.

""The volatility of UK politics has created volatility in its markets|"" he said.

The economy grew 6.2% over a year ago, down from the previous quarter's 6.4%, government data showed Monday. The slump came even as June factory output and retail sales pointed toward a recovery. There are expectations that Beijing may be forced to inject more capital into the economy, even if it means adding to its already ballooning debt. Many economists argue that the stimulus measures, including tax breaks for businesses, announced in March were falling short. DW spoke to Wang Tao, the chief China economist at UBS, a Swiss investment bank, to help interpret the latest set of data. DW: China's growth rate in the second quarter was the slowest in decades. Why do you think China is struggling to stimulate its economy? Wang Tao: China's growth has slowed from the first quarter to 6.2% in the second quarter. I would actually say that this is A) in line with expectation and B) that is still very good growth considering the external shock and domestic weakness. I wouldn't put it in a general 'this is the slowest in decades,' because compared to 30 years ago or 25 years ago when China had slower growth, the size of the economy of course was much smaller and the stage of development was also very different. For a $13-trillion economy growing at 6.2%, China is still contributing a third to global growth. So I wouldn't paint this as a very weak story somehow. Is it just trade tensions with the US or is there more to it? Well, compared to last year, I think it's the trade tension and therefore weaker exports. But also the trade war-related uncertainty hurts business investment and business sentiment. And on top of that domestic automobile sales have been very weak in the past 12 months or so. I think it's the slowdown in property, the slowdown in auto financing and also the end of the previous policies. All of these are factors as well. So there are domestic reasons as well. But the trade war and related uncertainty is certainly the biggest factor. Send Facebook Twitter google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/3M5ML Many say that the stimulus measures that China announced in March, including tax cuts, are falling short. How do you see that? I think if the objective of the stimulus is to stabilize the economy, it's doing fine. Growth is stabilizing. This year's growth target is 6-6.5%. So far the first half is 6.3%. We expect growth to slow further in the second half and stabilize at 6.2%. And another point, especially from maybe Germany or Europe's point of view, this Chinese stimulus may not have as big a spillover effect on the rest of the world because the tax cuts have been more focused on supporting domestic demand and this stimulus is not accompanied by a big property boost as in the past. Do you think there is a scope for more stimulus? What are the measures that China can adopt? There is scope for more stimulus. China still has space for more fiscal easing and more monetary easing. But I think at this moment in our baseline, which we assume that trade war will not escalate further, we don't really expect the government to adopt major new stimulus. We think they will fine tune the current policies to keep growth stable for this year. And growth stabilizing above 6% is enough. They don't need to do more. I mean they can do more, but there are negative consequences. For example, that will push up debt levels even higher. That is not so desirable. Read more: Will China's high debt levels spark a financial crisis? Is this something that is holding back China, the fact that more stimulus could push up debt levels? In terms of China's potential growth, long-term growth is coming down because China has become more developed than 25 years ago. And the population is aging. So long-term potential growth is about 6% at the moment and it's going down to 5% over the next few years. If they do that, that means they are going to put policy support into areas that may not be so productive and that pushes up debt levels and makes things unsustainable. That jeopardizes financial sector stability and so that is not desirable. What's your expectation from the Chinese economy in the second half of the year? In the second half, we expect stabilization at 6.1%, a bit further slowdown compared to now because the higher tariffs that were put on since May should still have more negative effect coming through. The government will continue to ease marginally further but that's going to be offset by additional downward pressure from the external side and it will affect business sentiment, investments and consumers as well. If you put all this together, we still expect growth to be at 6.1% in the second half and for growth overall for this year at 6.2%.

From today's data, you can see that quite a few data points have surprised on the upside — the industrial production, retail sales, auto sales and property investment. Not to say, that they are necessarily sustainable. One thing that I think is positive is that the Chinese consumers remain resilient especially outside of the automobile sector. And the labor market has been resilient despite the external shock. The unemployment rate has gone up a little bit but not as much as feared earlier. That helps to explain the resilience in consumer spending. The second area that's positive is not necessarily reflected in growth numbers, but the fact that despite the external shock and the trade war negotiations, the authorities have chosen to continue to open up domestic markets further, cutting tax and fees for corporations and making it easier for the private sector to borrow funds. I think all of these measures should help sustain growth in the longer term. What does this latest set of data mean for China in the ongoing trade negotiations with the US? Do you think China's position has been weakened or strengthened? I don't think one can just look at one month of data to say that has an important bearing on the trade negotiations. I doubt that's how things really work. In general, I think China has faced negative shocks from the US-China trade dispute. Because China exports more to US than the other way around and because it depends more on exports in general, the negative impact on China will be bigger than on the US. That's just the reality. So China needs to stimulate and support its domestic economy to keep growth stable, which it has done. I don't think that today's data has changed that.

"a-49596058"|"https://www.dw.com/en/galileo-satellite-navigation-system-out-of-action/a-49596058"|"Fabian Schmidt"|"Since July 11, the regular functions of the European satellite navigation system Galileo have no longer been available to users. The European Global Navigation Satellite Systems Agency (GSA) in Prague informed its customers of the failure. Use at your own risk The GSA warns that there is a ""degradation on all Galileo satellites"" and that ""the signals may not be available nor meet the minimum performance levels"" promised by Galileo. Customers who nevertheless continue to use devices that calculate their position using Galileo satellites would do so at their ""own risk."" In a further communication on July 14, the GSA added that the cause of the breakdown was to be found in ground-based infrastructure and not in the satellites themselves. 'Search and Rescue' still works The Search and Rescue (SAR) function, with which ships in distress at sea or injured mountaineers can call for help, continues to function undisturbed, the operating company says. GSA did not comment on the technical cause of the failure, but the company has set up a an ""Anomaly Review Board"" to discover the error. Read more: Post-Brexit UK won't use EU Galileo satellite system, British PM says Galileo will be fully operational, once it has 30 satellites working in orbit. Galileo behind schedule and over budget Currently, the GSA only offers initial services from Galileo, meaning navigation signals only come from 26 satellites. Once 30 Galileo satellites are in their final orbit and fully deployed by 2020, the European satellite navigation system will go into regular operation. Send Facebook Twitter google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/1G0lo This means the European Union's prestigious project is well behind schedule. Initially, Galileo was supposed to be fully operational by 2008. In terms of costs, the EU was also unable to stick to its original plans. In 1999, it had budgeted between 2.2 and 2.9 billion euros for the construction of the system, whereas the EU budget now provides for 7.2 billion euros to be spent on the construction of the system by 2020 — plus a further 3 billion euros for its operation. Better plan for redundancy This failure highlights the vulnerability and risks of satellite navigation systems. Galileo and the Global Positioning System (GPS) in the US, both of which are constantly being upgraded, are to assume important tasks in the field of autonomous driving, flying and shipping in the future. However, if autonomous vehicles, aircraft and ships are dependent on only one navigation system at a time, this could lead to a loss of control in the event of a failure. Many receivers are therefore designed to evaluate signals from several satellite providers, such as Galileo, GPS and Russia's Glonass. More complex systems also use additional locating signals from terrestrial radio systems, such as mobile phone transmitters. This makes them more reliable and less susceptible to interference. Autonomous vehicles also have radar — and often, additional optical sensors — to ensure that there is no sudden collision in the case of incorrect or missing satellite data. Read more: Four more Galileo satellites enter space Before satellites were first launched into space in the mid-20th century, we knew very little about the dynamics of our climate. Today, numerous satellites collect information which helps us piece together the story of our changing planet. In 1985, they helped discover the hole in the ozone layer, and data from space remains key to tackling global warming. Some satellites monitor signs of climate change, such as melting ice caps, rising sea levels and amounts of CO2 in the atmosphere. The Jason-3 satellite (pictured), launched in 2016, can make precise measurements of global sea levels, a key indicator of climate change. The data will give us a stronger understanding of just how our oceans are being affected by increased temperatures. Space technology has paved the way for the development of increasingly sophisticated surveying and monitoring tools which can track everything from deforestation to illegal fishing ships and even oil spills. This way, researchers know exactly when and where environmental — and legal — action needs to be taken. Satellites play a vital role in tracking natural disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires and floods. As well as providing an early warning for those on the ground, they also help authorities track the intensity of the event and understand the scale of the devastation. Monitoring storm systems helps generate better climate models to predict future disasters. Growing plants in space has already taught us valuable lessons which can be applied to sustainable agriculture on Earth. Astronauts on the International Space Station have discovered they can use less water to grow vegetables, and China recently made history by germinating a cotton seed on the far side of the moon. As our planet warms, this knowledge could be vital for farmers. Unfortunately, space technology has also had a negative impact on the environment. Every time a rocket is launched it produces a plume of exhaust smoke filled with bits of soot and a chemical called alumina, which can build up in the stratosphere and deplete the ozone. Space agencies are looking to lessen their use of ""ozone-depleting substances"" and are researching more eco-friendly fuels. There are currently more than 20,000 trackable pieces of space junk in orbit around Earth, including everything from old rockets to bolts and screws. They're not technically part of Earth's ecosphere, but if we're not careful the junk may become so dense that satellites won't be able to function properly and provide us with the data we so desperately need.

After a decade of progress, the number of people starving has risen over the last three years, the UN said in its latest report on food security: 820 million people suffer from chronic hunger, including 149 million children under the age of five who are stunted due to lack of food. There are 96 million people for whom ""we must provide food — or access to food — so people don't die|"" said Cindy Holleman, one of the main authors of the UN report. The authors estimate that around two billion people worldwide do not have sufficient access to clean and nutritious food. In every continent, a greater proportion of women struggle with food insecurity than men. Eight percent of the population in Europe and North America are hit by food insecurity. Most of the world's chronic hungry, who don't have enough food — healthy or not — live in Asia (500 million), with about half as many in Africa (260 million), particularly sub-Saharan Africa. ""Inequalities are actually rising in more than half the countries in the world|"" said Holleman. ""Hunger is worse when inequality is high."" According to the recently published ""World Wealth Report"", there are about 18 million people in the world who own at least one million dollars. Where income and arable land are unequally distributed, famines can even occur in middle income countries such as Nigeria and Iraq. Not everybody who suffers from malnutrition is thin, says Holleman. ""We're starting to see now that we have a greater link between food insecurity and overweight and obesity|"" said Holleman. Two billion people are estimated to be overweight. Unhealthy food is usually cheaper, she said. The report identifies three main reasons for lack of access to food: conflict, climate change and a weak economy. Fighting worsens hunger From looting by government soldiers to militias in South Sudan or the Democratic Republic of Congo, war and armed conflict are the main causes of hunger. Since the beginning of the war in Yemen in 2015 around 3.6 million people have been displaced. ""Nearly four years of conflict and severe economic decline are driving the country to the brink of famine and exacerbating needs in all sectors|"" says Federica D'Andreagovanni, who works for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Yemen. In war zones, the supply of the most basic goods collapses as it becomes harder to cultivate fields or run shops. ""Humanitarian conditions in Yemen are worsening at a nearly unprecedented rate."" Zimbabwe's economic crisis leaves citizens struggling for basic goods Import and export Zimbabwe is experiencing a severe economic crisis as its currency depreciates: goods becoming more expensive, salaries no longer being paid, imports drying up. In front of petrol stations, cars queue for hours. ""Fuel remains difficult to access|"" said Nathan Hayes of the Economist Intelligence Unit analysis agency. ""There are major shortages of bread, as domestic maize production has been decimated and the country cannot afford to pay for imports."" Around two million people in Zimbabwe do not have sufficient access to food. ""The depreciation of the currency… affects prices, which can affect people's access to food, income and employment|"" Holleman told DW. ""And Zimbabwe is an extreme case."" In Nigeria, five million people lack enough nutritious food. The oil-dependent export economy has suffered from low oil prices. Here, too, inflation has pushed food prices higher. The report found 65 of the 77 countries where slower economic growth has led to food shortages are dependent on exports — often oil, minerals — and imports. Countries need to diversify and transform their economies, said Holleman, so that they become less dependent on imports and exports, and to make ""rural areas and urban economies provide more sustainable alternatives to livelihoods"". Droughts are becoming more frequent in Kenya Climate change and food security In Zimbabwe, the economy will shrink due to the devastating destruction of the drought and Cyclone Idai, said Hayes. Weather extremes caused by climate change have already hit harvests and food supplies around the world. ""The long rain season is normally from March till end of May|"" said Peter Abiya Ochola of the National Drought Management Authority in Kenya. ""This year, for example we had very poor rain season. It started late in April and lasted just three weeks with some little rain showers."" Drought years are becoming more common in Kenya. Whereas droughts used to occur every five years, said Ochola, today they occur every one to two years. ""The impact on food security is bad|"" said Ochola, who estimates 1.5 million people in Kenya are affected by drought this year — particularly farmers whose fields or livestock depend on rain. To eradicate hunger, the United Nations report calls for international agreements that create peace and sustainable economic transformation so that developing countries can better prepare themselves for the causes of hunger. There was a time when hippos and elephants lived in the Sahara. Today it's a barren landscape where few creatures can survive. A small lake fed by groundwater that fell to earth as rain thousands of years ago, serves to remind of times gone by. As the climate in the region changed, it led to the creation of a vast sandscape. Deserts are still forming today — often as a result of human activity. ""Desertification"" describes the transistion of fertile land to desert. It is often connected to human behavior. When people deplete natural resources — like water sources — in areas with a dry climate, plant life disappears and the soil becomes infertile. This phenomenon can be seen in 70% of the world's arid regions, such as in India, as pictured. Every year, about 70,000 square kilometres (27,000 square miles) of desert are created. That’s equivalent to the size of Ireland. According to the German development agency, GIZ, 40% of Africa's population live in areas threatened by desertification. In Asia and South America it is 39% and 30% respectively. But places such as Germany, the US and Spain are also at risk. One reason for the proliferation of deserts is population growth. In China, for example, the soil is being used to feed more and more people. Farmers crowd their pastures with animals that eat every last plant. The soil is loosened and eventually eroded by wind and rain. This creates some 2,500 square kilometers (965 square miles) of desert in the country every year. The Aral Sea on the border between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan illustrates a failed agricultural policy that led to desertification. In the past, the Aral Sea was the fourth largest lake in the world; today there is little left of it. Since Soviet times, the two neighboring countries have tapped the lake to irrigate cotton fields. Fishing boats are now stranded on land. European countries can also suffer from cracked soil and dried up waterways. In Spain, desertification is accelerating — triggered by the demand to accomodate an influx of tourists from all over the world. Whole forests are often cleared for the construction of hotels. The soil is disrupted and removed, or buried under concrete. The Guadalajara region near Madrid is particularly under threat. Desertification greatly affects lives. Without reliable sources of water and fertile soil, people struggle to survive and often have to leave places they've lived for generations. The GIZ estimates that desertification affects 485 million people in Africa. The UN predicts that more than 60 million people will have been forced to leave the desert regions of Africa by 2020. Some countries have declared war on desertification. For decades, China has been trying to counter this trend by reforesting. Its ""Great Green Wall"" project, which began in 1978, has an ambitious goal — to replenish an area the size of Germany by 2050. On the World Day to Combat Desertification, the United Nations wants to draw attention to this increasingly urgent problem.

German-Moroccan Mariam Ktiri was one of those stuck in it after reaching the summit of the highest mountain on earth at 2:35 a.m. local time. ""Shortly below the summit, the masses ascended towards us. Many of the people were extremely slow. You could see that they were completely exhausted. It took us about an hour and a half to get below the Hillary Step|"" she told DW. For an hour and a half, Ktiri was stuck in the so-called ""death zone"" where humans can't survive long due to how thin the air is. ""Thank God I still had enough oxygen. My Sherpa was constantly checking. At that moment I wished there was policing to stop the people and say: 'Wait until those on their descent have climbed down! Everything else makes no sense.'"" Clueless climbers a risk to all Her sense of accomplishment soon gave way to feelings of disillusionment and frustration as she got caught up in the congestion, despite setting off four hours earlier than planned. ""I thought: We set off so early, we didn't even make real breaks|"" said Ktiri. ""We simply climbed up the mountain in a concentrated manner to avoid this situation. And now on the way back, we were confronted with it. I was angry that people don't think rationally. I tried to signal to those who were coming towards me: Please wait! But they didn't react."" According to Ktiri, the main problem on Everest is those with a lack of climbing experience: ""There were some who didn't have a clue. I saw people being dragged by their Sherpas on a short rope as far back as the Khumbu Icefall. If someone can't walk by himself at this point, he is entirely out of place and should turn back."" May 22, 2019: A dangerous traffic jam forms at the summit of Mount Everest She hopes that the operators will introduce performance tests to check their clients' mountaineering skills. ""The people without a clue are a risk for everyone: for themselves — okay, that's their problem – but also for the others."" According to official estimates, 300 people reached Everest's summit on May 22, a record for a single day. It was a record-breaking spring season in 2019 with around 900 successful summits, though 11 lost their lives in the attempt. Lhotse attached One day after reaching Everest's summit, Ktiri scaled Lhotse with her Sherpa. ""I'm so glad I climbed Lhotse too|"" says Ktiri: ""It was like a reward after the frustration at the traffic jam on Everest. On Lhotse on May 23, there were maybe a dozen mountaineers on the route. That was simply beautiful – apart from the corpse, which sits a few meters below the summit."" Climbers are regularly confronted with deaths on these peaks and, on the Lhotse flank, Ktiri had passed the body of Bulgarian Ivan Tomov, who had passed away during his descent a few days earlier due to a high-altitude cerebral edema. Ktiri at the summit of Moun Everest ""It looked as if he was looking at the landscape. I was shocked."" The feeling intensified later when she passed a group of Sherpas carrying a corpse down. ""After that I became quite slow."" Despite the psychological upset, she didn't think about turning back, says Ktiri. She was focused on her big goal. Seven Summits within 12 months By reaching the summit at Everest, which sits 8,850 meters (29,029 feet) above sea level, Ktiri completed her collection of the ""Seven Summits"" — the highest mountains each continent has to offer — and all within a year. Before Everest, Asia's tallest peak, she had scaled Denali (North America, 6,194 meters, 28 May 2018), Elbrus (Europe, 5,642 meters, 13 August 2018), Kilimanjaro (Africa, 5,895 meters, 24 September 2018), Mount Vinson (Antarctica, 4,897 meters, 16 December 2018), Aconcagua (South America, 6,962 meters, 12 January 2019) and the Carstensz Pyramid (Oceania, 4,884 meters, 23 February 2019). Ktiri grew up in the Moroccan city of Casablanca before moving to Augsburg, Germany when she was 18 to study and possesses both Moroccan and German citizenship. ""I identify with both countries|"" she said. ""One is my home, the other my adoptive country."" The management consultant then lived in Munich for 12 years. There she discovered her passion for mountaineering. ""What do you do in Munich? You go into the mountains|"" said Ktiri. ""Over time, my ambitions have grown."" At the end of 2018, she moved to Bern, Switzerland: ""Here the mountains are more nearby and higher. That was simply more efficient for acclimatization."" ""Have big dreams"" Encouraging Arab women The Seven Summits were ""the project of my life until now"" says Ktiri. ""Mentally, it made me very, very strong. I proved: If you have a goal in mind and you concentrate on it, and above all follow it with discipline, you will always find a way to achieve it. This applies not only to the mountains, but also to your private or professional life.""

Social hostilities involving religion, including violence and harassment by private individuals, organizations or groups, have also risen since 2007. Researchers used published information from official, NGO and religious agencies to compile their report with results updated to 2017. They found that 52 governments impose high levels of restrictions on religion, up from 40 governments in 2007. They include Russia and China. The lowest levels of restriction were in South Africa, Japan, the Philippines, Brazil and South Korea. There were 56 countries in 2017 which were experiencing social hostilities involving religion, up from 39 in 2007. Berlin's Khadija mosque European focus The most significant increase for the 2007-2017 period was in Europe, where 20 countries placed restrictions on religious dress, including burqas and face veils worn by some Muslim women. This was the case for just 5 countries in 2007. Austria has imposed a ban on full-face veils in public spaces. Germany has banned face veils for anyone driving a motor vehicle or working in the civil service while some municipal governors in Spain have introduced bans on burqas and veils.

"a-48585334"|"https://www.dw.com/en/cyprus-gas-discoveries-spark-us-russian-gamesmanship/a-48585334"|"Diego Cupolo (Nicosia, Cyprus)"|"In recent years, energy companies have discovered a number of significant gas reserves in the Eastern Mediterranean, and the rush to develop the offshore resources is reshaping the region's political and economic dynamics. Earlier this year, ExxonMobil, together with Qatar Petroleum, found the third large gas reservoir off the coast of Cyprus. Known as the Glaucus-1 field, this latest discovery will add to the inventory of Eastern Mediterranean gas reservoirs coming online in neighboring Israeli and Egyptian territorial waters, which are expected to form a new energy hub for regional and, possibly, export markets. At the same time, officials in Washington are increasingly expressing support for cooperation between Israel, Cyprus and Greece in developing the reserves as a measure to counter both growing Russian influence in the Eastern Mediterranean, and also Turkish hostility towards gas development in Cyprus' territorial waters, where both have claims to energy resources. The move signifies the return of direct US involvement in a region, where it has been largely absent in recent years as Russia strengthened its positions on the Syrian coast. Some officials in Washington and Europe also see the development of Eastern Mediterranean gas fields as a potential alternative energy source to Russian gas imports, through what is being called the East Med pipeline, which would run from Israel and Egypt through Cyprus, Greece and then onward to Italian and European markets.

Troubled US-Turkey relations In a show of support, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with Israeli, Greek and Cypriot leaders in March to discuss regional energy development and joint security initiatives. In April, US Senators Bob Menendez and Marco Rubio introduced the Eastern Mediterranean Security and Partnership Act, which would lift a decades-old arms embargo on Cyprus, as well as establish a ""United States-Eastern Mediterranean Energy Center to facilitate energy cooperation between the US, Israel, Greece, and Cyprus."" The legislation is one of two bills introduced in the US Congress this year aiming to stop the transfer of the NATO coalition F-35 warplanes to Turkey, until officials in Ankara end negotiations to purchase the Russian S-400 missile defense system, which US officials say pose a threat to NATO defenses in Turkey, a NATO member. The missile purchase is the latest in a long list of grievances that have aggravated US-Turkey relations. Much to the dismay of Ankara, Turkey has been left out of plans to develop Eastern Mediterranean gas and East Med pipeline proposals circumvent Turkish territory, excluding the country from the potential energy source and its economic benefits. ""Gas from Cyprus could have a meaning only if it contributes to the solution of the Cyprus problem|"" says Kizilyürek Niyazi Kızılyürek, a Turkish Cypriot candidate for the European Parliament with Cyprus' Progressive Party of Working People, said the isolation of Turkey could complicate future reunification efforts in Cyprus, where the northern third of the island has been occupied by Turkish troops since 1974. ""The way Israel is cooperating with the Republic of Cyprus in this field, in a way excluding Turkey from gas and energy policies, is something that won't help us solve the problem|"" Kızılyürek told DW. ""Gas from Cyprus could have a meaning only if it contributes to the solution of the Cyprus problem."" Gas revenues and a divided island Officials in northern Cyprus have claimed gas revenue from offshore developments must be shared between the Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots as they are both heirs to the island's territorial resources. Yet Greek Cypriot leaders have proposed sharing revenues only if progress is made on reunification talks, which some Turkish Cypriots view as unfair. Savas Toksoz, a general coordinator for the People's Party in northern Cyprus, said Turkish Cypriot leaders are open to discussions with US officials regarding gas development in the region, but must balance their interests with allies in Ankara. ""As Turkish Cypriots, we try to protect our rights and stand by our rights with help from Turkey, but that doesn't mean we are closed to alliance with the US|"" Toksoz told DW. ""The US stance [towards us] depends on its relations with Turkey. The better it goes for US-Turkey relations, the better it is for us."" Levent is worried about potential Turkish incitement While some analyst have said gas development could help advance a resolution between Greek and Turkish Cypriots, Sener Levent, editor-in-chief of Afrika, an opposition newspaper in northern Cyprus, said he fears gas revenues could provoke more tensions in the country. ""What I'm afraid of is the 40,000 Turkish soldiers in Cyprus commissioned in the border zone between the north and the south|"" Levent told DW. ""[President Erdogan] might incite provocation and that's what worries me the most.""

Since April, the capital, Tripoli, has been under siege by militias led by General Khalifa Haftar. To date, this offensive marks the high point of tensions between the two groups vying for leadership: Haftar and his militias in the east of the country, and the UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) led by Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj in northwestern Libya. In early July, the Tajoura refugee camp, located east of Tripoli, got caught up between the front lines. According to the UN, 53 people were killed in two air raids targeting the camp; some 130 were injured. The UN indicated the attacks could amount to war crimes — an accident could be ruled out since both warring parties had received the camp's geographic coordinates in order to avoid exactly that kind of attack. The GNA, internationally recognized as Libya's leadership, blamed Haftar and his Libyan National Army (LNA). Haftar, however, has rejected any responsibility. The UN Security Council condemned the airstrikes in the strongest terms and intended to emphasize the point with an official statement. That was when the US delegation put its foot down, without providing a specific reason. Such a condemnation from the UN could have been seen as a criticism of Haftar's approach — and President Donald Trump publicly pledged support for Haftar in April. Read more: Khalifa Haftar: Libya's military strongman Change of tack in US policy In a phone call between Trump and Haftar on April 15, the US president ""recognized Field Marshal Haftar's significant role in fighting terrorism and securing Libya's oil resources|"" according to a White House statement published several days later. ""The two discussed a shared vision for Libya's transition to a stable, democratic political system."" When he's dealing with the outside world, Haftar presents himself as a campaigner for a free Libya where extremists have no place. He's the strongman who drives terrorist organizations like ""Islamic State"" out of the country, the general claims. That is, of course, to Trump's liking. Send Facebook Twitter google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/3LYxL But publicizing the conversation with Haftar was an unusual step, as the US still officially recognizes the administration led by al-Sarraj as Libya's legitimate government. Just several days prior to the phone call, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had criticized Haftar's Tripoli offensive in the strongest terms. ""We have made clear that we oppose the military offensive by Khalifa Haftar's forces and urge the immediate halt to these military operations against the Libyan capital|"" Pompeo said on April 8. Trump's friendly phone call has signaled the opposite, namely that Haftar has ""been given a green light by the United States to continue. And that's disastrous|"" Jeffrey Feltman told DW. The US diplomat was UN undersecretary for political affairs from 2012 to 2018 and US assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs from 2009 to 2012. ""You've seen the US try to have it both ways: To not look as though they're backing a brutal military assault on Tripoli, while also not backing away from Haftar|"" Feltman told DW. ""Appearing to back Haftar's move on Tripoli is a mistake that undermines any hope for a successful political process."" Read more: Could Libya be Russia's new Syria? Haftar has 'little regard for democracy' The US is not the only Security Council member to support Haftar. Officially, Russia and France have recognized the Government of National Accord, but according to experts, they simultaneously back Haftar. In addition, several countries in the region are ignoring an arms embargo which the UN body adopted in 2011. Egypt and the United Arab Emirates supply arms to Haftar, and financially support the LNA. Both countries are partners with the US, but the Trump administration has not used his influence to clamp down on those arms supplies. Washington's behavior had ""given a green light to Haftar's regional supporters who are violating the UN arms embargo|"" said Frederic Wehrey, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank. ""So it's been, I think, tremendously damaging to peace and US interests."" Wehrey, who met Haftar in 2014, believes it's unlikely the general will halt his military campaign without pressure from third parties. ""Haftar has long said that he wants to rule the country|"" Wehrey told DW. ""He has very little regard for democracy and pluralistic politics. He believes Libya should be ruled with a strong hand, and preferably under him."" A health system crisis is looming in Libya. Particularly the western parts of the country are running out of drinkable water. 101 of 149 conduits of the water supply system have already been destroyed in the wake of the chaotic situation in the country. Libya is mainly made up of arid desert. Under dictator Muammar Gaddafi, the 1980s saw the construction of a vast pipeline system known as the ""Great Man-Made River."" Those pipelines supply more than 70 percent of Libya's population with fresh water. However, since the fall of Gaddafi, the system has been damaged time and again. Since Gaddafi was toppled in 2011, the country has descended into chaos. The internationally recognized government in Tripoli is weak and not in control of large parts of Libya. On the other hand, renegade General Khalifa Haftar and his self-styled Libya National Army (LNA) control large areas predominantly in the east of the country. The LNA, in particular, uses the water pipeline system in order to push through its demands, thereby endangering Libya's population. In May, armed forces loyal to Haftar forced water supply employees to cut off the main water pipeline to the besieged capital, Tripoli, for two days, in a bid to press authorities to release a prisoner. It's not only the rebel groups who exploit the water supply system to push through their interests. There are also people who dismantle wellheads, in order to sell the copper those heads are made of. The United Nations have warned all sides in Libya not to use water as a weapon of war. Mostafa Omar, a UNICEF spokesman for Libya, estimates that, in future, some four million people might be deprived of access to safe drinking water if no solution to the conflict is found. This could result in an outbreak of hepatitis A, cholera, and other diarrhea illnesses. Water is not only scarce, but it's also contaminated in many areas. Bacteria or a high content of salt make it unfit for consumption. 'Often, in fact, it's no longer drinkable water,' says Badr al-Din al-Najjar, the head of Libya's National Center for Disease Control. Author: Lisa Hänel Outside influence a decisive factor Currently, neither Haftar and his LNA nor the Government of National Accord give the impression they are working toward a diplomatic solution. This is why it's crucial that other countries take action, experts have said. ""The US should first of all call for a ceasefire. It needs to be very forceful in holding all sides accountable for their actions on the battlefield. Most importantly, the US needs to exert diplomatic leverage toward the regional states that are interfering in Libya, sending in weapons and really pouring gasoline on the fire|"" said Wehrey. However, he does not believe Washington will apply pressure on its key associates, Egypt and the UAE. ""I don't think that's going to happen because of other US concerns, personal ties between the Trump administration [and the two countries]|"" he said. In addition, there were important ""other regional factors, like the Iran concern."" Feltman warned that if world powers like the US did not commit to a political peace process and bring the warring factions to the negotiating table, the civil war could have dire consequences for the people in Libya, and Tripoli in particular. Both sides had to ""finally roll up their sleeves and work out their differences politically, "" he said. Otherwise ""it could very easily become like Aleppo. And why would anyone want that?""
